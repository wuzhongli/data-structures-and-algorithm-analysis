<li class="L41" rel="L41">It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession</li>
<li class="L42" rel="L42">of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.</li>
<li class="L43" rel="L43"></li>
<li class="L44" rel="L44">However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his</li>
<li class="L45" rel="L45">first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds</li>
<li class="L46" rel="L46">of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property</li>

<li class="L52" rel="L52">Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.</li>
<li class="L53" rel="L53"></li>
<li class="L54" rel="L54">“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she</li>

<li class="L56" rel="L56"></li>
<li class="L57" rel="L57">Mr. Bennet made no answer.</li>
<li class="L58" rel="L58"></li>
<li class="L59" rel="L59">“Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife impatiently.</li>
<li class="L60" rel="L60"></li>

<li class="L65" rel="L65">“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken</li>
<li class="L66" rel="L66">by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came</li>
<li class="L67" rel="L67">down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much</li>

<li class="L69" rel="L69">is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to</li>
<li class="L70" rel="L70">be in the house by the end of next week.”</li>
<li class="L71" rel="L71"></li>
<li class="L72" rel="L72">“What is his name?”</li>
<li class="L73" rel="L73"></li>
<li class="L74" rel="L74">“Bingley.”</li>
<li class="L75" rel="L75"></li>
<li class="L76" rel="L76">“Is he married or single?”</li>
<li class="L77" rel="L77"></li>
<li class="L78" rel="L78">“Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or</li>
<li class="L79" rel="L79">five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”</li>
<li class="L80" rel="L80"></li>
<li class="L81" rel="L81">“How so? How can it affect them?”</li>
<li class="L82" rel="L82"></li>
<li class="L83" rel="L83">“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome! You</li>
<li class="L84" rel="L84">must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”</li>
<li class="L85" rel="L85"></li>
<li class="L86" rel="L86">“Is that his design in settling here?”</li>
<li class="L87" rel="L87"></li>
<li class="L88" rel="L88">“Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he</li>
<li class="L89" rel="L89">_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as</li>
<li class="L90" rel="L90">soon as he comes.”</li>
<li class="L91" rel="L91"></li>
<li class="L92" rel="L92">“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send</li>
<li class="L93" rel="L93">them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are</li>
<li class="L94" rel="L94">as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the</li>
<li class="L95" rel="L95">party.”</li>
<li class="L96" rel="L96"></li>
<li class="L97" rel="L97">“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but</li>
<li class="L98" rel="L98">I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five</li>
<li class="L99" rel="L99">grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”</li>
<li class="L100" rel="L100"></li>
<li class="L101" rel="L101">“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”</li>
<li class="L102" rel="L102"></li>
<li class="L103" rel="L103">“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into</li>
<li class="L104" rel="L104">the neighbourhood.”</li>
<li class="L105" rel="L105"></li>
<li class="L106" rel="L106">“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”</li>
<li class="L107" rel="L107"></li>
<li class="L108" rel="L108">“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would</li>
<li class="L109" rel="L109">be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to</li>
<li class="L110" rel="L110">go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no</li>
<li class="L111" rel="L111">newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to</li>
<li class="L112" rel="L112">visit him if you do not.”</li>
<li class="L113" rel="L113"></li>
<li class="L114" rel="L114">“You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very</li>
<li class="L115" rel="L115">glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my</li>
<li class="L116" rel="L116">hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though</li>
<li class="L117" rel="L117">I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”</li>
<li class="L118" rel="L118"></li>
<li class="L119" rel="L119">“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the</li>
<li class="L120" rel="L120">others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so</li>
<li class="L121" rel="L121">good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.”</li>
<li class="L122" rel="L122"></li>
<li class="L123" rel="L123">“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he; “they are</li>
<li class="L124" rel="L124">all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of</li>
<li class="L125" rel="L125">quickness than her sisters.”</li>
<li class="L126" rel="L126"></li>
<li class="L127" rel="L127">“Mr. Bennet, how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way? You</li>
<li class="L128" rel="L128">take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.”</li>
<li class="L129" rel="L129"></li>
<li class="L130" rel="L130">“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They</li>
<li class="L131" rel="L131">are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration</li>
<li class="L132" rel="L132">these last twenty years at least.”</li>
<li class="L133" rel="L133"></li>
<li class="L134" rel="L134">“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”</li>
<li class="L135" rel="L135"></li>
<li class="L136" rel="L136">“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four</li>
<li class="L137" rel="L137">thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”</li>
<li class="L138" rel="L138"></li>
<li class="L139" rel="L139">“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not</li>
<li class="L140" rel="L140">visit them.”</li>
<li class="L141" rel="L141"></li>
<li class="L142" rel="L142">“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them</li>
<li class="L143" rel="L143">all.”</li>
<li class="L144" rel="L144"></li>
<li class="L145" rel="L145">Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,</li>
<li class="L146" rel="L146">reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had</li>
<li class="L147" rel="L147">been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind</li>
<li class="L148" rel="L148">was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,</li>
<li class="L149" rel="L149">little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented,</li>
<li class="L150" rel="L150">she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her</li>
<li class="L151" rel="L151">daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.</li>
<li class="L152" rel="L152"></li>
<li class="L153" rel="L153"></li>
<li class="L154" rel="L154"></li>
<li class="L155" rel="L155">Chapter 2</li>
<li class="L156" rel="L156"></li>
<li class="L157" rel="L157"></li>
<li class="L158" rel="L158">Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He</li>
<li class="L159" rel="L159">had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring</li>
<li class="L160" rel="L160">his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was</li>
<li class="L161" rel="L161">paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following</li>
<li class="L162" rel="L162">manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he</li>
<li class="L163" rel="L163">suddenly addressed her with:</li>
<li class="L164" rel="L164"></li>
<li class="L165" rel="L165">“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”</li>
<li class="L166" rel="L166"></li>
<li class="L167" rel="L167">“We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother</li>
<li class="L168" rel="L168">resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”</li>
<li class="L169" rel="L169"></li>
<li class="L170" rel="L170">“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the</li>
<li class="L171" rel="L171">assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.”</li>
<li class="L172" rel="L172"></li>
<li class="L173" rel="L173">“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces</li>
<li class="L174" rel="L174">of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion</li>
<li class="L175" rel="L175">of her.”</li>
<li class="L176" rel="L176"></li>
<li class="L177" rel="L177">“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do</li>
<li class="L178" rel="L178">not depend on her serving you.”</li>
<li class="L179" rel="L179"></li>
<li class="L180" rel="L180">Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain</li>
<li class="L181" rel="L181">herself, began scolding one of her daughters.</li>
<li class="L182" rel="L182"></li>
<li class="L183" rel="L183">“Don&#39;t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven&#39;s sake! Have a little</li>
<li class="L184" rel="L184">compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”</li>
<li class="L185" rel="L185"></li>
<li class="L186" rel="L186">“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times</li>
<li class="L187" rel="L187">them ill.”</li>
<li class="L188" rel="L188"></li>
<li class="L189" rel="L189">“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully. “When is</li>
<li class="L190" rel="L190">your next ball to be, Lizzy?”</li>
<li class="L191" rel="L191"></li>
<li class="L192" rel="L192">“To-morrow fortnight.”</li>
<li class="L193" rel="L193"></li>
<li class="L194" rel="L194">“Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back</li>
<li class="L195" rel="L195">till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him,</li>
<li class="L196" rel="L196">for she will not know him herself.”</li>
<li class="L197" rel="L197"></li>
<li class="L198" rel="L198">“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce</li>
<li class="L199" rel="L199">Mr. Bingley to _her_.”</li>
<li class="L200" rel="L200"></li>
<li class="L201" rel="L201">“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him</li>
<li class="L202" rel="L202">myself; how can you be so teasing?”</li>
<li class="L203" rel="L203"></li>
<li class="L204" rel="L204">“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight&#39;s acquaintance is certainly</li>
<li class="L205" rel="L205">very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a</li>
<li class="L206" rel="L206">fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else will; and after all,</li>
<li class="L207" rel="L207">Mrs. Long and her neices must stand their chance; and, therefore, as</li>
<li class="L208" rel="L208">she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will</li>
<li class="L209" rel="L209">take it on myself.”</li>
<li class="L210" rel="L210"></li>
<li class="L211" rel="L211">The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,</li>
<li class="L212" rel="L212">nonsense!”</li>
<li class="L213" rel="L213"></li>
<li class="L214" rel="L214">“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do</li>
<li class="L215" rel="L215">you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on</li>
<li class="L216" rel="L216">them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,</li>
<li class="L217" rel="L217">Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read</li>
<li class="L218" rel="L218">great books and make extracts.”</li>
<li class="L219" rel="L219"></li>
<li class="L220" rel="L220">Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.</li>
<li class="L221" rel="L221"></li>
<li class="L222" rel="L222">“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.</li>
<li class="L223" rel="L223">Bingley.”</li>
<li class="L224" rel="L224"></li>
<li class="L225" rel="L225">“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.</li>
<li class="L226" rel="L226"></li>
<li class="L227" rel="L227">“I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that before? If</li>
<li class="L228" rel="L228">I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called</li>
<li class="L229" rel="L229">on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we</li>
<li class="L230" rel="L230">cannot escape the acquaintance now.”</li>
<li class="L231" rel="L231"></li>
<li class="L232" rel="L232">The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.</li>
<li class="L233" rel="L233">Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy</li>
<li class="L234" rel="L234">was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the</li>
<li class="L235" rel="L235">while.</li>
<li class="L236" rel="L236"></li>
<li class="L237" rel="L237">“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should</li>
<li class="L238" rel="L238">persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to</li>
<li class="L239" rel="L239">neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a</li>
<li class="L240" rel="L240">good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a</li>
<li class="L241" rel="L241">word about it till now.”</li>
<li class="L242" rel="L242"></li>
<li class="L243" rel="L243">“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and,</li>
<li class="L244" rel="L244">as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.</li>
<li class="L245" rel="L245"></li>
<li class="L246" rel="L246">“What an excellent father you have, girls!” said she, when the door was</li>
<li class="L247" rel="L247">shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;</li>
<li class="L248" rel="L248">or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so</li>
<li class="L249" rel="L249">pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but</li>
<li class="L250" rel="L250">for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_</li>
<li class="L251" rel="L251">the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next</li>
<li class="L252" rel="L252">ball.”</li>
<li class="L253" rel="L253"></li>
<li class="L254" rel="L254">“Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the</li>
<li class="L255" rel="L255">youngest, I&#39;m the tallest.”</li>
<li class="L256" rel="L256"></li>
<li class="L257" rel="L257">The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would</li>
<li class="L258" rel="L258">return Mr. Bennet&#39;s visit, and determining when they should ask him to</li>
<li class="L259" rel="L259">dinner.</li>
<li class="L260" rel="L260"></li>
<li class="L261" rel="L261"></li>
<li class="L262" rel="L262"></li>
<li class="L263" rel="L263">Chapter 3</li>
<li class="L264" rel="L264"></li>
<li class="L265" rel="L265"></li>
<li class="L266" rel="L266">Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five</li>
<li class="L267" rel="L267">daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her</li>
<li class="L268" rel="L268">husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him</li>
<li class="L269" rel="L269">in various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and</li>
<li class="L270" rel="L270">distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at</li>
<li class="L271" rel="L271">last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,</li>
<li class="L272" rel="L272">Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been</li>
<li class="L273" rel="L273">delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely</li>
<li class="L274" rel="L274">agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly</li>
<li class="L275" rel="L275">with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of</li>
<li class="L276" rel="L276">dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively</li>
<li class="L277" rel="L277">hopes of Mr. Bingley&#39;s heart were entertained.</li>
<li class="L278" rel="L278"></li>
<li class="L279" rel="L279">“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,”</li>
<li class="L280" rel="L280"> said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well</li>
<li class="L281" rel="L281">married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”</li>
<li class="L282" rel="L282"></li>
<li class="L283" rel="L283">In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet&#39;s visit, and sat about</li>
<li class="L284" rel="L284">ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being</li>
<li class="L285" rel="L285">admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had</li>
<li class="L286" rel="L286">heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more</li>
<li class="L287" rel="L287">fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper</li>
<li class="L288" rel="L288">window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.</li>
<li class="L289" rel="L289"></li>
<li class="L290" rel="L290">An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already</li>
<li class="L291" rel="L291">had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her</li>
<li class="L292" rel="L292">housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley</li>
<li class="L293" rel="L293">was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable</li>
<li class="L294" rel="L294">to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite</li>
<li class="L295" rel="L295">disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town</li>
<li class="L296" rel="L296">so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that</li>
<li class="L297" rel="L297">he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never</li>
<li class="L298" rel="L298">settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears</li>
<li class="L299" rel="L299">a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get</li>
<li class="L300" rel="L300">a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley</li>
<li class="L301" rel="L301">was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.</li>
<li class="L302" rel="L302">The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the</li>
<li class="L303" rel="L303">day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only</li>
<li class="L304" rel="L304">six with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin. And when</li>
<li class="L305" rel="L305">the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five</li>
<li class="L306" rel="L306">altogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and</li>
<li class="L307" rel="L307">another young man.</li>
<li class="L308" rel="L308"></li>
<li class="L309" rel="L309">Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant</li>
<li class="L310" rel="L310">countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,</li>
<li class="L311" rel="L311">with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely</li>
<li class="L312" rel="L312">looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention</li>
<li class="L313" rel="L313">of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and</li>
<li class="L314" rel="L314">the report which was in general circulation within five minutes</li>
<li class="L315" rel="L315">after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen</li>
<li class="L316" rel="L316">pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he</li>
<li class="L317" rel="L317">was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great</li>
<li class="L318" rel="L318">admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust</li>
<li class="L319" rel="L319">which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be</li>
<li class="L320" rel="L320">proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all</li>
<li class="L321" rel="L321">his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most</li>
<li class="L322" rel="L322">forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared</li>
<li class="L323" rel="L323">with his friend.</li>
<li class="L324" rel="L324"></li>
<li class="L325" rel="L325">Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal</li>
<li class="L326" rel="L326">people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,</li>
<li class="L327" rel="L327">was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving</li>
<li class="L328" rel="L328">one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for</li>
<li class="L329" rel="L329">themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced</li>
<li class="L330" rel="L330">only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being</li>
<li class="L331" rel="L331">introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in</li>
<li class="L332" rel="L332">walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.</li>
<li class="L333" rel="L333">His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man</li>
<li class="L334" rel="L334">in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.</li>
<li class="L335" rel="L335">Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of</li>
<li class="L336" rel="L336">his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his</li>
<li class="L337" rel="L337">having slighted one of her daughters.</li>
<li class="L338" rel="L338"></li>
<li class="L339" rel="L339">Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit</li>
<li class="L340" rel="L340">down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been</li>
<li class="L341" rel="L341">standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.</li>
<li class="L342" rel="L342">Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend</li>
<li class="L343" rel="L343">to join it.</li>
<li class="L344" rel="L344"></li>
<li class="L345" rel="L345">“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you</li>
<li class="L346" rel="L346">standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better</li>
<li class="L347" rel="L347">dance.”</li>
<li class="L348" rel="L348"></li>
<li class="L349" rel="L349">“I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am</li>
<li class="L350" rel="L350">particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this</li>
<li class="L351" rel="L351">it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not</li>
<li class="L352" rel="L352">another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to</li>
<li class="L353" rel="L353">stand up with.”</li>
<li class="L354" rel="L354"></li>
<li class="L355" rel="L355">“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Mr. Bingley, “for a</li>
<li class="L356" rel="L356">kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in</li>
<li class="L357" rel="L357">my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see</li>
<li class="L358" rel="L358">uncommonly pretty.”</li>
<li class="L359" rel="L359"></li>
<li class="L360" rel="L360">“_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr.</li>
<li class="L361" rel="L361">Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.</li>
<li class="L362" rel="L362"></li>
<li class="L363" rel="L363">“Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one</li>
<li class="L364" rel="L364">of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I</li>
<li class="L365" rel="L365">dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”</li>
<li class="L366" rel="L366"></li>
<li class="L367" rel="L367">“Which do you mean?” and turning round he looked for a moment at</li>
<li class="L368" rel="L368">Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:</li>
<li class="L369" rel="L369">“She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I am in no</li>
<li class="L370" rel="L370">humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted</li>
<li class="L371" rel="L371">by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her</li>
<li class="L372" rel="L372">smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”</li>
<li class="L373" rel="L373"></li>
<li class="L374" rel="L374">Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth</li>
<li class="L375" rel="L375">remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,</li>
<li class="L376" rel="L376">however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,</li>
<li class="L377" rel="L377">playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.</li>
<li class="L378" rel="L378"></li>
<li class="L379" rel="L379">The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.</li>
<li class="L380" rel="L380">Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield</li>
<li class="L381" rel="L381">party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been</li>
<li class="L382" rel="L382">distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as</li>
<li class="L383" rel="L383">her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane&#39;s</li>
<li class="L384" rel="L384">pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most</li>
<li class="L385" rel="L385">accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been</li>
<li class="L386" rel="L386">fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they</li>
<li class="L387" rel="L387">had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good</li>
<li class="L388" rel="L388">spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they</li>
<li class="L389" rel="L389">were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With</li>
<li class="L390" rel="L390">a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a</li>
<li class="L391" rel="L391">good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised</li>
<li class="L392" rel="L392">such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife&#39;s views on</li>
<li class="L393" rel="L393">the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a</li>
<li class="L394" rel="L394">different story to hear.</li>
<li class="L395" rel="L395"></li>
<li class="L396" rel="L396">“Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most</li>
<li class="L397" rel="L397">delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.</li>
<li class="L398" rel="L398">Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well</li>
<li class="L399" rel="L399">she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with</li>
<li class="L400" rel="L400">her twice! Only think of _that_, my dear; he actually danced with her</li>
<li class="L401" rel="L401">twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second</li>
<li class="L402" rel="L402">time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand</li>
<li class="L403" rel="L403">up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody</li>
<li class="L404" rel="L404">can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going</li>
<li class="L405" rel="L405">down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and</li>
<li class="L406" rel="L406">asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King,</li>
<li class="L407" rel="L407">and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again,</li>
<li class="L408" rel="L408">and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_--”</li>
<li class="L409" rel="L409"></li>
<li class="L410" rel="L410">“If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,</li>
<li class="L411" rel="L411">“he would not have danced half so much! For God&#39;s sake, say no more of</li>
<li class="L412" rel="L412">his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!”</li>
<li class="L413" rel="L413"></li>
<li class="L414" rel="L414">“Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively</li>
<li class="L415" rel="L415">handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw</li>
<li class="L416" rel="L416">anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.</li>
<li class="L417" rel="L417">Hurst&#39;s gown--”</li>
<li class="L418" rel="L418"></li>
<li class="L419" rel="L419">Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any</li>
<li class="L420" rel="L420">description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch</li>
<li class="L421" rel="L421">of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some</li>
<li class="L422" rel="L422">exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.</li>
<li class="L423" rel="L423"></li>
<li class="L424" rel="L424">“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not</li>
<li class="L425" rel="L425">suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at</li>
<li class="L426" rel="L426">all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring</li>
<li class="L427" rel="L427">him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very</li>
<li class="L428" rel="L428">great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my</li>
<li class="L429" rel="L429">dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”</li>
<li class="L430" rel="L430"></li>

<li class="L433" rel="L433">Chapter 4</li>
<li class="L434" rel="L434"></li>
<li class="L435" rel="L435"></li>
<li class="L436" rel="L436">When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in</li>
<li class="L437" rel="L437">her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very</li>
<li class="L438" rel="L438">much she admired him.</li>
<li class="L439" rel="L439"></li>
<li class="L440" rel="L440">“He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,</li>
<li class="L441" rel="L441">good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much</li>
<li class="L442" rel="L442">ease, with such perfect good breeding!”</li>
<li class="L443" rel="L443"></li>
<li class="L444" rel="L444">“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought</li>
<li class="L445" rel="L445">likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.”</li>
<li class="L446" rel="L446"></li>
<li class="L447" rel="L447">“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I</li>
<li class="L448" rel="L448">did not expect such a compliment.”</li>
<li class="L449" rel="L449"></li>
<li class="L450" rel="L450">“Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between</li>
<li class="L451" rel="L451">us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What</li>
<li class="L452" rel="L452">could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help</li>
<li class="L453" rel="L453">seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman</li>
<li class="L454" rel="L454">in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is</li>
<li class="L455" rel="L455">very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a</li>
<li class="L456" rel="L456">stupider person.”</li>
<li class="L457" rel="L457"></li>
<li class="L458" rel="L458">“Dear Lizzy!”</li>
<li class="L459" rel="L459"></li>
<li class="L460" rel="L460">“Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.</li>
<li class="L461" rel="L461">You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable</li>
<li class="L462" rel="L462">in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your</li>
<li class="L463" rel="L463">life.”</li>
<li class="L464" rel="L464"></li>
<li class="L465" rel="L465">“I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak</li>
<li class="L466" rel="L466">what I think.”</li>
<li class="L467" rel="L467"></li>
<li class="L468" rel="L468">“I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_</li>
<li class="L469" rel="L469">good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of</li>
<li class="L470" rel="L470">others! Affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with it</li>
<li class="L471" rel="L471">everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the</li>
<li class="L472" rel="L472">good of everybody&#39;s character and make it still better, and say nothing</li>
<li class="L473" rel="L473">of the bad--belongs to you alone. And so you like this man&#39;s sisters,</li>
<li class="L474" rel="L474">too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.”</li>
<li class="L475" rel="L475"></li>
<li class="L476" rel="L476">“Certainly not--at first. But they are very pleasing women when you</li>
<li class="L477" rel="L477">converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep</li>
<li class="L478" rel="L478">his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming</li>
<li class="L479" rel="L479">neighbour in her.”</li>
<li class="L480" rel="L480"></li>
<li class="L481" rel="L481">Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at</li>
<li class="L482" rel="L482">the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more</li>
<li class="L483" rel="L483">quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister,</li>
<li class="L484" rel="L484">and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she</li>
<li class="L485" rel="L485">was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine</li>
<li class="L486" rel="L486">ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the</li>
<li class="L487" rel="L487">power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and</li>
<li class="L488" rel="L488">conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the</li>
<li class="L489" rel="L489">first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand</li>
<li class="L490" rel="L490">pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of</li>
<li class="L491" rel="L491">associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect</li>
<li class="L492" rel="L492">entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of</li>
<li class="L493" rel="L493">a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply</li>
<li class="L494" rel="L494">impressed on their memories than that their brother&#39;s fortune and their</li>
<li class="L495" rel="L495">own had been acquired by trade.</li>
<li class="L496" rel="L496"></li>
<li class="L497" rel="L497">Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred</li>
<li class="L498" rel="L498">thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an</li>
<li class="L499" rel="L499">estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and</li>
<li class="L500" rel="L500">sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a</li>
<li class="L501" rel="L501">good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those</li>
<li class="L502" rel="L502">who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the</li>
<li class="L503" rel="L503">remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to</li>
<li class="L504" rel="L504">purchase.</li>
<li class="L505" rel="L505"></li>
<li class="L506" rel="L506">His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,</li>
<li class="L507" rel="L507">though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no</li>
<li class="L508" rel="L508">means unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had</li>
<li class="L509" rel="L509">married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider</li>
<li class="L510" rel="L510">his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of</li>
<li class="L511" rel="L511">age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation</li>
<li class="L512" rel="L512">to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for</li>
<li class="L513" rel="L513">half-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principal</li>
<li class="L514" rel="L514">rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it</li>
<li class="L515" rel="L515">immediately.</li>
<li class="L516" rel="L516"></li>
<li class="L517" rel="L517">Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of</li>
<li class="L518" rel="L518">great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the</li>
<li class="L519" rel="L519">easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition</li>
<li class="L520" rel="L520">could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he</li>
<li class="L521" rel="L521">never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy&#39;s regard, Bingley</li>
<li class="L522" rel="L522">had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion.</li>
<li class="L523" rel="L523">In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means</li>
<li class="L524" rel="L524">deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,</li>
<li class="L525" rel="L525">reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not</li>
<li class="L526" rel="L526">inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley</li>
<li class="L527" rel="L527">was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually</li>
<li class="L528" rel="L528">giving offense.</li>
<li class="L529" rel="L529"></li>
<li class="L530" rel="L530">The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently</li>
<li class="L531" rel="L531">characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or</li>
<li class="L532" rel="L532">prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive</li>
<li class="L533" rel="L533">to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt</li>
<li class="L534" rel="L534">acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not</li>
<li class="L535" rel="L535">conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a</li>
<li class="L536" rel="L536">collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for</li>
<li class="L537" rel="L537">none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received</li>
<li class="L538" rel="L538">either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,</li>
<li class="L539" rel="L539">but she smiled too much.</li>
<li class="L540" rel="L540"></li>
<li class="L541" rel="L541">Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired</li>
<li class="L542" rel="L542">her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one</li>
<li class="L543" rel="L543">whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore</li>
<li class="L544" rel="L544">established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such</li>
<li class="L545" rel="L545">commendation to think of her as he chose.</li>
<li class="L546" rel="L546"></li>
<li class="L547" rel="L547"></li>
<li class="L548" rel="L548"></li>
<li class="L549" rel="L549">Chapter 5</li>
<li class="L550" rel="L550"></li>
<li class="L551" rel="L551"></li>
<li class="L552" rel="L552">Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets</li>
<li class="L553" rel="L553">were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade</li>
<li class="L554" rel="L554">in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the</li>
<li class="L555" rel="L555">honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.</li>
<li class="L556" rel="L556">The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a</li>
<li class="L557" rel="L557">disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town;</li>
<li class="L558" rel="L558">and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house</li>
<li class="L559" rel="L559">about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge,</li>
<li class="L560" rel="L560">where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and,</li>
<li class="L561" rel="L561">unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all</li>
<li class="L562" rel="L562">the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him</li>
<li class="L563" rel="L563">supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By</li>
<li class="L564" rel="L564">nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.</li>
<li class="L565" rel="L565">James&#39;s had made him courteous.</li>
<li class="L566" rel="L566"></li>
<li class="L567" rel="L567">Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a</li>
<li class="L568" rel="L568">valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest</li>
<li class="L569" rel="L569">of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was</li>
<li class="L570" rel="L570">Elizabeth&#39;s intimate friend.</li>
<li class="L571" rel="L571"></li>
<li class="L572" rel="L572">That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over</li>
<li class="L573" rel="L573">a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly</li>
<li class="L574" rel="L574">brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.</li>
<li class="L575" rel="L575"></li>
<li class="L576" rel="L576">“_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet with civil</li>
<li class="L577" rel="L577">self-command to Miss Lucas. “_You_ were Mr. Bingley&#39;s first choice.”</li>
<li class="L578" rel="L578"></li>
<li class="L579" rel="L579">“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”</li>
<li class="L580" rel="L580"></li>
<li class="L581" rel="L581">“Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be</li>
<li class="L582" rel="L582">sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he</li>
<li class="L583" rel="L583">_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something</li>
<li class="L584" rel="L584">about Mr. Robinson.”</li>
<li class="L585" rel="L585"></li>
<li class="L586" rel="L586">“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not</li>
<li class="L587" rel="L587">I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson&#39;s asking him how he liked our Meryton</li>
<li class="L588" rel="L588">assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many</li>
<li class="L589" rel="L589">pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his</li>
<li class="L590" rel="L590">answering immediately to the last question: &#39;Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,</li>
<li class="L591" rel="L591">beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.&#39;”</li>
<li class="L592" rel="L592"></li>
<li class="L593" rel="L593">“Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed--that does seem as</li>
<li class="L594" rel="L594">if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”</li>
<li class="L595" rel="L595"></li>
<li class="L596" rel="L596">“_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,” said</li>
<li class="L597" rel="L597">Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,</li>
<li class="L598" rel="L598">is he?--poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_.”</li>
<li class="L599" rel="L599"></li>
<li class="L600" rel="L600">“I beg you would not put it into Lizzy&#39;s head to be vexed by his</li>
<li class="L601" rel="L601">ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite</li>
<li class="L602" rel="L602">a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he</li>
<li class="L603" rel="L603">sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.”</li>
<li class="L604" rel="L604"></li>
<li class="L605" rel="L605">“Are you quite sure, ma&#39;am?--is not there a little mistake?” said Jane.</li>
<li class="L606" rel="L606">“I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”</li>
<li class="L607" rel="L607"></li>
<li class="L608" rel="L608">“Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he</li>
<li class="L609" rel="L609">could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at</li>
<li class="L610" rel="L610">being spoke to.”</li>
<li class="L611" rel="L611"></li>
<li class="L612" rel="L612">“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much,</li>
<li class="L613" rel="L613">unless among his intimate acquaintances. With _them_ he is remarkably</li>
<li class="L614" rel="L614">agreeable.”</li>
<li class="L615" rel="L615"></li>
<li class="L616" rel="L616">“I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very</li>
<li class="L617" rel="L617">agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it</li>
<li class="L618" rel="L618">was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had</li>
<li class="L619" rel="L619">heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to</li>
<li class="L620" rel="L620">the ball in a hack chaise.”</li>
<li class="L621" rel="L621"></li>
<li class="L622" rel="L622">“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I</li>
<li class="L623" rel="L623">wish he had danced with Eliza.”</li>
<li class="L624" rel="L624"></li>
<li class="L625" rel="L625">“Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with _him_,</li>
<li class="L626" rel="L626">if I were you.”</li>
<li class="L627" rel="L627"></li>
<li class="L628" rel="L628">“I believe, ma&#39;am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.”</li>
<li class="L629" rel="L629"></li>
<li class="L630" rel="L630">“His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as pride</li>
<li class="L631" rel="L631">often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so</li>
<li class="L632" rel="L632">very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,</li>
<li class="L633" rel="L633">should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_</li>
<li class="L634" rel="L634">to be proud.”</li>
<li class="L635" rel="L635"></li>
<li class="L636" rel="L636">“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive</li>
<li class="L637" rel="L637">_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”</li>
<li class="L638" rel="L638"></li>
<li class="L639" rel="L639">“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her</li>
<li class="L640" rel="L640">reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have</li>
<li class="L641" rel="L641">ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human</li>
<li class="L642" rel="L642">nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us</li>
<li class="L643" rel="L643">who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some</li>
<li class="L644" rel="L644">quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different</li>
<li class="L645" rel="L645">things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may</li>
<li class="L646" rel="L646">be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of</li>
<li class="L647" rel="L647">ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.”</li>
<li class="L648" rel="L648"></li>
<li class="L649" rel="L649">“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with</li>
<li class="L650" rel="L650">his sisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of</li>
<li class="L651" rel="L651">foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.”</li>
<li class="L652" rel="L652"></li>
<li class="L653" rel="L653">“Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs.</li>
<li class="L654" rel="L654">Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle</li>
<li class="L655" rel="L655">directly.”</li>
<li class="L656" rel="L656"></li>
<li class="L657" rel="L657">The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she</li>
<li class="L658" rel="L658">would, and the argument ended only with the visit.</li>
<li class="L659" rel="L659"></li>
<li class="L660" rel="L660"></li>
<li class="L661" rel="L661"></li>
<li class="L662" rel="L662">Chapter 6</li>
<li class="L663" rel="L663"></li>
<li class="L664" rel="L664"></li>
<li class="L665" rel="L665">The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit</li>
<li class="L666" rel="L666">was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet&#39;s pleasing manners grew on</li>
<li class="L667" rel="L667">the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was</li>
<li class="L668" rel="L668">found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,</li>
<li class="L669" rel="L669">a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards</li>
<li class="L670" rel="L670">the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest</li>
<li class="L671" rel="L671">pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment</li>
<li class="L672" rel="L672">of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;</li>
<li class="L673" rel="L673">though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in</li>
<li class="L674" rel="L674">all probability from the influence of their brother&#39;s admiration. It</li>
<li class="L675" rel="L675">was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her and</li>
<li class="L676" rel="L676">to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference</li>
<li class="L677" rel="L677">which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a</li>
<li class="L678" rel="L678">way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it</li>
<li class="L679" rel="L679">was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane</li>
<li class="L680" rel="L680">united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a</li>
<li class="L681" rel="L681">uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions</li>
<li class="L682" rel="L682">of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.</li>
<li class="L683" rel="L683"></li>
<li class="L684" rel="L684">“It may perhaps be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose</li>
<li class="L685" rel="L685">on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be</li>
<li class="L686" rel="L686">so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill</li>
<li class="L687" rel="L687">from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and</li>
<li class="L688" rel="L688">it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in</li>
<li class="L689" rel="L689">the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every</li>
<li class="L690" rel="L690">attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all</li>
<li class="L691" rel="L691">_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are</li>
<li class="L692" rel="L692">very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without</li>
<li class="L693" rel="L693">encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show _more_</li>
<li class="L694" rel="L694">affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he</li>
<li class="L695" rel="L695">may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”</li>
<li class="L696" rel="L696"></li>
<li class="L697" rel="L697">“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can</li>
<li class="L698" rel="L698">perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to</li>
<li class="L699" rel="L699">discover it too.”</li>
<li class="L700" rel="L700"></li>
<li class="L701" rel="L701">“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane&#39;s disposition as you do.”</li>
<li class="L702" rel="L702"></li>
<li class="L703" rel="L703">“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal</li>
<li class="L704" rel="L704">it, he must find it out.”</li>
<li class="L705" rel="L705"></li>
<li class="L706" rel="L706">“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane</li>
<li class="L707" rel="L707">meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they</li>
<li class="L708" rel="L708">always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that</li>
<li class="L709" rel="L709">every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should</li>
<li class="L710" rel="L710">therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his</li>
<li class="L711" rel="L711">attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for</li>
<li class="L712" rel="L712">falling in love as much as she chooses.”</li>
<li class="L713" rel="L713"></li>
<li class="L714" rel="L714">“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in</li>
<li class="L715" rel="L715">question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined</li>
<li class="L716" rel="L716">to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But</li>
<li class="L717" rel="L717">these are not Jane&#39;s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet,</li>
<li class="L718" rel="L718">she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its</li>
<li class="L719" rel="L719">reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four</li>
<li class="L720" rel="L720">dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,</li>
<li class="L721" rel="L721">and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite</li>
<li class="L722" rel="L722">enough to make her understand his character.”</li>
<li class="L723" rel="L723"></li>
<li class="L724" rel="L724">“Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might</li>
<li class="L725" rel="L725">only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must</li>
<li class="L726" rel="L726">remember that four evenings have also been spent together--and four</li>
<li class="L727" rel="L727">evenings may do a great deal.”</li>
<li class="L728" rel="L728"></li>
<li class="L729" rel="L729">“Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they</li>
<li class="L730" rel="L730">both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other</li>
<li class="L731" rel="L731">leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”</li>
<li class="L732" rel="L732"></li>
<li class="L733" rel="L733">“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and</li>
<li class="L734" rel="L734">if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a</li>
<li class="L735" rel="L735">chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a</li>
<li class="L736" rel="L736">twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If</li>
<li class="L737" rel="L737">the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or</li>
<li class="L738" rel="L738">ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the</li>
<li class="L739" rel="L739">least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to</li>
<li class="L740" rel="L740">have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as</li>
<li class="L741" rel="L741">possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your</li>
<li class="L742" rel="L742">life.”</li>
<li class="L743" rel="L743"></li>
<li class="L744" rel="L744">“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not</li>
<li class="L745" rel="L745">sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”</li>
<li class="L746" rel="L746"></li>
<li class="L747" rel="L747">Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley&#39;s attentions to her sister, Elizabeth</li>
<li class="L748" rel="L748">was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some</li>
<li class="L749" rel="L749">interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely</li>
<li class="L750" rel="L750">allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the</li>
<li class="L751" rel="L751">ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no</li>
<li class="L752" rel="L752">sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly</li>
<li class="L753" rel="L753">had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered</li>
<li class="L754" rel="L754">uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To</li>
<li class="L755" rel="L755">this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had</li>
<li class="L756" rel="L756">detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry</li>
<li class="L757" rel="L757">in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and</li>
<li class="L758" rel="L758">pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those</li>
<li class="L759" rel="L759">of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of</li>
<li class="L760" rel="L760">this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made</li>
<li class="L761" rel="L761">himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough</li>
<li class="L762" rel="L762">to dance with.</li>
<li class="L763" rel="L763"></li>
<li class="L764" rel="L764">He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing</li>
<li class="L765" rel="L765">with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so</li>
<li class="L766" rel="L766">drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas&#39;s, where a large party were</li>
<li class="L767" rel="L767">assembled.</li>
<li class="L768" rel="L768"></li>
<li class="L769" rel="L769">“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my</li>
<li class="L770" rel="L770">conversation with Colonel Forster?”</li>
<li class="L771" rel="L771"></li>
<li class="L772" rel="L772">“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”</li>
<li class="L773" rel="L773"></li>
<li class="L774" rel="L774">“But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see</li>
<li class="L775" rel="L775">what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by</li>
<li class="L776" rel="L776">being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”</li>
<li class="L777" rel="L777"></li>
<li class="L778" rel="L778">On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have</li>
<li class="L779" rel="L779">any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such</li>
<li class="L780" rel="L780">a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she</li>
<li class="L781" rel="L781">turned to him and said:</li>
<li class="L782" rel="L782"></li>
<li class="L783" rel="L783">“Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly</li>
<li class="L784" rel="L784">well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at</li>
<li class="L785" rel="L785">Meryton?”</li>
<li class="L786" rel="L786"></li>
<li class="L787" rel="L787">“With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady</li>
<li class="L788" rel="L788">energetic.”</li>
<li class="L789" rel="L789"></li>
<li class="L790" rel="L790">“You are severe on us.”</li>
<li class="L791" rel="L791"></li>
<li class="L792" rel="L792">“It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am going</li>
<li class="L793" rel="L793">to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”</li>
<li class="L794" rel="L794"></li>
<li class="L795" rel="L795">“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me</li>
<li class="L796" rel="L796">to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken</li>
<li class="L797" rel="L797">a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would</li>
<li class="L798" rel="L798">really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of</li>
<li class="L799" rel="L799">hearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas&#39;s persevering, however,</li>
<li class="L800" rel="L800">she added, “Very well, if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing</li>
<li class="L801" rel="L801">at Mr. Darcy, “There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of</li>
<li class="L802" rel="L802">course familiar with: &#39;Keep your breath to cool your porridge&#39;; and I</li>
<li class="L803" rel="L803">shall keep mine to swell my song.”</li>
<li class="L804" rel="L804"></li>
<li class="L805" rel="L805">Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song</li>
<li class="L806" rel="L806">or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that</li>
<li class="L807" rel="L807">she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her</li>
<li class="L808" rel="L808">sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in</li>
<li class="L809" rel="L809">the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always</li>
<li class="L810" rel="L810">impatient for display.</li>
<li class="L811" rel="L811"></li>
<li class="L812" rel="L812">Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her</li>
<li class="L813" rel="L813">application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited</li>
<li class="L814" rel="L814">manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she</li>
<li class="L815" rel="L815">had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with</li>
<li class="L816" rel="L816">much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the</li>
<li class="L817" rel="L817">end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by</li>
<li class="L818" rel="L818">Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who,</li>
<li class="L819" rel="L819">with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in</li>
<li class="L820" rel="L820">dancing at one end of the room.</li>
<li class="L821" rel="L821"></li>
<li class="L822" rel="L822">Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of</li>
<li class="L823" rel="L823">passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too</li>
<li class="L824" rel="L824">much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was</li>
<li class="L825" rel="L825">his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:</li>
<li class="L826" rel="L826"></li>
<li class="L827" rel="L827">“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There</li>
<li class="L828" rel="L828">is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first</li>
<li class="L829" rel="L829">refinements of polished society.”</li>
<li class="L830" rel="L830"></li>
<li class="L831" rel="L831">“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst</li>
<li class="L832" rel="L832">the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance.”</li>
<li class="L833" rel="L833"></li>
<li class="L834" rel="L834">Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he</li>
<li class="L835" rel="L835">continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt</li>
<li class="L836" rel="L836">not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”</li>
<li class="L837" rel="L837"></li>
<li class="L838" rel="L838">“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”</li>
<li class="L839" rel="L839"></li>
<li class="L840" rel="L840">“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do</li>
<li class="L841" rel="L841">you often dance at St. James&#39;s?”</li>
<li class="L842" rel="L842"></li>
<li class="L843" rel="L843">“Never, sir.”</li>
<li class="L844" rel="L844"></li>
<li class="L845" rel="L845">“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”</li>
<li class="L846" rel="L846"></li>
<li class="L847" rel="L847">“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”</li>
<li class="L848" rel="L848"></li>
<li class="L849" rel="L849">“You have a house in town, I conclude?”</li>
<li class="L850" rel="L850"></li>
<li class="L851" rel="L851">Mr. Darcy bowed.</li>
<li class="L852" rel="L852"></li>
<li class="L853" rel="L853">“I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself--for I am fond</li>
<li class="L854" rel="L854">of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of</li>
<li class="L855" rel="L855">London would agree with Lady Lucas.”</li>
<li class="L856" rel="L856"></li>
<li class="L857" rel="L857">He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed</li>
<li class="L858" rel="L858">to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was</li>
<li class="L859" rel="L859">struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to</li>
<li class="L860" rel="L860">her:</li>
<li class="L861" rel="L861"></li>
<li class="L862" rel="L862">“My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow</li>
<li class="L863" rel="L863">me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You</li>
<li class="L864" rel="L864">cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.”</li>
<li class="L865" rel="L865"> And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though</li>
<li class="L866" rel="L866">extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly</li>
<li class="L867" rel="L867">drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William:</li>
<li class="L868" rel="L868"></li>
<li class="L869" rel="L869">“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you</li>
<li class="L870" rel="L870">not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”</li>
<li class="L871" rel="L871"></li>
<li class="L872" rel="L872">Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of</li>
<li class="L873" rel="L873">her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at</li>
<li class="L874" rel="L874">all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.</li>
<li class="L875" rel="L875"></li>
<li class="L876" rel="L876">“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny</li>
<li class="L877" rel="L877">me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the</li>
<li class="L878" rel="L878">amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us</li>
<li class="L879" rel="L879">for one half-hour.”</li>
<li class="L880" rel="L880"></li>
<li class="L881" rel="L881">“Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.</li>
<li class="L882" rel="L882"></li>
<li class="L883" rel="L883">“He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza,</li>
<li class="L884" rel="L884">we cannot wonder at his complaisance--for who would object to such a</li>
<li class="L885" rel="L885">partner?”</li>
<li class="L886" rel="L886"></li>
<li class="L887" rel="L887">Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not</li>
<li class="L888" rel="L888">injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some</li>
<li class="L889" rel="L889">complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:</li>
<li class="L890" rel="L890"></li>
<li class="L891" rel="L891">“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”</li>
<li class="L892" rel="L892"></li>
<li class="L893" rel="L893">“I should imagine not.”</li>
<li class="L894" rel="L894"></li>
<li class="L895" rel="L895">“You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings</li>
<li class="L896" rel="L896">in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.</li>
<li class="L897" rel="L897">I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise--the</li>
<li class="L898" rel="L898">nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would</li>
<li class="L899" rel="L899">I give to hear your strictures on them!”</li>
<li class="L900" rel="L900"></li>
<li class="L901" rel="L901">“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more</li>
<li class="L902" rel="L902">agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure</li>
<li class="L903" rel="L903">which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”</li>
<li class="L904" rel="L904"></li>
<li class="L905" rel="L905">Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he</li>
<li class="L906" rel="L906">would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.</li>
<li class="L907" rel="L907">Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:</li>
<li class="L908" rel="L908"></li>
<li class="L909" rel="L909">“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”</li>
<li class="L910" rel="L910"></li>
<li class="L911" rel="L911">“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all astonishment.</li>
<li class="L912" rel="L912">How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray, when am I to wish you</li>
<li class="L913" rel="L913">joy?”</li>
<li class="L914" rel="L914"></li>
<li class="L915" rel="L915">“That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady&#39;s</li>
<li class="L916" rel="L916">imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love</li>
<li class="L917" rel="L917">to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.”</li>
<li class="L918" rel="L918"></li>
<li class="L919" rel="L919">“Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is</li>
<li class="L920" rel="L920">absolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed;</li>
<li class="L921" rel="L921">and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you.”</li>
<li class="L922" rel="L922"></li>
<li class="L923" rel="L923">He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to</li>
<li class="L924" rel="L924">entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her</li>
<li class="L925" rel="L925">that all was safe, her wit flowed long.</li>
<li class="L926" rel="L926"></li>
<li class="L927" rel="L927"></li>
<li class="L928" rel="L928"></li>
<li class="L929" rel="L929">Chapter 7</li>
<li class="L930" rel="L930"></li>
<li class="L931" rel="L931"></li>
<li class="L932" rel="L932">Mr. Bennet&#39;s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two</li>
<li class="L933" rel="L933">thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,</li>
<li class="L934" rel="L934">in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother&#39;s</li>
<li class="L935" rel="L935">fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply</li>
<li class="L936" rel="L936">the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and</li>
<li class="L937" rel="L937">had left her four thousand pounds.</li>
<li class="L938" rel="L938"></li>
<li class="L939" rel="L939">She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to</li>
<li class="L940" rel="L940">their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in</li>
<li class="L941" rel="L941">London in a respectable line of trade.</li>
<li class="L942" rel="L942"></li>
<li class="L943" rel="L943">The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most</li>
<li class="L944" rel="L944">convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted</li>
<li class="L945" rel="L945">thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and</li>
<li class="L946" rel="L946">to a milliner&#39;s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,</li>
<li class="L947" rel="L947">Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;</li>
<li class="L948" rel="L948">their minds were more vacant than their sisters&#39;, and when nothing</li>
<li class="L949" rel="L949">better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning</li>
<li class="L950" rel="L950">hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news</li>
<li class="L951" rel="L951">the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some</li>
<li class="L952" rel="L952">from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with</li>
<li class="L953" rel="L953">news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the</li>
<li class="L954" rel="L954">neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the</li>
<li class="L955" rel="L955">headquarters.</li>
<li class="L956" rel="L956"></li>
<li class="L957" rel="L957">Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most</li>
<li class="L958" rel="L958">interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge</li>
<li class="L959" rel="L959">of the officers&#39; names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a</li>
<li class="L960" rel="L960">secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr.</li>
<li class="L961" rel="L961">Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of</li>
<li class="L962" rel="L962">felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and</li>
<li class="L963" rel="L963">Mr. Bingley&#39;s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation</li>
<li class="L964" rel="L964">to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the</li>
<li class="L965" rel="L965">regimentals of an ensign.</li>
<li class="L966" rel="L966"></li>
<li class="L967" rel="L967">After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.</li>
<li class="L968" rel="L968">Bennet coolly observed:</li>
<li class="L969" rel="L969"></li>
<li class="L970" rel="L970">“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two</li>
<li class="L971" rel="L971">of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but</li>
<li class="L972" rel="L972">I am now convinced.”</li>
<li class="L973" rel="L973"></li>
<li class="L974" rel="L974">Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect</li>
<li class="L975" rel="L975">indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter,</li>
<li class="L976" rel="L976">and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the</li>
<li class="L977" rel="L977">next morning to London.</li>
<li class="L978" rel="L978"></li>
<li class="L979" rel="L979">“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so</li>
<li class="L980" rel="L980">ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly</li>
<li class="L981" rel="L981">of anybody&#39;s children, it should not be of my own, however.”</li>
<li class="L982" rel="L982"></li>
<li class="L983" rel="L983">“If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”</li>
<li class="L984" rel="L984"></li>
<li class="L985" rel="L985">“Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”</li>
<li class="L986" rel="L986"></li>
<li class="L987" rel="L987">“This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I</li>
<li class="L988" rel="L988">had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must</li>
<li class="L989" rel="L989">so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly</li>
<li class="L990" rel="L990">foolish.”</li>
<li class="L991" rel="L991"></li>
<li class="L992" rel="L992">“My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of</li>
<li class="L993" rel="L993">their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will</li>
<li class="L994" rel="L994">not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when</li>
<li class="L995" rel="L995">I liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my</li>
<li class="L996" rel="L996">heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,</li>
<li class="L997" rel="L997">should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought</li>
<li class="L998" rel="L998">Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William&#39;s in</li>
<li class="L999" rel="L999">his regimentals.”</li>
<li class="L1000" rel="L1000"></li>
<li class="L1001" rel="L1001">“Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain</li>
<li class="L1002" rel="L1002">Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson&#39;s as they did when they first</li>
<li class="L1003" rel="L1003">came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke&#39;s library.”</li>
<li class="L1004" rel="L1004"></li>
<li class="L1005" rel="L1005">Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with</li>
<li class="L1006" rel="L1006">a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited</li>
<li class="L1007" rel="L1007">for an answer. Mrs. Bennet&#39;s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was</li>
<li class="L1008" rel="L1008">eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,</li>
<li class="L1009" rel="L1009"></li>
<li class="L1010" rel="L1010">“Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,</li>
<li class="L1011" rel="L1011">Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”</li>
<li class="L1012" rel="L1012"></li>
<li class="L1013" rel="L1013">“It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.</li>
<li class="L1014" rel="L1014"></li>
<li class="L1015" rel="L1015">“MY DEAR FRIEND,--</li>
<li class="L1016" rel="L1016"></li>
<li class="L1017" rel="L1017">“If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me,</li>
<li class="L1018" rel="L1018">we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives,</li>
<li class="L1019" rel="L1019">for a whole day&#39;s tete-a-tete between two women can never end without a</li>
<li class="L1020" rel="L1020">quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the</li>
<li class="L1021" rel="L1021">gentlemen are to dine with the officers.--Yours ever,</li>
<li class="L1022" rel="L1022"></li>
<li class="L1023" rel="L1023">“CAROLINE BINGLEY”</li>
<li class="L1024" rel="L1024"></li>
<li class="L1025" rel="L1025">“With the officers!” cried Lydia. “I wonder my aunt did not tell us of</li>
<li class="L1026" rel="L1026">_that_.”</li>
<li class="L1027" rel="L1027"></li>
<li class="L1028" rel="L1028">“Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that is very unlucky.”</li>
<li class="L1029" rel="L1029"></li>
<li class="L1030" rel="L1030">“Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.</li>
<li class="L1031" rel="L1031"></li>
<li class="L1032" rel="L1032">“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to</li>
<li class="L1033" rel="L1033">rain; and then you must stay all night.”</li>
<li class="L1034" rel="L1034"></li>
<li class="L1035" rel="L1035">“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that</li>
<li class="L1036" rel="L1036">they would not offer to send her home.”</li>
<li class="L1037" rel="L1037"></li>
<li class="L1038" rel="L1038">“Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley&#39;s chaise to go to Meryton,</li>
<li class="L1039" rel="L1039">and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”</li>
<li class="L1040" rel="L1040"></li>
<li class="L1041" rel="L1041">“I had much rather go in the coach.”</li>
<li class="L1042" rel="L1042"></li>
<li class="L1043" rel="L1043">“But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are</li>
<li class="L1044" rel="L1044">wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?”</li>
<li class="L1045" rel="L1045"></li>
<li class="L1046" rel="L1046">“They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”</li>
<li class="L1047" rel="L1047"></li>
<li class="L1048" rel="L1048">“But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother&#39;s purpose</li>
<li class="L1049" rel="L1049">will be answered.”</li>
<li class="L1050" rel="L1050"></li>
<li class="L1051" rel="L1051">She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses</li>
<li class="L1052" rel="L1052">were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her</li>
<li class="L1053" rel="L1053">mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a</li>
<li class="L1054" rel="L1054">bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before</li>
<li class="L1055" rel="L1055">it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was</li>
<li class="L1056" rel="L1056">delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;</li>
<li class="L1057" rel="L1057">Jane certainly could not come back.</li>
<li class="L1058" rel="L1058"></li>
<li class="L1059" rel="L1059">“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet more than</li>
<li class="L1060" rel="L1060">once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the</li>
<li class="L1061" rel="L1061">next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her</li>
<li class="L1062" rel="L1062">contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield</li>
<li class="L1063" rel="L1063">brought the following note for Elizabeth:</li>
<li class="L1064" rel="L1064"></li>
<li class="L1065" rel="L1065">“MY DEAREST LIZZY,--</li>
<li class="L1066" rel="L1066"></li>
<li class="L1067" rel="L1067">“I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be</li>
<li class="L1068" rel="L1068">imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not</li>
<li class="L1069" rel="L1069">hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr.</li>
<li class="L1070" rel="L1070">Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been</li>
<li class="L1071" rel="L1071">to me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the</li>
<li class="L1072" rel="L1072">matter with me.--Yours, etc.”</li>
<li class="L1073" rel="L1073"></li>
<li class="L1074" rel="L1074">“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note</li>
<li class="L1075" rel="L1075">aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she</li>
<li class="L1076" rel="L1076">should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of</li>
<li class="L1077" rel="L1077">Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”</li>
<li class="L1078" rel="L1078"></li>
<li class="L1079" rel="L1079">“Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling</li>
<li class="L1080" rel="L1080">colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is</li>
<li class="L1081" rel="L1081">all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.”</li>
<li class="L1082" rel="L1082"></li>
<li class="L1083" rel="L1083">Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though</li>
<li class="L1084" rel="L1084">the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking</li>
<li class="L1085" rel="L1085">was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.</li>
<li class="L1086" rel="L1086"></li>
<li class="L1087" rel="L1087">“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a</li>
<li class="L1088" rel="L1088">thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get</li>
<li class="L1089" rel="L1089">there.”</li>
<li class="L1090" rel="L1090"></li>
<li class="L1091" rel="L1091">“I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.”</li>
<li class="L1092" rel="L1092"></li>
<li class="L1093" rel="L1093">“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the</li>
<li class="L1094" rel="L1094">horses?”</li>
<li class="L1095" rel="L1095"></li>
<li class="L1096" rel="L1096">“No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing</li>
<li class="L1097" rel="L1097">when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.”</li>
<li class="L1098" rel="L1098"></li>
<li class="L1099" rel="L1099">“I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every</li>
<li class="L1100" rel="L1100">impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,</li>
<li class="L1101" rel="L1101">exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”</li>
<li class="L1102" rel="L1102"></li>
<li class="L1103" rel="L1103">“We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.</li>
<li class="L1104" rel="L1104">Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off</li>
<li class="L1105" rel="L1105">together.</li>
<li class="L1106" rel="L1106"></li>
<li class="L1107" rel="L1107">“If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may</li>
<li class="L1108" rel="L1108">see something of Captain Carter before he goes.”</li>
<li class="L1109" rel="L1109"></li>
<li class="L1110" rel="L1110">In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one</li>
<li class="L1111" rel="L1111">of the officers&#39; wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing</li>
<li class="L1112" rel="L1112">field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing</li>
<li class="L1113" rel="L1113">over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last</li>
<li class="L1114" rel="L1114">within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face</li>
<li class="L1115" rel="L1115">glowing with the warmth of exercise.</li>
<li class="L1116" rel="L1116"></li>
<li class="L1117" rel="L1117">She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were</li>
<li class="L1118" rel="L1118">assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.</li>
<li class="L1119" rel="L1119">That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such</li>
<li class="L1120" rel="L1120">dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and</li>
<li class="L1121" rel="L1121">Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt</li>
<li class="L1122" rel="L1122">for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their</li>
<li class="L1123" rel="L1123">brother&#39;s manners there was something better than politeness; there</li>
<li class="L1124" rel="L1124">was good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.</li>
<li class="L1125" rel="L1125">Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the</li>
<li class="L1126" rel="L1126">brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as</li>
<li class="L1127" rel="L1127">to the occasion&#39;s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was</li>
<li class="L1128" rel="L1128">thinking only of his breakfast.</li>
<li class="L1129" rel="L1129"></li>
<li class="L1130" rel="L1130">Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss</li>
<li class="L1131" rel="L1131">Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not</li>
<li class="L1132" rel="L1132">well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her</li>
<li class="L1133" rel="L1133">immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving</li>
<li class="L1134" rel="L1134">alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed</li>
<li class="L1135" rel="L1135">for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,</li>
<li class="L1136" rel="L1136">however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them</li>
<li class="L1137" rel="L1137">together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the</li>
<li class="L1138" rel="L1138">extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended</li>
<li class="L1139" rel="L1139">her.</li>
<li class="L1140" rel="L1140"></li>
<li class="L1141" rel="L1141">When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth</li>
<li class="L1142" rel="L1142">began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and</li>
<li class="L1143" rel="L1143">solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having</li>
<li class="L1144" rel="L1144">examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught</li>
<li class="L1145" rel="L1145">a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;</li>
<li class="L1146" rel="L1146">advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice</li>
<li class="L1147" rel="L1147">was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head</li>
<li class="L1148" rel="L1148">ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were</li>
<li class="L1149" rel="L1149">the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in</li>
<li class="L1150" rel="L1150">fact, nothing to do elsewhere.</li>
<li class="L1151" rel="L1151"></li>
<li class="L1152" rel="L1152">When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very</li>
<li class="L1153" rel="L1153">unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only</li>
<li class="L1154" rel="L1154">wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern</li>
<li class="L1155" rel="L1155">in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer</li>
<li class="L1156" rel="L1156">of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.</li>
<li class="L1157" rel="L1157">Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to</li>
<li class="L1158" rel="L1158">Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply</li>
<li class="L1159" rel="L1159">of clothes.</li>
<li class="L1160" rel="L1160"></li>
<li class="L1161" rel="L1161"></li>
<li class="L1162" rel="L1162"></li>
<li class="L1163" rel="L1163">Chapter 8</li>
<li class="L1164" rel="L1164"></li>
<li class="L1165" rel="L1165"></li>
<li class="L1166" rel="L1166">At five o&#39;clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six</li>
<li class="L1167" rel="L1167">Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then</li>
<li class="L1168" rel="L1168">poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the</li>
<li class="L1169" rel="L1169">much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley&#39;s, she could not make a very</li>
<li class="L1170" rel="L1170">favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing</li>
<li class="L1171" rel="L1171">this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how</li>
<li class="L1172" rel="L1172">shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked</li>
<li class="L1173" rel="L1173">being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their</li>
<li class="L1174" rel="L1174">indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored</li>
<li class="L1175" rel="L1175">Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.</li>
<li class="L1176" rel="L1176"></li>
<li class="L1177" rel="L1177">Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could</li>
<li class="L1178" rel="L1178">regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his</li>
<li class="L1179" rel="L1179">attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling</li>
<li class="L1180" rel="L1180">herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the</li>
<li class="L1181" rel="L1181">others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was</li>
<li class="L1182" rel="L1182">engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.</li>
<li class="L1183" rel="L1183">Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to</li>
<li class="L1184" rel="L1184">eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain</li>
<li class="L1185" rel="L1185">dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.</li>
<li class="L1186" rel="L1186"></li>
<li class="L1187" rel="L1187">When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley</li>
<li class="L1188" rel="L1188">began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were</li>
<li class="L1189" rel="L1189">pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;</li>
<li class="L1190" rel="L1190">she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the</li>
<li class="L1191" rel="L1191">same, and added:</li>
<li class="L1192" rel="L1192"></li>
<li class="L1193" rel="L1193">“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent</li>
<li class="L1194" rel="L1194">walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really</li>
<li class="L1195" rel="L1195">looked almost wild.”</li>
<li class="L1196" rel="L1196"></li>
<li class="L1197" rel="L1197">“She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very</li>
<li class="L1198" rel="L1198">nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the</li>
<li class="L1199" rel="L1199">country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!”</li>
<li class="L1200" rel="L1200"></li>
<li class="L1201" rel="L1201">“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep</li>
<li class="L1202" rel="L1202">in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to</li>
<li class="L1203" rel="L1203">hide it not doing its office.”</li>
<li class="L1204" rel="L1204"></li>
<li class="L1205" rel="L1205">“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was</li>
<li class="L1206" rel="L1206">all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably</li>
<li class="L1207" rel="L1207">well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite</li>
<li class="L1208" rel="L1208">escaped my notice.”</li>
<li class="L1209" rel="L1209"></li>
<li class="L1210" rel="L1210">“_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am</li>
<li class="L1211" rel="L1211">inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your_ sister make such</li>
<li class="L1212" rel="L1212">an exhibition.”</li>
<li class="L1213" rel="L1213"></li>
<li class="L1214" rel="L1214">“Certainly not.”</li>
<li class="L1215" rel="L1215"></li>
<li class="L1216" rel="L1216">“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,</li>
<li class="L1217" rel="L1217">above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by</li>
<li class="L1218" rel="L1218">it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,</li>
<li class="L1219" rel="L1219">a most country-town indifference to decorum.”</li>
<li class="L1220" rel="L1220"></li>
<li class="L1221" rel="L1221">“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said</li>
<li class="L1222" rel="L1222">Bingley.</li>
<li class="L1223" rel="L1223"></li>
<li class="L1224" rel="L1224">“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, “that</li>
<li class="L1225" rel="L1225">this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.”</li>
<li class="L1226" rel="L1226"></li>
<li class="L1227" rel="L1227">“Not at all,” he replied; “they were brightened by the exercise.” A</li>
<li class="L1228" rel="L1228">short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:</li>
<li class="L1229" rel="L1229"></li>
<li class="L1230" rel="L1230">“I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very</li>
<li class="L1231" rel="L1231">sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with</li>
<li class="L1232" rel="L1232">such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is</li>
<li class="L1233" rel="L1233">no chance of it.”</li>
<li class="L1234" rel="L1234"></li>
<li class="L1235" rel="L1235">“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in</li>
<li class="L1236" rel="L1236">Meryton.”</li>
<li class="L1237" rel="L1237"></li>
<li class="L1238" rel="L1238">“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”</li>
<li class="L1239" rel="L1239"></li>
<li class="L1240" rel="L1240">“That is capital,” added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.</li>
<li class="L1241" rel="L1241"></li>
<li class="L1242" rel="L1242">“If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it</li>
<li class="L1243" rel="L1243">would not make them one jot less agreeable.”</li>
<li class="L1244" rel="L1244"></li>
<li class="L1245" rel="L1245">“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any</li>
<li class="L1246" rel="L1246">consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.</li>
<li class="L1247" rel="L1247"></li>
<li class="L1248" rel="L1248">To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their</li>
<li class="L1249" rel="L1249">hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of</li>
<li class="L1250" rel="L1250">their dear friend&#39;s vulgar relations.</li>
<li class="L1251" rel="L1251"></li>
<li class="L1252" rel="L1252">With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on</li>
<li class="L1253" rel="L1253">leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.</li>
<li class="L1254" rel="L1254">She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till</li>
<li class="L1255" rel="L1255">late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and</li>
<li class="L1256" rel="L1256">when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go</li>
<li class="L1257" rel="L1257">downstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole</li>
<li class="L1258" rel="L1258">party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting</li>
<li class="L1259" rel="L1259">them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the</li>
<li class="L1260" rel="L1260">excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay</li>
<li class="L1261" rel="L1261">below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.</li>
<li class="L1262" rel="L1262"></li>
<li class="L1263" rel="L1263">“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”</li>
<li class="L1264" rel="L1264"></li>
<li class="L1265" rel="L1265">“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great</li>
<li class="L1266" rel="L1266">reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”</li>
<li class="L1267" rel="L1267"></li>
<li class="L1268" rel="L1268">“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I am</li>
<li class="L1269" rel="L1269">_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”</li>
<li class="L1270" rel="L1270"></li>
<li class="L1271" rel="L1271">“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and</li>
<li class="L1272" rel="L1272">I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.”</li>
<li class="L1273" rel="L1273"></li>
<li class="L1274" rel="L1274">Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the</li>
<li class="L1275" rel="L1275">table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her</li>
<li class="L1276" rel="L1276">others--all that his library afforded.</li>
<li class="L1277" rel="L1277"></li>
<li class="L1278" rel="L1278">“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own</li>
<li class="L1279" rel="L1279">credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more</li>
<li class="L1280" rel="L1280">than I ever looked into.”</li>
<li class="L1281" rel="L1281"></li>
<li class="L1282" rel="L1282">Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those</li>
<li class="L1283" rel="L1283">in the room.</li>
<li class="L1284" rel="L1284"></li>
<li class="L1285" rel="L1285">“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left</li>
<li class="L1286" rel="L1286">so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at</li>
<li class="L1287" rel="L1287">Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”</li>
<li class="L1288" rel="L1288"></li>
<li class="L1289" rel="L1289">“It ought to be good,” he replied, “it has been the work of many</li>
<li class="L1290" rel="L1290">generations.”</li>
<li class="L1291" rel="L1291"></li>
<li class="L1292" rel="L1292">“And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying</li>
<li class="L1293" rel="L1293">books.”</li>
<li class="L1294" rel="L1294"></li>
<li class="L1295" rel="L1295">“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as</li>
<li class="L1296" rel="L1296">these.”</li>
<li class="L1297" rel="L1297"></li>
<li class="L1298" rel="L1298">“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of</li>
<li class="L1299" rel="L1299">that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be</li>
<li class="L1300" rel="L1300">half as delightful as Pemberley.”</li>
<li class="L1301" rel="L1301"></li>
<li class="L1302" rel="L1302">“I wish it may.”</li>
<li class="L1303" rel="L1303"></li>
<li class="L1304" rel="L1304">“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that</li>
<li class="L1305" rel="L1305">neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a</li>
<li class="L1306" rel="L1306">finer county in England than Derbyshire.”</li>
<li class="L1307" rel="L1307"></li>
<li class="L1308" rel="L1308">“With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.”</li>
<li class="L1309" rel="L1309"></li>
<li class="L1310" rel="L1310">“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”</li>
<li class="L1311" rel="L1311"></li>
<li class="L1312" rel="L1312">“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get</li>
<li class="L1313" rel="L1313">Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”</li>
<li class="L1314" rel="L1314"></li>
<li class="L1315" rel="L1315">Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very</li>
<li class="L1316" rel="L1316">little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew</li>
<li class="L1317" rel="L1317">near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his</li>
<li class="L1318" rel="L1318">eldest sister, to observe the game.</li>
<li class="L1319" rel="L1319"></li>
<li class="L1320" rel="L1320">“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley; “will</li>
<li class="L1321" rel="L1321">she be as tall as I am?”</li>
<li class="L1322" rel="L1322"></li>
<li class="L1323" rel="L1323">“I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet&#39;s height, or</li>
<li class="L1324" rel="L1324">rather taller.”</li>
<li class="L1325" rel="L1325"></li>
<li class="L1326" rel="L1326">“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me</li>
<li class="L1327" rel="L1327">so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished</li>
<li class="L1328" rel="L1328">for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”</li>
<li class="L1329" rel="L1329"></li>
<li class="L1330" rel="L1330">“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience</li>
<li class="L1331" rel="L1331">to be so very accomplished as they all are.”</li>
<li class="L1332" rel="L1332"></li>
<li class="L1333" rel="L1333">“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”</li>
<li class="L1334" rel="L1334"></li>
<li class="L1335" rel="L1335">“Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and</li>
<li class="L1336" rel="L1336">net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure</li>
<li class="L1337" rel="L1337">I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being</li>
<li class="L1338" rel="L1338">informed that she was very accomplished.”</li>
<li class="L1339" rel="L1339"></li>
<li class="L1340" rel="L1340">“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has</li>
<li class="L1341" rel="L1341">too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no</li>
<li class="L1342" rel="L1342">otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very</li>
<li class="L1343" rel="L1343">far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I</li>
<li class="L1344" rel="L1344">cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my</li>
<li class="L1345" rel="L1345">acquaintance, that are really accomplished.”</li>
<li class="L1346" rel="L1346"></li>
<li class="L1347" rel="L1347">“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.</li>
<li class="L1348" rel="L1348"></li>
<li class="L1349" rel="L1349">“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your</li>
<li class="L1350" rel="L1350">idea of an accomplished woman.”</li>
<li class="L1351" rel="L1351"></li>
<li class="L1352" rel="L1352">“Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.”</li>
<li class="L1353" rel="L1353"></li>
<li class="L1354" rel="L1354">“Oh! certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really</li>
<li class="L1355" rel="L1355">esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met</li>
<li class="L1356" rel="L1356">with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,</li>
<li class="L1357" rel="L1357">dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides</li>
<li class="L1358" rel="L1358">all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of</li>
<li class="L1359" rel="L1359">walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word</li>
<li class="L1360" rel="L1360">will be but half-deserved.”</li>
<li class="L1361" rel="L1361"></li>
<li class="L1362" rel="L1362">“All this she must possess,” added Darcy, “and to all this she must</li>
<li class="L1363" rel="L1363">yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by</li>
<li class="L1364" rel="L1364">extensive reading.”</li>
<li class="L1365" rel="L1365"></li>
<li class="L1366" rel="L1366">“I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.</li>
<li class="L1367" rel="L1367">I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”</li>
<li class="L1368" rel="L1368"></li>
<li class="L1369" rel="L1369">“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all</li>
<li class="L1370" rel="L1370">this?”</li>
<li class="L1371" rel="L1371"></li>
<li class="L1372" rel="L1372">“I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and</li>
<li class="L1373" rel="L1373">application, and elegance, as you describe united.”</li>
<li class="L1374" rel="L1374"></li>
<li class="L1375" rel="L1375">Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her</li>
<li class="L1376" rel="L1376">implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who</li>
<li class="L1377" rel="L1377">answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with</li>
<li class="L1378" rel="L1378">bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all</li>
<li class="L1379" rel="L1379">conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the</li>
<li class="L1380" rel="L1380">room.</li>
<li class="L1381" rel="L1381"></li>
<li class="L1382" rel="L1382">“Elizabeth Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,</li>
<li class="L1383" rel="L1383">“is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the</li>
<li class="L1384" rel="L1384">other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it</li>
<li class="L1385" rel="L1385">succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”</li>
<li class="L1386" rel="L1386"></li>
<li class="L1387" rel="L1387">“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,</li>
<li class="L1388" rel="L1388">“there is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend</li>
<li class="L1389" rel="L1389">to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is</li>
<li class="L1390" rel="L1390">despicable.”</li>
<li class="L1391" rel="L1391"></li>
<li class="L1392" rel="L1392">Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to</li>
<li class="L1393" rel="L1393">continue the subject.</li>
<li class="L1394" rel="L1394"></li>
<li class="L1395" rel="L1395">Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and</li>
<li class="L1396" rel="L1396">that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for</li>
<li class="L1397" rel="L1397">immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could</li>
<li class="L1398" rel="L1398">be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most</li>
<li class="L1399" rel="L1399">eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so</li>
<li class="L1400" rel="L1400">unwilling to comply with their brother&#39;s proposal; and it was settled</li>
<li class="L1401" rel="L1401">that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet</li>
<li class="L1402" rel="L1402">were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters</li>
<li class="L1403" rel="L1403">declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,</li>
<li class="L1404" rel="L1404">however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief</li>
<li class="L1405" rel="L1405">to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every</li>
<li class="L1406" rel="L1406">attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.</li>
<li class="L1407" rel="L1407"></li>
<li class="L1408" rel="L1408"></li>
<li class="L1409" rel="L1409"></li>
<li class="L1410" rel="L1410">Chapter 9</li>
<li class="L1411" rel="L1411"></li>
<li class="L1412" rel="L1412"></li>
<li class="L1413" rel="L1413">Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister&#39;s room, and in the</li>
<li class="L1414" rel="L1414">morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the</li>
<li class="L1415" rel="L1415">inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,</li>
<li class="L1416" rel="L1416">and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his</li>
<li class="L1417" rel="L1417">sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a</li>
<li class="L1418" rel="L1418">note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her</li>
<li class="L1419" rel="L1419">own judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and</li>
<li class="L1420" rel="L1420">its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her</li>
<li class="L1421" rel="L1421">two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.</li>
<li class="L1422" rel="L1422"></li>
<li class="L1423" rel="L1423">Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been</li>
<li class="L1424" rel="L1424">very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was</li>
<li class="L1425" rel="L1425">not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her</li>
<li class="L1426" rel="L1426">restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She</li>
<li class="L1427" rel="L1427">would not listen, therefore, to her daughter&#39;s proposal of being carried</li>
<li class="L1428" rel="L1428">home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think</li>
<li class="L1429" rel="L1429">it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss</li>
<li class="L1430" rel="L1430">Bingley&#39;s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all</li>
<li class="L1431" rel="L1431">attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes</li>
<li class="L1432" rel="L1432">that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.</li>
<li class="L1433" rel="L1433"></li>
<li class="L1434" rel="L1434">“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be</li>
<li class="L1435" rel="L1435">moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass</li>
<li class="L1436" rel="L1436">a little longer on your kindness.”</li>
<li class="L1437" rel="L1437"></li>
<li class="L1438" rel="L1438">“Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I am</li>
<li class="L1439" rel="L1439">sure, will not hear of her removal.”</li>
<li class="L1440" rel="L1440"></li>
<li class="L1441" rel="L1441">“You may depend upon it, Madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,</li>
<li class="L1442" rel="L1442">“that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she</li>
<li class="L1443" rel="L1443">remains with us.”</li>
<li class="L1444" rel="L1444"></li>
<li class="L1445" rel="L1445">Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.</li>
<li class="L1446" rel="L1446"></li>
<li class="L1447" rel="L1447">“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends I do not</li>
<li class="L1448" rel="L1448">know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers</li>
<li class="L1449" rel="L1449">a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is</li>
<li class="L1450" rel="L1450">always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest</li>
<li class="L1451" rel="L1451">temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are</li>
<li class="L1452" rel="L1452">nothing to _her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a</li>
<li class="L1453" rel="L1453">charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the</li>
<li class="L1454" rel="L1454">country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it</li>
<li class="L1455" rel="L1455">in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.”</li>
<li class="L1456" rel="L1456"></li>
<li class="L1457" rel="L1457">“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I</li>
<li class="L1458" rel="L1458">should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five</li>
<li class="L1459" rel="L1459">minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”</li>
<li class="L1460" rel="L1460"></li>
<li class="L1461" rel="L1461">“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.</li>
<li class="L1462" rel="L1462"></li>
<li class="L1463" rel="L1463">“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.</li>
<li class="L1464" rel="L1464"></li>
<li class="L1465" rel="L1465">“Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly.”</li>
<li class="L1466" rel="L1466"></li>
<li class="L1467" rel="L1467">“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen</li>
<li class="L1468" rel="L1468">through I am afraid is pitiful.”</li>
<li class="L1469" rel="L1469"></li>
<li class="L1470" rel="L1470">“That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate</li>
<li class="L1471" rel="L1471">character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”</li>
<li class="L1472" rel="L1472"></li>
<li class="L1473" rel="L1473">“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in</li>
<li class="L1474" rel="L1474">the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”</li>
<li class="L1475" rel="L1475"></li>
<li class="L1476" rel="L1476">“I did not know before,” continued Bingley immediately, “that you were a</li>
<li class="L1477" rel="L1477">studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”</li>
<li class="L1478" rel="L1478"></li>
<li class="L1479" rel="L1479">“Yes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at</li>
<li class="L1480" rel="L1480">least that advantage.”</li>
<li class="L1481" rel="L1481"></li>
<li class="L1482" rel="L1482">“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but a few subjects for</li>
<li class="L1483" rel="L1483">such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and</li>
<li class="L1484" rel="L1484">unvarying society.”</li>
<li class="L1485" rel="L1485"></li>
<li class="L1486" rel="L1486">“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be</li>
<li class="L1487" rel="L1487">observed in them for ever.”</li>
<li class="L1488" rel="L1488"></li>
<li class="L1489" rel="L1489">“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning</li>
<li class="L1490" rel="L1490">a country neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of _that_</li>
<li class="L1491" rel="L1491">going on in the country as in town.”</li>
<li class="L1492" rel="L1492"></li>
<li class="L1493" rel="L1493">Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,</li>
<li class="L1494" rel="L1494">turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete</li>
<li class="L1495" rel="L1495">victory over him, continued her triumph.</li>
<li class="L1496" rel="L1496"></li>
<li class="L1497" rel="L1497">“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for</li>
<li class="L1498" rel="L1498">my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal</li>
<li class="L1499" rel="L1499">pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?”</li>
<li class="L1500" rel="L1500"></li>
<li class="L1501" rel="L1501">“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it;</li>
<li class="L1502" rel="L1502">and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their</li>
<li class="L1503" rel="L1503">advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”</li>
<li class="L1504" rel="L1504"></li>
<li class="L1505" rel="L1505">“Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But that</li>
<li class="L1506" rel="L1506">gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing</li>
<li class="L1507" rel="L1507">at all.”</li>
<li class="L1508" rel="L1508"></li>
<li class="L1509" rel="L1509">“Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her</li>
<li class="L1510" rel="L1510">mother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not</li>
<li class="L1511" rel="L1511">such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,</li>
<li class="L1512" rel="L1512">which you must acknowledge to be true.”</li>
<li class="L1513" rel="L1513"></li>
<li class="L1514" rel="L1514">“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting</li>
<li class="L1515" rel="L1515">with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few</li>
<li class="L1516" rel="L1516">neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”</li>
<li class="L1517" rel="L1517"></li>
<li class="L1518" rel="L1518">Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his</li>
<li class="L1519" rel="L1519">countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards</li>
<li class="L1520" rel="L1520">Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of</li>
<li class="L1521" rel="L1521">saying something that might turn her mother&#39;s thoughts, now asked her if</li>
<li class="L1522" rel="L1522">Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.</li>
<li class="L1523" rel="L1523"></li>
<li class="L1524" rel="L1524">“Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir</li>
<li class="L1525" rel="L1525">William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So</li>
<li class="L1526" rel="L1526">genteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_</li>
<li class="L1527" rel="L1527">is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very</li>
<li class="L1528" rel="L1528">important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.”</li>
<li class="L1529" rel="L1529"></li>
<li class="L1530" rel="L1530">“Did Charlotte dine with you?”</li>
<li class="L1531" rel="L1531"></li>
<li class="L1532" rel="L1532">“No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For</li>
<li class="L1533" rel="L1533">my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work;</li>
<li class="L1534" rel="L1534">_my_ daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to</li>
<li class="L1535" rel="L1535">judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls,</li>
<li class="L1536" rel="L1536">I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think</li>
<li class="L1537" rel="L1537">Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend.”</li>
<li class="L1538" rel="L1538"></li>
<li class="L1539" rel="L1539">“She seems a very pleasant young woman.”</li>
<li class="L1540" rel="L1540"></li>
<li class="L1541" rel="L1541">“Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself</li>
<li class="L1542" rel="L1542">has often said so, and envied me Jane&#39;s beauty. I do not like to boast</li>
<li class="L1543" rel="L1543">of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody</li>
<li class="L1544" rel="L1544">better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own</li>
<li class="L1545" rel="L1545">partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother</li>
<li class="L1546" rel="L1546">Gardiner&#39;s in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was</li>
<li class="L1547" rel="L1547">sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he</li>
<li class="L1548" rel="L1548">did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses</li>
<li class="L1549" rel="L1549">on her, and very pretty they were.”</li>
<li class="L1550" rel="L1550"></li>
<li class="L1551" rel="L1551">“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth impatiently. “There has</li>
<li class="L1552" rel="L1552">been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first</li>
<li class="L1553" rel="L1553">discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”</li>
<li class="L1554" rel="L1554"></li>
<li class="L1555" rel="L1555">“I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said Darcy.</li>
<li class="L1556" rel="L1556"></li>
<li class="L1557" rel="L1557">“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is</li>
<li class="L1558" rel="L1558">strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I</li>
<li class="L1559" rel="L1559">am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”</li>
<li class="L1560" rel="L1560"></li>
<li class="L1561" rel="L1561">Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth</li>
<li class="L1562" rel="L1562">tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to</li>
<li class="L1563" rel="L1563">speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.</li>
<li class="L1564" rel="L1564">Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to</li>
<li class="L1565" rel="L1565">Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was</li>
<li class="L1566" rel="L1566">unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be</li>
<li class="L1567" rel="L1567">civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part</li>
<li class="L1568" rel="L1568">indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and</li>
<li class="L1569" rel="L1569">soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of</li>
<li class="L1570" rel="L1570">her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to</li>
<li class="L1571" rel="L1571">each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the</li>
<li class="L1572" rel="L1572">youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming</li>
<li class="L1573" rel="L1573">into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.</li>
<li class="L1574" rel="L1574"></li>
<li class="L1575" rel="L1575">Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion</li>
<li class="L1576" rel="L1576">and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose</li>
<li class="L1577" rel="L1577">affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high</li>
<li class="L1578" rel="L1578">animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the</li>
<li class="L1579" rel="L1579">attention of the officers, to whom her uncle&#39;s good dinners, and her own</li>
<li class="L1580" rel="L1580">easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very</li>
<li class="L1581" rel="L1581">equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and</li>
<li class="L1582" rel="L1582">abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most</li>
<li class="L1583" rel="L1583">shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this</li>
<li class="L1584" rel="L1584">sudden attack was delightful to their mother&#39;s ear:</li>
<li class="L1585" rel="L1585"></li>
<li class="L1586" rel="L1586">“I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when</li>
<li class="L1587" rel="L1587">your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of</li>
<li class="L1588" rel="L1588">the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.”</li>
<li class="L1589" rel="L1589"></li>
<li class="L1590" rel="L1590">Lydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh! yes--it would be much better to</li>
<li class="L1591" rel="L1591">wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter</li>
<li class="L1592" rel="L1592">would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,” she</li>
<li class="L1593" rel="L1593">added, “I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel</li>
<li class="L1594" rel="L1594">Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.”</li>
<li class="L1595" rel="L1595"></li>
<li class="L1596" rel="L1596">Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned</li>
<li class="L1597" rel="L1597">instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations&#39; behaviour to the</li>
<li class="L1598" rel="L1598">remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,</li>
<li class="L1599" rel="L1599">could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of</li>
<li class="L1600" rel="L1600">all Miss Bingley&#39;s witticisms on _fine eyes_.</li>
<li class="L1601" rel="L1601"></li>
<li class="L1602" rel="L1602"></li>
<li class="L1603" rel="L1603"></li>
<li class="L1604" rel="L1604">Chapter 10</li>
<li class="L1605" rel="L1605"></li>
<li class="L1606" rel="L1606"></li>
<li class="L1607" rel="L1607">The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss</li>
<li class="L1608" rel="L1608">Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who</li>
<li class="L1609" rel="L1609">continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined</li>
<li class="L1610" rel="L1610">their party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear.</li>
<li class="L1611" rel="L1611">Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching</li>
<li class="L1612" rel="L1612">the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by</li>
<li class="L1613" rel="L1613">messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and</li>
<li class="L1614" rel="L1614">Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.</li>
<li class="L1615" rel="L1615"></li>
<li class="L1616" rel="L1616">Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in</li>
<li class="L1617" rel="L1617">attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual</li>
<li class="L1618" rel="L1618">commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness</li>
<li class="L1619" rel="L1619">of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern</li>
<li class="L1620" rel="L1620">with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was</li>
<li class="L1621" rel="L1621">exactly in union with her opinion of each.</li>
<li class="L1622" rel="L1622"></li>
<li class="L1623" rel="L1623">“How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”</li>
<li class="L1624" rel="L1624"></li>
<li class="L1625" rel="L1625">He made no answer.</li>
<li class="L1626" rel="L1626"></li>
<li class="L1627" rel="L1627">“You write uncommonly fast.”</li>
<li class="L1628" rel="L1628"></li>
<li class="L1629" rel="L1629">“You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.”</li>
<li class="L1630" rel="L1630"></li>
<li class="L1631" rel="L1631">“How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a</li>
<li class="L1632" rel="L1632">year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!”</li>
<li class="L1633" rel="L1633"></li>
<li class="L1634" rel="L1634">“It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.”</li>
<li class="L1635" rel="L1635"></li>
<li class="L1636" rel="L1636">“Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”</li>
<li class="L1637" rel="L1637"></li>
<li class="L1638" rel="L1638">“I have already told her so once, by your desire.”</li>
<li class="L1639" rel="L1639"></li>
<li class="L1640" rel="L1640">“I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend</li>
<li class="L1641" rel="L1641">pens remarkably well.”</li>
<li class="L1642" rel="L1642"></li>
<li class="L1643" rel="L1643">“Thank you--but I always mend my own.”</li>
<li class="L1644" rel="L1644"></li>
<li class="L1645" rel="L1645">“How can you contrive to write so even?”</li>
<li class="L1646" rel="L1646"></li>
<li class="L1647" rel="L1647">He was silent.</li>
<li class="L1648" rel="L1648"></li>
<li class="L1649" rel="L1649">“Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp;</li>
<li class="L1650" rel="L1650">and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful</li>
<li class="L1651" rel="L1651">little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss</li>
<li class="L1652" rel="L1652">Grantley&#39;s.”</li>
<li class="L1653" rel="L1653"></li>
<li class="L1654" rel="L1654">“Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At</li>
<li class="L1655" rel="L1655">present I have not room to do them justice.”</li>
<li class="L1656" rel="L1656"></li>
<li class="L1657" rel="L1657">“Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you</li>
<li class="L1658" rel="L1658">always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”</li>
<li class="L1659" rel="L1659"></li>
<li class="L1660" rel="L1660">“They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me</li>
<li class="L1661" rel="L1661">to determine.”</li>
<li class="L1662" rel="L1662"></li>
<li class="L1663" rel="L1663">“It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with</li>
<li class="L1664" rel="L1664">ease, cannot write ill.”</li>
<li class="L1665" rel="L1665"></li>
<li class="L1666" rel="L1666">“That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her</li>
<li class="L1667" rel="L1667">brother, “because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much for</li>
<li class="L1668" rel="L1668">words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?”</li>
<li class="L1669" rel="L1669"></li>
<li class="L1670" rel="L1670">“My style of writing is very different from yours.”</li>
<li class="L1671" rel="L1671"></li>
<li class="L1672" rel="L1672">“Oh!” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way</li>
<li class="L1673" rel="L1673">imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”</li>
<li class="L1674" rel="L1674"></li>
<li class="L1675" rel="L1675">“My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which</li>
<li class="L1676" rel="L1676">means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.”</li>
<li class="L1677" rel="L1677"></li>
<li class="L1678" rel="L1678">“Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”</li>
<li class="L1679" rel="L1679"></li>
<li class="L1680" rel="L1680">“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of</li>
<li class="L1681" rel="L1681">humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an</li>
<li class="L1682" rel="L1682">indirect boast.”</li>
<li class="L1683" rel="L1683"></li>
<li class="L1684" rel="L1684">“And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?”</li>
<li class="L1685" rel="L1685"></li>
<li class="L1686" rel="L1686">“The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in</li>
<li class="L1687" rel="L1687">writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of</li>
<li class="L1688" rel="L1688">thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you</li>
<li class="L1689" rel="L1689">think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with</li>
<li class="L1690" rel="L1690">quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any</li>
<li class="L1691" rel="L1691">attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.</li>
<li class="L1692" rel="L1692">Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield</li>
<li class="L1693" rel="L1693">you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of</li>
<li class="L1694" rel="L1694">panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very</li>
<li class="L1695" rel="L1695">laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business</li>
<li class="L1696" rel="L1696">undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”</li>
<li class="L1697" rel="L1697"></li>
<li class="L1698" rel="L1698">“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the</li>
<li class="L1699" rel="L1699">foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour,</li>
<li class="L1700" rel="L1700">I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this</li>
<li class="L1701" rel="L1701">moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless</li>
<li class="L1702" rel="L1702">precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”</li>
<li class="L1703" rel="L1703"></li>
<li class="L1704" rel="L1704">“I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that</li>
<li class="L1705" rel="L1705">you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as</li>
<li class="L1706" rel="L1706">dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were</li>
<li class="L1707" rel="L1707">mounting your horse, a friend were to say, &#39;Bingley, you had better</li>
<li class="L1708" rel="L1708">stay till next week,&#39; you would probably do it, you would probably not</li>
<li class="L1709" rel="L1709">go--and at another word, might stay a month.”</li>
<li class="L1710" rel="L1710"></li>
<li class="L1711" rel="L1711">“You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley did</li>
<li class="L1712" rel="L1712">not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much</li>
<li class="L1713" rel="L1713">more than he did himself.”</li>
<li class="L1714" rel="L1714"></li>
<li class="L1715" rel="L1715">“I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what my</li>
<li class="L1716" rel="L1716">friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am</li>
<li class="L1717" rel="L1717">afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means</li>
<li class="L1718" rel="L1718">intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a</li>
<li class="L1719" rel="L1719">circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I</li>
<li class="L1720" rel="L1720">could.”</li>
<li class="L1721" rel="L1721"></li>
<li class="L1722" rel="L1722">“Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions</li>
<li class="L1723" rel="L1723">as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”</li>
<li class="L1724" rel="L1724"></li>
<li class="L1725" rel="L1725">“Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for</li>
<li class="L1726" rel="L1726">himself.”</li>
<li class="L1727" rel="L1727"></li>
<li class="L1728" rel="L1728">“You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,</li>
<li class="L1729" rel="L1729">but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to</li>
<li class="L1730" rel="L1730">stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,</li>
<li class="L1731" rel="L1731">that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and</li>
<li class="L1732" rel="L1732">the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering</li>
<li class="L1733" rel="L1733">one argument in favour of its propriety.”</li>
<li class="L1734" rel="L1734"></li>
<li class="L1735" rel="L1735">“To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit</li>
<li class="L1736" rel="L1736">with you.”</li>
<li class="L1737" rel="L1737"></li>
<li class="L1738" rel="L1738">“To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of</li>
<li class="L1739" rel="L1739">either.”</li>
<li class="L1740" rel="L1740"></li>
<li class="L1741" rel="L1741">“You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of</li>
<li class="L1742" rel="L1742">friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make</li>
<li class="L1743" rel="L1743">one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason</li>
<li class="L1744" rel="L1744">one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have</li>
<li class="L1745" rel="L1745">supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the</li>
<li class="L1746" rel="L1746">circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour</li>
<li class="L1747" rel="L1747">thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,</li>
<li class="L1748" rel="L1748">where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no</li>
<li class="L1749" rel="L1749">very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying</li>
<li class="L1750" rel="L1750">with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”</li>
<li class="L1751" rel="L1751"></li>
<li class="L1752" rel="L1752">“Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to</li>
<li class="L1753" rel="L1753">arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to</li>
<li class="L1754" rel="L1754">appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting</li>
<li class="L1755" rel="L1755">between the parties?”</li>
<li class="L1756" rel="L1756"></li>
<li class="L1757" rel="L1757">“By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not</li>
<li class="L1758" rel="L1758">forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more</li>
<li class="L1759" rel="L1759">weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure</li>
<li class="L1760" rel="L1760">you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with</li>
<li class="L1761" rel="L1761">myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not</li>
<li class="L1762" rel="L1762">know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in</li>
<li class="L1763" rel="L1763">particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,</li>
<li class="L1764" rel="L1764">when he has nothing to do.”</li>
<li class="L1765" rel="L1765"></li>
<li class="L1766" rel="L1766">Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was</li>
<li class="L1767" rel="L1767">rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly</li>
<li class="L1768" rel="L1768">resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her</li>
<li class="L1769" rel="L1769">brother for talking such nonsense.</li>
<li class="L1770" rel="L1770"></li>
<li class="L1771" rel="L1771">“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an argument,</li>
<li class="L1772" rel="L1772">and want to silence this.”</li>
<li class="L1773" rel="L1773"></li>
<li class="L1774" rel="L1774">“Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss</li>
<li class="L1775" rel="L1775">Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very</li>
<li class="L1776" rel="L1776">thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”</li>
<li class="L1777" rel="L1777"></li>
<li class="L1778" rel="L1778">“What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.</li>
<li class="L1779" rel="L1779">Darcy had much better finish his letter.”</li>
<li class="L1780" rel="L1780"></li>
<li class="L1781" rel="L1781">Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.</li>
<li class="L1782" rel="L1782"></li>
<li class="L1783" rel="L1783">When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth</li>
<li class="L1784" rel="L1784">for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity</li>
<li class="L1785" rel="L1785">to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead</li>
<li class="L1786" rel="L1786">the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she</li>
<li class="L1787" rel="L1787">seated herself.</li>
<li class="L1788" rel="L1788"></li>
<li class="L1789" rel="L1789">Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed,</li>
<li class="L1790" rel="L1790">Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books</li>
<li class="L1791" rel="L1791">that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy&#39;s eyes were fixed</li>
<li class="L1792" rel="L1792">on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of</li>
<li class="L1793" rel="L1793">admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her</li>
<li class="L1794" rel="L1794">because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine,</li>
<li class="L1795" rel="L1795">however, at last that she drew his notice because there was something</li>
<li class="L1796" rel="L1796">more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in</li>
<li class="L1797" rel="L1797">any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked</li>
<li class="L1798" rel="L1798">him too little to care for his approbation.</li>
<li class="L1799" rel="L1799"></li>
<li class="L1800" rel="L1800">After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by</li>
<li class="L1801" rel="L1801">a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near</li>
<li class="L1802" rel="L1802">Elizabeth, said to her:</li>
<li class="L1803" rel="L1803"></li>
<li class="L1804" rel="L1804">“Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an</li>
<li class="L1805" rel="L1805">opportunity of dancing a reel?”</li>
<li class="L1806" rel="L1806"></li>
<li class="L1807" rel="L1807">She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some</li>
<li class="L1808" rel="L1808">surprise at her silence.</li>
<li class="L1809" rel="L1809"></li>
<li class="L1810" rel="L1810">“Oh!” said she, “I heard you before, but I could not immediately</li>
<li class="L1811" rel="L1811">determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say &#39;Yes,&#39;</li>
<li class="L1812" rel="L1812">that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always</li>
<li class="L1813" rel="L1813">delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of</li>
<li class="L1814" rel="L1814">their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell</li>
<li class="L1815" rel="L1815">you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if</li>
<li class="L1816" rel="L1816">you dare.”</li>
<li class="L1817" rel="L1817"></li>
<li class="L1818" rel="L1818">“Indeed I do not dare.”</li>
<li class="L1819" rel="L1819"></li>
<li class="L1820" rel="L1820">Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his</li>
<li class="L1821" rel="L1821">gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her</li>
<li class="L1822" rel="L1822">manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy</li>
<li class="L1823" rel="L1823">had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really</li>
<li class="L1824" rel="L1824">believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he</li>
<li class="L1825" rel="L1825">should be in some danger.</li>
<li class="L1826" rel="L1826"></li>
<li class="L1827" rel="L1827">Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great</li>
<li class="L1828" rel="L1828">anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some</li>
<li class="L1829" rel="L1829">assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.</li>
<li class="L1830" rel="L1830"></li>
<li class="L1831" rel="L1831">She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of</li>
<li class="L1832" rel="L1832">their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.</li>
<li class="L1833" rel="L1833"></li>
<li class="L1834" rel="L1834">“I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery</li>
<li class="L1835" rel="L1835">the next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this</li>
<li class="L1836" rel="L1836">desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;</li>
<li class="L1837" rel="L1837">and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after</li>
<li class="L1838" rel="L1838">officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to</li>
<li class="L1839" rel="L1839">check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,</li>
<li class="L1840" rel="L1840">which your lady possesses.”</li>
<li class="L1841" rel="L1841"></li>
<li class="L1842" rel="L1842">“Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”</li>
<li class="L1843" rel="L1843"></li>
<li class="L1844" rel="L1844">“Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed</li>
<li class="L1845" rel="L1845">in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the</li>
<li class="L1846" rel="L1846">judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different</li>
<li class="L1847" rel="L1847">lines. As for your Elizabeth&#39;s picture, you must not have it taken, for</li>
<li class="L1848" rel="L1848">what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”</li>
<li class="L1849" rel="L1849"></li>
<li class="L1850" rel="L1850">“It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their</li>
<li class="L1851" rel="L1851">colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be</li>
<li class="L1852" rel="L1852">copied.”</li>
<li class="L1853" rel="L1853"></li>
<li class="L1854" rel="L1854">At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and</li>
<li class="L1855" rel="L1855">Elizabeth herself.</li>
<li class="L1856" rel="L1856"></li>
<li class="L1857" rel="L1857">“I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in some</li>
<li class="L1858" rel="L1858">confusion, lest they had been overheard.</li>
<li class="L1859" rel="L1859"></li>
<li class="L1860" rel="L1860">“You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away without</li>
<li class="L1861" rel="L1861">telling us that you were coming out.”</li>
<li class="L1862" rel="L1862"></li>
<li class="L1863" rel="L1863">Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk</li>
<li class="L1864" rel="L1864">by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,</li>
<li class="L1865" rel="L1865">and immediately said:</li>
<li class="L1866" rel="L1866"></li>
<li class="L1867" rel="L1867">“This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the</li>
<li class="L1868" rel="L1868">avenue.”</li>
<li class="L1869" rel="L1869"></li>
<li class="L1870" rel="L1870">But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,</li>
<li class="L1871" rel="L1871">laughingly answered:</li>
<li class="L1872" rel="L1872"></li>
<li class="L1873" rel="L1873">“No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear</li>
<li class="L1874" rel="L1874">to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a</li>
<li class="L1875" rel="L1875">fourth. Good-bye.”</li>
<li class="L1876" rel="L1876"></li>
<li class="L1877" rel="L1877">She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of</li>
<li class="L1878" rel="L1878">being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered</li>
<li class="L1879" rel="L1879">as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.</li>
<li class="L1880" rel="L1880"></li>
<li class="L1881" rel="L1881"></li>
<li class="L1882" rel="L1882"></li>
<li class="L1883" rel="L1883">Chapter 11</li>
<li class="L1884" rel="L1884"></li>
<li class="L1885" rel="L1885"></li>
<li class="L1886" rel="L1886">When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her</li>
<li class="L1887" rel="L1887">sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the</li>
<li class="L1888" rel="L1888">drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many</li>
<li class="L1889" rel="L1889">professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable</li>
<li class="L1890" rel="L1890">as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.</li>
<li class="L1891" rel="L1891">Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an</li>
<li class="L1892" rel="L1892">entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh</li>
<li class="L1893" rel="L1893">at their acquaintance with spirit.</li>
<li class="L1894" rel="L1894"></li>
<li class="L1895" rel="L1895">But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;</li>
<li class="L1896" rel="L1896">Miss Bingley&#39;s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had</li>
<li class="L1897" rel="L1897">something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed</li>
<li class="L1898" rel="L1898">himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also</li>
<li class="L1899" rel="L1899">made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness</li>
<li class="L1900" rel="L1900">and warmth remained for Bingley&#39;s salutation. He was full of joy and</li>
<li class="L1901" rel="L1901">attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she</li>
<li class="L1902" rel="L1902">should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire</li>
<li class="L1903" rel="L1903">to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from</li>
<li class="L1904" rel="L1904">the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone</li>
<li class="L1905" rel="L1905">else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great</li>
<li class="L1906" rel="L1906">delight.</li>
<li class="L1907" rel="L1907"></li>
<li class="L1908" rel="L1908">When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the</li>
<li class="L1909" rel="L1909">card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.</li>
<li class="L1910" rel="L1910">Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open</li>
<li class="L1911" rel="L1911">petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and</li>
<li class="L1912" rel="L1912">the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.</li>
<li class="L1913" rel="L1913">Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the</li>
<li class="L1914" rel="L1914">sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;</li>
<li class="L1915" rel="L1915">and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets</li>
<li class="L1916" rel="L1916">and rings, joined now and then in her brother&#39;s conversation with Miss</li>
<li class="L1917" rel="L1917">Bennet.</li>
<li class="L1918" rel="L1918"></li>
<li class="L1919" rel="L1919">Miss Bingley&#39;s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.</li>
<li class="L1920" rel="L1920">Darcy&#39;s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she</li>
<li class="L1921" rel="L1921">was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She</li>
<li class="L1922" rel="L1922">could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her</li>
<li class="L1923" rel="L1923">question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be</li>
<li class="L1924" rel="L1924">amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the</li>
<li class="L1925" rel="L1925">second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant</li>
<li class="L1926" rel="L1926">it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no</li>
<li class="L1927" rel="L1927">enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a</li>
<li class="L1928" rel="L1928">book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not</li>
<li class="L1929" rel="L1929">an excellent library.”</li>
<li class="L1930" rel="L1930"></li>
<li class="L1931" rel="L1931">No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and</li>
<li class="L1932" rel="L1932">cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing</li>
<li class="L1933" rel="L1933">her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly</li>
<li class="L1934" rel="L1934">towards him and said:</li>
<li class="L1935" rel="L1935"></li>
<li class="L1936" rel="L1936">“By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at</li>
<li class="L1937" rel="L1937">Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult</li>
<li class="L1938" rel="L1938">the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are</li>
<li class="L1939" rel="L1939">not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a</li>
<li class="L1940" rel="L1940">pleasure.”</li>
<li class="L1941" rel="L1941"></li>
<li class="L1942" rel="L1942">“If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he</li>
<li class="L1943" rel="L1943">chooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled</li>
<li class="L1944" rel="L1944">thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send</li>
<li class="L1945" rel="L1945">round my cards.”</li>
<li class="L1946" rel="L1946"></li>
<li class="L1947" rel="L1947">“I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were</li>
<li class="L1948" rel="L1948">carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably</li>
<li class="L1949" rel="L1949">tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much</li>
<li class="L1950" rel="L1950">more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of</li>
<li class="L1951" rel="L1951">the day.”</li>
<li class="L1952" rel="L1952"></li>
<li class="L1953" rel="L1953">“Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be</li>
<li class="L1954" rel="L1954">near so much like a ball.”</li>
<li class="L1955" rel="L1955"></li>
<li class="L1956" rel="L1956">Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked</li>
<li class="L1957" rel="L1957">about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but</li>
<li class="L1958" rel="L1958">Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In</li>
<li class="L1959" rel="L1959">the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and,</li>
<li class="L1960" rel="L1960">turning to Elizabeth, said:</li>
<li class="L1961" rel="L1961"></li>
<li class="L1962" rel="L1962">“Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a</li>
<li class="L1963" rel="L1963">turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so</li>
<li class="L1964" rel="L1964">long in one attitude.”</li>
<li class="L1965" rel="L1965"></li>
<li class="L1966" rel="L1966">Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley</li>
<li class="L1967" rel="L1967">succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked</li>
<li class="L1968" rel="L1968">up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as</li>
<li class="L1969" rel="L1969">Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was</li>
<li class="L1970" rel="L1970">directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that</li>
<li class="L1971" rel="L1971">he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down</li>
<li class="L1972" rel="L1972">the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would</li>
<li class="L1973" rel="L1973">interfere. “What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his</li>
<li class="L1974" rel="L1974">meaning?”--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?</li>
<li class="L1975" rel="L1975"></li>
<li class="L1976" rel="L1976">“Not at all,” was her answer; “but depend upon it, he means to be severe</li>
<li class="L1977" rel="L1977">on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing</li>
<li class="L1978" rel="L1978">about it.”</li>
<li class="L1979" rel="L1979"></li>
<li class="L1980" rel="L1980">Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in</li>
<li class="L1981" rel="L1981">anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his</li>
<li class="L1982" rel="L1982">two motives.</li>
<li class="L1983" rel="L1983"></li>
<li class="L1984" rel="L1984">“I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon</li>
<li class="L1985" rel="L1985">as she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this method of passing</li>
<li class="L1986" rel="L1986">the evening because you are in each other&#39;s confidence, and have secret</li>
<li class="L1987" rel="L1987">affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures</li>
<li class="L1988" rel="L1988">appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be</li>
<li class="L1989" rel="L1989">completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better</li>
<li class="L1990" rel="L1990">as I sit by the fire.”</li>
<li class="L1991" rel="L1991"></li>
<li class="L1992" rel="L1992">“Oh! shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything so</li>
<li class="L1993" rel="L1993">abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”</li>
<li class="L1994" rel="L1994"></li>
<li class="L1995" rel="L1995">“Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. “We</li>
<li class="L1996" rel="L1996">can all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate</li>
<li class="L1997" rel="L1997">as you are, you must know how it is to be done.”</li>
<li class="L1998" rel="L1998"></li>
<li class="L1999" rel="L1999">“But upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has</li>
<li class="L2000" rel="L2000">not yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and presence of</li>
<li class="L2001" rel="L2001">mind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will</li>
<li class="L2002" rel="L2002">not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a</li>
<li class="L2003" rel="L2003">subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.”</li>
<li class="L2004" rel="L2004"></li>
<li class="L2005" rel="L2005">“Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an</li>
<li class="L2006" rel="L2006">uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would</li>
<li class="L2007" rel="L2007">be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a</li>
<li class="L2008" rel="L2008">laugh.”</li>
<li class="L2009" rel="L2009"></li>
<li class="L2010" rel="L2010">“Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me more credit than can be.</li>
<li class="L2011" rel="L2011">The wisest and the best of men--nay, the wisest and best of their</li>
<li class="L2012" rel="L2012">actions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in</li>
<li class="L2013" rel="L2013">life is a joke.”</li>
<li class="L2014" rel="L2014"></li>
<li class="L2015" rel="L2015">“Certainly,” replied Elizabeth--“there are such people, but I hope I</li>
<li class="L2016" rel="L2016">am not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.</li>
<li class="L2017" rel="L2017">Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own,</li>
<li class="L2018" rel="L2018">and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely</li>
<li class="L2019" rel="L2019">what you are without.”</li>
<li class="L2020" rel="L2020"></li>
<li class="L2021" rel="L2021">“Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study</li>
<li class="L2022" rel="L2022">of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong</li>
<li class="L2023" rel="L2023">understanding to ridicule.”</li>
<li class="L2024" rel="L2024"></li>
<li class="L2025" rel="L2025">“Such as vanity and pride.”</li>
<li class="L2026" rel="L2026"></li>
<li class="L2027" rel="L2027">“Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real</li>
<li class="L2028" rel="L2028">superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.”</li>
<li class="L2029" rel="L2029"></li>
<li class="L2030" rel="L2030">Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.</li>
<li class="L2031" rel="L2031"></li>
<li class="L2032" rel="L2032">“Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss Bingley;</li>
<li class="L2033" rel="L2033">“and pray what is the result?”</li>
<li class="L2034" rel="L2034"></li>
<li class="L2035" rel="L2035">“I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it</li>
<li class="L2036" rel="L2036">himself without disguise.”</li>
<li class="L2037" rel="L2037"></li>
<li class="L2038" rel="L2038">“No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,</li>
<li class="L2039" rel="L2039">but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch</li>
<li class="L2040" rel="L2040">for. It is, I believe, too little yielding--certainly too little for the</li>
<li class="L2041" rel="L2041">convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others</li>
<li class="L2042" rel="L2042">so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings</li>
<li class="L2043" rel="L2043">are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper</li>
<li class="L2044" rel="L2044">would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost</li>
<li class="L2045" rel="L2045">forever.”</li>
<li class="L2046" rel="L2046"></li>
<li class="L2047" rel="L2047">“_That_ is a failing indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable resentment</li>
<li class="L2048" rel="L2048">_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I</li>
<li class="L2049" rel="L2049">really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.”</li>
<li class="L2050" rel="L2050"></li>
<li class="L2051" rel="L2051">“There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular</li>
<li class="L2052" rel="L2052">evil--a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”</li>
<li class="L2053" rel="L2053"></li>
<li class="L2054" rel="L2054">“And _your_ defect is to hate everybody.”</li>
<li class="L2055" rel="L2055"></li>
<li class="L2056" rel="L2056">“And yours,” he replied with a smile, “is willfully to misunderstand</li>
<li class="L2057" rel="L2057">them.”</li>
<li class="L2058" rel="L2058"></li>
<li class="L2059" rel="L2059">“Do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of a</li>
<li class="L2060" rel="L2060">conversation in which she had no share. “Louisa, you will not mind my</li>
<li class="L2061" rel="L2061">waking Mr. Hurst?”</li>
<li class="L2062" rel="L2062"></li>
<li class="L2063" rel="L2063">Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was</li>
<li class="L2064" rel="L2064">opened; and Darcy, after a few moments&#39; recollection, was not sorry for</li>
<li class="L2065" rel="L2065">it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.</li>
<li class="L2066" rel="L2066"></li>

<li class="L2070" rel="L2070"></li>
<li class="L2071" rel="L2071"></li>
<li class="L2072" rel="L2072">In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the</li>
<li class="L2073" rel="L2073">next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for</li>
<li class="L2074" rel="L2074">them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on</li>
<li class="L2075" rel="L2075">her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which</li>
<li class="L2076" rel="L2076">would exactly finish Jane&#39;s week, could not bring herself to receive</li>
<li class="L2077" rel="L2077">them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at</li>
<li class="L2078" rel="L2078">least not to Elizabeth&#39;s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.</li>
<li class="L2079" rel="L2079">Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage</li>
<li class="L2080" rel="L2080">before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley</li>
<li class="L2081" rel="L2081">and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them</li>
<li class="L2082" rel="L2082">very well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively</li>
<li class="L2083" rel="L2083">resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the</li>
<li class="L2084" rel="L2084">contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,</li>
<li class="L2085" rel="L2085">she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley&#39;s carriage immediately, and at</li>
<li class="L2086" rel="L2086">length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield</li>
<li class="L2087" rel="L2087">that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.</li>
<li class="L2088" rel="L2088"></li>
<li class="L2089" rel="L2089">The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was</li>
<li class="L2090" rel="L2090">said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work</li>
<li class="L2091" rel="L2091">on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was</li>
<li class="L2092" rel="L2092">then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike</li>
<li class="L2093" rel="L2093">of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.</li>
<li class="L2094" rel="L2094"></li>
<li class="L2095" rel="L2095">The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so</li>
<li class="L2096" rel="L2096">soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be</li>
<li class="L2097" rel="L2097">safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where</li>
<li class="L2098" rel="L2098">she felt herself to be right.</li>
<li class="L2099" rel="L2099"></li>
<li class="L2100" rel="L2100">To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at</li>
<li class="L2101" rel="L2101">Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss</li>
<li class="L2102" rel="L2102">Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teasing than usual to himself.</li>
<li class="L2103" rel="L2103">He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration</li>
<li class="L2104" rel="L2104">should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope</li>
<li class="L2105" rel="L2105">of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been</li>
<li class="L2106" rel="L2106">suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight</li>
<li class="L2107" rel="L2107">in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke</li>
<li class="L2108" rel="L2108">ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were</li>
<li class="L2109" rel="L2109">at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most</li>
<li class="L2110" rel="L2110">conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.</li>
<li class="L2111" rel="L2111"></li>
<li class="L2112" rel="L2112">On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost</li>
<li class="L2113" rel="L2113">all, took place. Miss Bingley&#39;s civility to Elizabeth increased at last</li>
<li class="L2114" rel="L2114">very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,</li>
<li class="L2115" rel="L2115">after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her</li>
<li class="L2116" rel="L2116">to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most</li>
<li class="L2117" rel="L2117">tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of</li>
<li class="L2118" rel="L2118">the whole party in the liveliest of spirits.</li>
<li class="L2119" rel="L2119"></li>
<li class="L2120" rel="L2120">They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet</li>
<li class="L2121" rel="L2121">wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much</li>
<li class="L2122" rel="L2122">trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their</li>
<li class="L2123" rel="L2123">father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really</li>
<li class="L2124" rel="L2124">glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The</li>
<li class="L2125" rel="L2125">evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of</li>
<li class="L2126" rel="L2126">its animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and</li>
<li class="L2127" rel="L2127">Elizabeth.</li>
<li class="L2128" rel="L2128"></li>
<li class="L2129" rel="L2129">They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human</li>
<li class="L2130" rel="L2130">nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of</li>
<li class="L2131" rel="L2131">threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information</li>
<li class="L2132" rel="L2132">for them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been said</li>
<li class="L2133" rel="L2133">in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers</li>
<li class="L2134" rel="L2134">had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it</li>
<li class="L2135" rel="L2135">had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.</li>
<li class="L2136" rel="L2136"></li>

<li class="L2141" rel="L2141"></li>
<li class="L2142" rel="L2142">“I hope, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at</li>
<li class="L2143" rel="L2143">breakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,</li>
<li class="L2144" rel="L2144">because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.”</li>
<li class="L2145" rel="L2145"></li>
<li class="L2146" rel="L2146">“Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,</li>
<li class="L2147" rel="L2147">unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in--and I hope _my_ dinners</li>
<li class="L2148" rel="L2148">are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.”</li>
<li class="L2149" rel="L2149"></li>
<li class="L2150" rel="L2150">“The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.”</li>
<li class="L2151" rel="L2151"></li>
<li class="L2152" rel="L2152">Mrs. Bennet&#39;s eyes sparkled. “A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.</li>
<li class="L2153" rel="L2153">Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.</li>
<li class="L2154" rel="L2154">Bingley. But--good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be</li>
<li class="L2155" rel="L2155">got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell--I must speak to Hill this</li>
<li class="L2156" rel="L2156">moment.”</li>
<li class="L2157" rel="L2157"></li>
<li class="L2158" rel="L2158">“It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom I</li>
<li class="L2159" rel="L2159">never saw in the whole course of my life.”</li>
<li class="L2160" rel="L2160"></li>
<li class="L2161" rel="L2161">This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being</li>
<li class="L2162" rel="L2162">eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.</li>
<li class="L2163" rel="L2163"></li>
<li class="L2164" rel="L2164">After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:</li>
<li class="L2165" rel="L2165"></li>
<li class="L2166" rel="L2166">“About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago</li>
<li class="L2167" rel="L2167">I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring</li>
<li class="L2168" rel="L2168">early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead,</li>
<li class="L2169" rel="L2169">may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.”</li>
<li class="L2170" rel="L2170"></li>
<li class="L2171" rel="L2171">“Oh! my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.</li>
<li class="L2172" rel="L2172">Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing</li>
<li class="L2173" rel="L2173">in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own</li>
<li class="L2174" rel="L2174">children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago</li>
<li class="L2175" rel="L2175">to do something or other about it.”</li>
<li class="L2176" rel="L2176"></li>
<li class="L2177" rel="L2177">Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They</li>
<li class="L2178" rel="L2178">had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which</li>
<li class="L2179" rel="L2179">Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail</li>
<li class="L2180" rel="L2180">bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of</li>
<li class="L2181" rel="L2181">five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.</li>
<li class="L2182" rel="L2182"></li>
<li class="L2183" rel="L2183">“It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet, “and</li>
<li class="L2184" rel="L2184">nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.</li>
<li class="L2185" rel="L2185">But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little</li>
<li class="L2186" rel="L2186">softened by his manner of expressing himself.”</li>
<li class="L2187" rel="L2187"></li>
<li class="L2188" rel="L2188">“No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of</li>
<li class="L2189" rel="L2189">him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false</li>
<li class="L2190" rel="L2190">friends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did</li>
<li class="L2191" rel="L2191">before him?”</li>
<li class="L2192" rel="L2192"></li>
<li class="L2193" rel="L2193">“Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that</li>
<li class="L2194" rel="L2194">head, as you will hear.”</li>
<li class="L2195" rel="L2195"></li>
<li class="L2196" rel="L2196">“Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.</li>
<li class="L2197" rel="L2197"></li>
<li class="L2198" rel="L2198">“Dear Sir,--</li>
<li class="L2199" rel="L2199"></li>
<li class="L2200" rel="L2200">“The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured</li>
<li class="L2201" rel="L2201">father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the</li>
<li class="L2202" rel="L2202">misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but</li>
<li class="L2203" rel="L2203">for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might</li>
<li class="L2204" rel="L2204">seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone</li>
<li class="L2205" rel="L2205">with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--&#39;There, Mrs.</li>
<li class="L2206" rel="L2206">Bennet.&#39;--My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having</li>
<li class="L2207" rel="L2207">received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be</li>
<li class="L2208" rel="L2208">distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de</li>
<li class="L2209" rel="L2209">Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has</li>
<li class="L2210" rel="L2210">preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be</li>
<li class="L2211" rel="L2211">my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her</li>
<li class="L2212" rel="L2212">ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which</li>
<li class="L2213" rel="L2213">are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I</li>
<li class="L2214" rel="L2214">feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in</li>
<li class="L2215" rel="L2215">all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I</li>
<li class="L2216" rel="L2216">flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and</li>
<li class="L2217" rel="L2217">that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate</li>
<li class="L2218" rel="L2218">will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the</li>
<li class="L2219" rel="L2219">offered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the</li>
<li class="L2220" rel="L2220">means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for</li>
<li class="L2221" rel="L2221">it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible</li>
<li class="L2222" rel="L2222">amends--but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to</li>
<li class="L2223" rel="L2223">receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting</li>
<li class="L2224" rel="L2224">on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o&#39;clock, and</li>
<li class="L2225" rel="L2225">shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se&#39;ennight</li>
<li class="L2226" rel="L2226">following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine</li>
<li class="L2227" rel="L2227">is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided</li>
<li class="L2228" rel="L2228">that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.--I</li>
<li class="L2229" rel="L2229">remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and</li>
<li class="L2230" rel="L2230">daughters, your well-wisher and friend,</li>
<li class="L2231" rel="L2231"></li>
<li class="L2232" rel="L2232">“WILLIAM COLLINS”</li>
<li class="L2233" rel="L2233"></li>
<li class="L2234" rel="L2234">“At four o&#39;clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,”</li>
<li class="L2235" rel="L2235"> said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. “He seems to be a most</li>
<li class="L2236" rel="L2236">conscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not will</li>
<li class="L2237" rel="L2237">prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so</li>
<li class="L2238" rel="L2238">indulgent as to let him come to us again.”</li>
<li class="L2239" rel="L2239"></li>
<li class="L2240" rel="L2240">“There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if</li>
<li class="L2241" rel="L2241">he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to</li>
<li class="L2242" rel="L2242">discourage him.”</li>
<li class="L2243" rel="L2243"></li>
<li class="L2244" rel="L2244">“Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can mean</li>
<li class="L2245" rel="L2245">to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his</li>
<li class="L2246" rel="L2246">credit.”</li>
<li class="L2247" rel="L2247"></li>
<li class="L2248" rel="L2248">Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady</li>
<li class="L2249" rel="L2249">Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying</li>
<li class="L2250" rel="L2250">his parishioners whenever it were required.</li>
<li class="L2251" rel="L2251"></li>
<li class="L2252" rel="L2252">“He must be an oddity, I think,” said she. “I cannot make him</li>
<li class="L2253" rel="L2253">out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he</li>
<li class="L2254" rel="L2254">mean by apologising for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he</li>
<li class="L2255" rel="L2255">would help it if he could.--Could he be a sensible man, sir?”</li>
<li class="L2256" rel="L2256"></li>
<li class="L2257" rel="L2257">“No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the</li>
<li class="L2258" rel="L2258">reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his</li>
<li class="L2259" rel="L2259">letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him.”</li>
<li class="L2260" rel="L2260"></li>
<li class="L2261" rel="L2261">“In point of composition,” said Mary, “the letter does not seem</li>
<li class="L2262" rel="L2262">defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I</li>
<li class="L2263" rel="L2263">think it is well expressed.”</li>
<li class="L2264" rel="L2264"></li>
<li class="L2265" rel="L2265">To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any</li>
<li class="L2266" rel="L2266">degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should</li>
<li class="L2267" rel="L2267">come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had</li>
<li class="L2268" rel="L2268">received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for</li>
<li class="L2269" rel="L2269">their mother, Mr. Collins&#39;s letter had done away much of her ill-will,</li>
<li class="L2270" rel="L2270">and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which</li>
<li class="L2271" rel="L2271">astonished her husband and daughters.</li>
<li class="L2272" rel="L2272"></li>
<li class="L2273" rel="L2273">Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great</li>
<li class="L2274" rel="L2274">politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the</li>
<li class="L2275" rel="L2275">ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in</li>
<li class="L2276" rel="L2276">need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a</li>
<li class="L2277" rel="L2277">tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and</li>
<li class="L2278" rel="L2278">stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated</li>
<li class="L2279" rel="L2279">before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of</li>
<li class="L2280" rel="L2280">daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this</li>
<li class="L2281" rel="L2281">instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did</li>
<li class="L2282" rel="L2282">not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. This</li>
<li class="L2283" rel="L2283">gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.</li>
<li class="L2284" rel="L2284">Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.</li>
<li class="L2285" rel="L2285"></li>
<li class="L2286" rel="L2286">“You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may</li>
<li class="L2287" rel="L2287">prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so</li>
<li class="L2288" rel="L2288">oddly.”</li>
<li class="L2289" rel="L2289"></li>
<li class="L2290" rel="L2290">“You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”</li>
<li class="L2291" rel="L2291"></li>
<li class="L2292" rel="L2292">“Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you</li>
<li class="L2293" rel="L2293">must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things</li>
<li class="L2294" rel="L2294">I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates</li>
<li class="L2295" rel="L2295">will go when once they come to be entailed.”</li>
<li class="L2296" rel="L2296"></li>
<li class="L2297" rel="L2297">“I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and</li>
<li class="L2298" rel="L2298">could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing</li>
<li class="L2299" rel="L2299">forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come</li>
<li class="L2300" rel="L2300">prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps,</li>
<li class="L2301" rel="L2301">when we are better acquainted--”</li>
<li class="L2302" rel="L2302"></li>
<li class="L2303" rel="L2303">He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each</li>
<li class="L2304" rel="L2304">other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins&#39;s admiration. The</li>
<li class="L2305" rel="L2305">hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;</li>
<li class="L2306" rel="L2306">and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet&#39;s</li>
<li class="L2307" rel="L2307">heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his</li>
<li class="L2308" rel="L2308">own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and</li>
<li class="L2309" rel="L2309">he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its</li>
<li class="L2310" rel="L2310">cooking was owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who</li>
<li class="L2311" rel="L2311">assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a</li>
<li class="L2312" rel="L2312">good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He</li>
<li class="L2313" rel="L2313">begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared</li>
<li class="L2314" rel="L2314">herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a</li>
<li class="L2315" rel="L2315">quarter of an hour.</li>
<li class="L2316" rel="L2316"></li>
<li class="L2317" rel="L2317"></li>

<li class="L2319" rel="L2319">Chapter 14</li>
<li class="L2320" rel="L2320"></li>
<li class="L2321" rel="L2321"></li>
<li class="L2322" rel="L2322">During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants</li>
<li class="L2323" rel="L2323">were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his</li>
<li class="L2324" rel="L2324">guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to</li>
<li class="L2325" rel="L2325">shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady</li>
<li class="L2326" rel="L2326">Catherine de Bourgh&#39;s attention to his wishes, and consideration for</li>
<li class="L2327" rel="L2327">his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen</li>
<li class="L2328" rel="L2328">better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him</li>
<li class="L2329" rel="L2329">to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect</li>
<li class="L2330" rel="L2330">he protested that “he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in</li>
<li class="L2331" rel="L2331">a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself</li>
<li class="L2332" rel="L2332">experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to</li>
<li class="L2333" rel="L2333">approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of</li>
<li class="L2334" rel="L2334">preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,</li>
<li class="L2335" rel="L2335">and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of</li>
<li class="L2336" rel="L2336">quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many</li>
<li class="L2337" rel="L2337">people he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.</li>
<li class="L2338" rel="L2338">She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she</li>
<li class="L2339" rel="L2339">made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the</li>
<li class="L2340" rel="L2340">neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or</li>
<li class="L2341" rel="L2341">two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to</li>
<li class="L2342" rel="L2342">marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had</li>
<li class="L2343" rel="L2343">once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly</li>
<li class="L2344" rel="L2344">approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed</li>
<li class="L2345" rel="L2345">to suggest some herself--some shelves in the closet up stairs.”</li>
<li class="L2346" rel="L2346"></li>
<li class="L2347" rel="L2347">“That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and</li>
<li class="L2348" rel="L2348">I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies</li>
<li class="L2349" rel="L2349">in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?”</li>
<li class="L2350" rel="L2350"></li>
<li class="L2351" rel="L2351">“The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane</li>
<li class="L2352" rel="L2352">from Rosings Park, her ladyship&#39;s residence.”</li>
<li class="L2353" rel="L2353"></li>
<li class="L2354" rel="L2354">“I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?”</li>
<li class="L2355" rel="L2355"></li>
<li class="L2356" rel="L2356">“She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very</li>
<li class="L2357" rel="L2357">extensive property.”</li>
<li class="L2358" rel="L2358"></li>
<li class="L2359" rel="L2359">“Ah!” said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than</li>
<li class="L2360" rel="L2360">many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?”</li>
<li class="L2361" rel="L2361"></li>
<li class="L2362" rel="L2362">“She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says</li>
<li class="L2363" rel="L2363">that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the</li>
<li class="L2364" rel="L2364">handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks</li>
<li class="L2365" rel="L2365">the young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly</li>
<li class="L2366" rel="L2366">constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many</li>
<li class="L2367" rel="L2367">accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am</li>
<li class="L2368" rel="L2368">informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still</li>
<li class="L2369" rel="L2369">resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends</li>
<li class="L2370" rel="L2370">to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.”</li>
<li class="L2371" rel="L2371"></li>
<li class="L2372" rel="L2372">“Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at</li>
<li class="L2373" rel="L2373">court.”</li>
<li class="L2374" rel="L2374"></li>
<li class="L2375" rel="L2375">“Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;</li>
<li class="L2376" rel="L2376">and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the</li>
<li class="L2377" rel="L2377">British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased</li>
<li class="L2378" rel="L2378">with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to</li>
<li class="L2379" rel="L2379">offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable</li>
<li class="L2380" rel="L2380">to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that</li>
<li class="L2381" rel="L2381">her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most</li>
<li class="L2382" rel="L2382">elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by</li>
<li class="L2383" rel="L2383">her. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and</li>
<li class="L2384" rel="L2384">it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to</li>
<li class="L2385" rel="L2385">pay.”</li>
<li class="L2386" rel="L2386"></li>
<li class="L2387" rel="L2387">“You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet, “and it is happy for you</li>
<li class="L2388" rel="L2388">that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask</li>
<li class="L2389" rel="L2389">whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the</li>
<li class="L2390" rel="L2390">moment, or are the result of previous study?”</li>
<li class="L2391" rel="L2391"></li>
<li class="L2392" rel="L2392">“They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I</li>
<li class="L2393" rel="L2393">sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant</li>
<li class="L2394" rel="L2394">compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to</li>
<li class="L2395" rel="L2395">give them as unstudied an air as possible.”</li>
<li class="L2396" rel="L2396"></li>
<li class="L2397" rel="L2397">Mr. Bennet&#39;s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd</li>
<li class="L2398" rel="L2398">as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,</li>
<li class="L2399" rel="L2399">maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,</li>
<li class="L2400" rel="L2400">and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner</li>
<li class="L2401" rel="L2401">in his pleasure.</li>
<li class="L2402" rel="L2402"></li>
<li class="L2403" rel="L2403">By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad</li>
<li class="L2404" rel="L2404">to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over,</li>
<li class="L2405" rel="L2405">glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily</li>
<li class="L2406" rel="L2406">assented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything</li>
<li class="L2407" rel="L2407">announced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and</li>
<li class="L2408" rel="L2408">begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at</li>
<li class="L2409" rel="L2409">him, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some</li>
<li class="L2410" rel="L2410">deliberation he chose Fordyce&#39;s Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the</li>
<li class="L2411" rel="L2411">volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three</li>
<li class="L2412" rel="L2412">pages, she interrupted him with:</li>
<li class="L2413" rel="L2413"></li>
<li class="L2414" rel="L2414">“Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away</li>
<li class="L2415" rel="L2415">Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me</li>
<li class="L2416" rel="L2416">so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more</li>
<li class="L2417" rel="L2417">about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.”</li>
<li class="L2418" rel="L2418"></li>
<li class="L2419" rel="L2419">Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.</li>
<li class="L2420" rel="L2420">Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:</li>
<li class="L2421" rel="L2421"></li>
<li class="L2422" rel="L2422">“I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books</li>
<li class="L2423" rel="L2423">of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes</li>
<li class="L2424" rel="L2424">me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to</li>
<li class="L2425" rel="L2425">them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.”</li>
<li class="L2426" rel="L2426"></li>
<li class="L2427" rel="L2427">Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at</li>
<li class="L2428" rel="L2428">backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted</li>
<li class="L2429" rel="L2429">very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.</li>
<li class="L2430" rel="L2430">Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia&#39;s</li>
<li class="L2431" rel="L2431">interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would</li>
<li class="L2432" rel="L2432">resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his</li>
<li class="L2433" rel="L2433">young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any</li>
<li class="L2434" rel="L2434">affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared</li>
<li class="L2435" rel="L2435">for backgammon.</li>
<li class="L2436" rel="L2436"></li>
<li class="L2437" rel="L2437"></li>
<li class="L2438" rel="L2438"></li>
<li class="L2439" rel="L2439">Chapter 15</li>
<li class="L2440" rel="L2440"></li>
<li class="L2441" rel="L2441"></li>
<li class="L2442" rel="L2442">Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had</li>
<li class="L2443" rel="L2443">been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part</li>
<li class="L2444" rel="L2444">of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and</li>
<li class="L2445" rel="L2445">miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he</li>
<li class="L2446" rel="L2446">had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful</li>
<li class="L2447" rel="L2447">acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had</li>
<li class="L2448" rel="L2448">given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a</li>
<li class="L2449" rel="L2449">good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in</li>
<li class="L2450" rel="L2450">retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected</li>
<li class="L2451" rel="L2451">prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de</li>
<li class="L2452" rel="L2452">Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which</li>
<li class="L2453" rel="L2453">he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,</li>
<li class="L2454" rel="L2454">mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a</li>
<li class="L2455" rel="L2455">clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of</li>
<li class="L2456" rel="L2456">pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.</li>
<li class="L2457" rel="L2457"></li>
<li class="L2458" rel="L2458">Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to</li>
<li class="L2459" rel="L2459">marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had</li>
<li class="L2460" rel="L2460">a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found</li>
<li class="L2461" rel="L2461">them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.</li>
<li class="L2462" rel="L2462">This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father&#39;s</li>
<li class="L2463" rel="L2463">estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and</li>
<li class="L2464" rel="L2464">suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own</li>
<li class="L2465" rel="L2465">part.</li>
<li class="L2466" rel="L2466"></li>
<li class="L2467" rel="L2467">His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet&#39;s lovely face</li>
<li class="L2468" rel="L2468">confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what</li>
<li class="L2469" rel="L2469">was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled</li>
<li class="L2470" rel="L2470">choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a</li>
<li class="L2471" rel="L2471">quarter of an hour&#39;s tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a</li>
<li class="L2472" rel="L2472">conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally</li>
<li class="L2473" rel="L2473">to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at</li>
<li class="L2474" rel="L2474">Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general</li>
<li class="L2475" rel="L2475">encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. “As to</li>
<li class="L2476" rel="L2476">her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could</li>
<li class="L2477" rel="L2477">not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession; her</li>
<li class="L2478" rel="L2478">_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her</li>
<li class="L2479" rel="L2479">to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”</li>
<li class="L2480" rel="L2480"></li>
<li class="L2481" rel="L2481">Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon</li>
<li class="L2482" rel="L2482">done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally</li>
<li class="L2483" rel="L2483">next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.</li>
<li class="L2484" rel="L2484"></li>
<li class="L2485" rel="L2485">Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have</li>
<li class="L2486" rel="L2486">two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of</li>
<li class="L2487" rel="L2487">the day before was now high in her good graces.</li>
<li class="L2488" rel="L2488"></li>
<li class="L2489" rel="L2489">Lydia&#39;s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister</li>
<li class="L2490" rel="L2490">except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,</li>
<li class="L2491" rel="L2491">at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,</li>
<li class="L2492" rel="L2492">and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed</li>
<li class="L2493" rel="L2493">him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with</li>
<li class="L2494" rel="L2494">one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.</li>
<li class="L2495" rel="L2495">Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such</li>
<li class="L2496" rel="L2496">doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been</li>
<li class="L2497" rel="L2497">always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told</li>
<li class="L2498" rel="L2498">Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the</li>
<li class="L2499" rel="L2499">house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,</li>
<li class="L2500" rel="L2500">was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their</li>
<li class="L2501" rel="L2501">walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker</li>
<li class="L2502" rel="L2502">than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.</li>
<li class="L2503" rel="L2503"></li>
<li class="L2504" rel="L2504">In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his</li>
<li class="L2505" rel="L2505">cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of</li>
<li class="L2506" rel="L2506">the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were</li>
<li class="L2507" rel="L2507">immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and</li>
<li class="L2508" rel="L2508">nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in</li>
<li class="L2509" rel="L2509">a shop window, could recall them.</li>
<li class="L2510" rel="L2510"></li>
<li class="L2511" rel="L2511">But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom</li>
<li class="L2512" rel="L2512">they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking</li>
<li class="L2513" rel="L2513">with another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was</li>
<li class="L2514" rel="L2514">the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came</li>
<li class="L2515" rel="L2515">to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the</li>
<li class="L2516" rel="L2516">stranger&#39;s air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia,</li>
<li class="L2517" rel="L2517">determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under</li>
<li class="L2518" rel="L2518">pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately</li>
<li class="L2519" rel="L2519">had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had</li>
<li class="L2520" rel="L2520">reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated</li>
<li class="L2521" rel="L2521">permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with</li>
<li class="L2522" rel="L2522">him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a</li>
<li class="L2523" rel="L2523">commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the</li>
<li class="L2524" rel="L2524">young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.</li>
<li class="L2525" rel="L2525">His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of</li>
<li class="L2526" rel="L2526">beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.</li>
<li class="L2527" rel="L2527">The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness</li>
<li class="L2528" rel="L2528">of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and</li>
<li class="L2529" rel="L2529">unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together</li>
<li class="L2530" rel="L2530">very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy</li>
<li class="L2531" rel="L2531">and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the</li>
<li class="L2532" rel="L2532">ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and</li>
<li class="L2533" rel="L2533">began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and</li>
<li class="L2534" rel="L2534">Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to</li>
<li class="L2535" rel="L2535">Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated</li>
<li class="L2536" rel="L2536">it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes</li>
<li class="L2537" rel="L2537">on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the</li>
<li class="L2538" rel="L2538">stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they</li>
<li class="L2539" rel="L2539">looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.</li>
<li class="L2540" rel="L2540">Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham,</li>
<li class="L2541" rel="L2541">after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just</li>
<li class="L2542" rel="L2542">deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to</li>
<li class="L2543" rel="L2543">imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.</li>
<li class="L2544" rel="L2544"></li>
<li class="L2545" rel="L2545">In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what</li>
<li class="L2546" rel="L2546">passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.</li>
<li class="L2547" rel="L2547"></li>
<li class="L2548" rel="L2548">Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of</li>
<li class="L2549" rel="L2549">Mr. Phillip&#39;s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia&#39;s</li>
<li class="L2550" rel="L2550">pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of</li>
<li class="L2551" rel="L2551">Mrs. Phillips&#39;s throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the</li>
<li class="L2552" rel="L2552">invitation.</li>
<li class="L2553" rel="L2553"></li>
<li class="L2554" rel="L2554">Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest,</li>
<li class="L2555" rel="L2555">from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was</li>
<li class="L2556" rel="L2556">eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as</li>
<li class="L2557" rel="L2557">their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing</li>
<li class="L2558" rel="L2558">about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones&#39;s shop-boy in the</li>
<li class="L2559" rel="L2559">street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to</li>
<li class="L2560" rel="L2560">Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility</li>
<li class="L2561" rel="L2561">was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane&#39;s introduction of him. She</li>
<li class="L2562" rel="L2562">received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with</li>
<li class="L2563" rel="L2563">as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous</li>
<li class="L2564" rel="L2564">acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself,</li>
<li class="L2565" rel="L2565">however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who</li>
<li class="L2566" rel="L2566">introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an</li>
<li class="L2567" rel="L2567">excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon</li>
<li class="L2568" rel="L2568">put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom,</li>
<li class="L2569" rel="L2569">however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that</li>
<li class="L2570" rel="L2570">Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a</li>
<li class="L2571" rel="L2571">lieutenant&#39;s commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the</li>
<li class="L2572" rel="L2572">last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.</li>
<li class="L2573" rel="L2573">Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the</li>
<li class="L2574" rel="L2574">occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the</li>
<li class="L2575" rel="L2575">officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid,</li>
<li class="L2576" rel="L2576">disagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses</li>
<li class="L2577" rel="L2577">the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.</li>
<li class="L2578" rel="L2578">Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn</li>
<li class="L2579" rel="L2579">would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips</li>
<li class="L2580" rel="L2580">protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery</li>
<li class="L2581" rel="L2581">tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such</li>
<li class="L2582" rel="L2582">delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.</li>
<li class="L2583" rel="L2583">Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured</li>
<li class="L2584" rel="L2584">with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.</li>
<li class="L2585" rel="L2585"></li>
<li class="L2586" rel="L2586">As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass</li>
<li class="L2587" rel="L2587">between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either</li>
<li class="L2588" rel="L2588">or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain</li>
<li class="L2589" rel="L2589">such behaviour than her sister.</li>
<li class="L2590" rel="L2590"></li>
<li class="L2591" rel="L2591">Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring</li>
<li class="L2592" rel="L2592">Mrs. Phillips&#39;s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady</li>
<li class="L2593" rel="L2593">Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman;</li>
<li class="L2594" rel="L2594">for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even</li>
<li class="L2595" rel="L2595">pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although</li>
<li class="L2596" rel="L2596">utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be</li>
<li class="L2597" rel="L2597">attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so</li>
<li class="L2598" rel="L2598">much attention in the whole course of his life.</li>
<li class="L2599" rel="L2599"></li>
<li class="L2600" rel="L2600"></li>

<li class="L2602" rel="L2602">Chapter 16</li>
<li class="L2603" rel="L2603"></li>
<li class="L2604" rel="L2604"></li>
<li class="L2605" rel="L2605">As no objection was made to the young people&#39;s engagement with their</li>
<li class="L2606" rel="L2606">aunt, and all Mr. Collins&#39;s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for</li>
<li class="L2607" rel="L2607">a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach</li>
<li class="L2608" rel="L2608">conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and</li>
<li class="L2609" rel="L2609">the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,</li>
<li class="L2610" rel="L2610">that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle&#39;s invitation, and was then in</li>
<li class="L2611" rel="L2611">the house.</li>
<li class="L2612" rel="L2612"></li>
<li class="L2613" rel="L2613">When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.</li>
<li class="L2614" rel="L2614">Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much</li>
<li class="L2615" rel="L2615">struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he</li>
<li class="L2616" rel="L2616">might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast</li>
<li class="L2617" rel="L2617">parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much</li>
<li class="L2618" rel="L2618">gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what</li>
<li class="L2619" rel="L2619">Rosings was, and who was its proprietor--when she had listened to the</li>
<li class="L2620" rel="L2620">description of only one of Lady Catherine&#39;s drawing-rooms, and found</li>
<li class="L2621" rel="L2621">that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all</li>
<li class="L2622" rel="L2622">the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison</li>
<li class="L2623" rel="L2623">with the housekeeper&#39;s room.</li>
<li class="L2624" rel="L2624"></li>
<li class="L2625" rel="L2625">In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,</li>
<li class="L2626" rel="L2626">with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and</li>
<li class="L2627" rel="L2627">the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the</li>
<li class="L2628" rel="L2628">gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive</li>
<li class="L2629" rel="L2629">listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she</li>
<li class="L2630" rel="L2630">heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as</li>
<li class="L2631" rel="L2631">soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,</li>
<li class="L2632" rel="L2632">and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine</li>
<li class="L2633" rel="L2633">their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the</li>
<li class="L2634" rel="L2634">interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.</li>
<li class="L2635" rel="L2635">The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,</li>
<li class="L2636" rel="L2636">Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking</li>
<li class="L2637" rel="L2637">of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.</li>
<li class="L2638" rel="L2638">The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,</li>
<li class="L2639" rel="L2639">gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but</li>
<li class="L2640" rel="L2640">Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and</li>
<li class="L2641" rel="L2641">walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips,</li>
<li class="L2642" rel="L2642">breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.</li>
<li class="L2643" rel="L2643"></li>
<li class="L2644" rel="L2644">Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was</li>
<li class="L2645" rel="L2645">turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated</li>
<li class="L2646" rel="L2646">himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into</li>
<li class="L2647" rel="L2647">conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel</li>
<li class="L2648" rel="L2648">that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered</li>
<li class="L2649" rel="L2649">interesting by the skill of the speaker.</li>
<li class="L2650" rel="L2650"></li>
<li class="L2651" rel="L2651">With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the</li>
<li class="L2652" rel="L2652">officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young</li>
<li class="L2653" rel="L2653">ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind</li>
<li class="L2654" rel="L2654">listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly</li>
<li class="L2655" rel="L2655">supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he</li>
<li class="L2656" rel="L2656">had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.</li>
<li class="L2657" rel="L2657"></li>
<li class="L2658" rel="L2658">“I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be glad</li>
<li class="L2659" rel="L2659">to improve myself, for in my situation in life--” Mrs. Phillips was very</li>
<li class="L2660" rel="L2660">glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.</li>
<li class="L2661" rel="L2661"></li>
<li class="L2662" rel="L2662">Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he</li>
<li class="L2663" rel="L2663">received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there</li>
<li class="L2664" rel="L2664">seemed danger of Lydia&#39;s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most</li>
<li class="L2665" rel="L2665">determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,</li>
<li class="L2666" rel="L2666">she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets</li>
<li class="L2667" rel="L2667">and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.</li>
<li class="L2668" rel="L2668">Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore</li>
<li class="L2669" rel="L2669">at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear</li>
<li class="L2670" rel="L2670">him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be</li>
<li class="L2671" rel="L2671">told--the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not</li>
<li class="L2672" rel="L2672">even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly</li>
<li class="L2673" rel="L2673">relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far</li>
<li class="L2674" rel="L2674">Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in</li>
<li class="L2675" rel="L2675">a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.</li>
<li class="L2676" rel="L2676"></li>
<li class="L2677" rel="L2677">“About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject</li>
<li class="L2678" rel="L2678">drop, added, “He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I</li>
<li class="L2679" rel="L2679">understand.”</li>
<li class="L2680" rel="L2680"></li>
<li class="L2681" rel="L2681">“Yes,” replied Mr. Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. A clear</li>
<li class="L2682" rel="L2682">ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more</li>
<li class="L2683" rel="L2683">capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for</li>
<li class="L2684" rel="L2684">I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my</li>
<li class="L2685" rel="L2685">infancy.”</li>
<li class="L2686" rel="L2686"></li>
<li class="L2687" rel="L2687">Elizabeth could not but look surprised.</li>
<li class="L2688" rel="L2688"></li>
<li class="L2689" rel="L2689">“You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after</li>
<li class="L2690" rel="L2690">seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting</li>
<li class="L2691" rel="L2691">yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”</li>
<li class="L2692" rel="L2692"></li>
<li class="L2693" rel="L2693">“As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth very warmly. “I have</li>
<li class="L2694" rel="L2694">spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very</li>
<li class="L2695" rel="L2695">disagreeable.”</li>
<li class="L2696" rel="L2696"></li>
<li class="L2697" rel="L2697">“I have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being</li>
<li class="L2698" rel="L2698">agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him</li>
<li class="L2699" rel="L2699">too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_</li>
<li class="L2700" rel="L2700">to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general</li>
<li class="L2701" rel="L2701">astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly</li>
<li class="L2702" rel="L2702">anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.”</li>
<li class="L2703" rel="L2703"></li>
<li class="L2704" rel="L2704">“Upon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in</li>
<li class="L2705" rel="L2705">the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in</li>
<li class="L2706" rel="L2706">Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find</li>
<li class="L2707" rel="L2707">him more favourably spoken of by anyone.”</li>
<li class="L2708" rel="L2708"></li>
<li class="L2709" rel="L2709">“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short</li>
<li class="L2710" rel="L2710">interruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond</li>
<li class="L2711" rel="L2711">their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The</li>
<li class="L2712" rel="L2712">world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his</li>
<li class="L2713" rel="L2713">high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”</li>
<li class="L2714" rel="L2714"></li>
<li class="L2715" rel="L2715">“I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an</li>
<li class="L2716" rel="L2716">ill-tempered man.” Wickham only shook his head.</li>
<li class="L2717" rel="L2717"></li>
<li class="L2718" rel="L2718">“I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is</li>
<li class="L2719" rel="L2719">likely to be in this country much longer.”</li>
<li class="L2720" rel="L2720"></li>
<li class="L2721" rel="L2721">“I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I</li>
<li class="L2722" rel="L2722">was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will</li>
<li class="L2723" rel="L2723">not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”</li>
<li class="L2724" rel="L2724"></li>
<li class="L2725" rel="L2725">“Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_</li>
<li class="L2726" rel="L2726">wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,</li>
<li class="L2727" rel="L2727">and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for</li>
<li class="L2728" rel="L2728">avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense</li>
<li class="L2729" rel="L2729">of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he</li>
<li class="L2730" rel="L2730">is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men</li>
<li class="L2731" rel="L2731">that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never</li>
<li class="L2732" rel="L2732">be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by</li>
<li class="L2733" rel="L2733">a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been</li>
<li class="L2734" rel="L2734">scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and</li>
<li class="L2735" rel="L2735">everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the</li>
<li class="L2736" rel="L2736">memory of his father.”</li>
<li class="L2737" rel="L2737"></li>
<li class="L2738" rel="L2738">Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with</li>
<li class="L2739" rel="L2739">all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.</li>
<li class="L2740" rel="L2740"></li>
<li class="L2741" rel="L2741">Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the</li>
<li class="L2742" rel="L2742">neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that</li>
<li class="L2743" rel="L2743">he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very</li>
<li class="L2744" rel="L2744">intelligible gallantry.</li>
<li class="L2745" rel="L2745"></li>
<li class="L2746" rel="L2746">“It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added,</li>
<li class="L2747" rel="L2747">“which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to be</li>
<li class="L2748" rel="L2748">a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me</li>
<li class="L2749" rel="L2749">further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great</li>
<li class="L2750" rel="L2750">attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them.</li>
<li class="L2751" rel="L2751">Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and</li>
<li class="L2752" rel="L2752">my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.</li>
<li class="L2753" rel="L2753">A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have</li>
<li class="L2754" rel="L2754">now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I</li>
<li class="L2755" rel="L2755">was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in</li>
<li class="L2756" rel="L2756">possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we</li>
<li class="L2757" rel="L2757">were speaking of just now.”</li>
<li class="L2758" rel="L2758"></li>
<li class="L2759" rel="L2759">“Indeed!”</li>
<li class="L2760" rel="L2760"></li>
<li class="L2761" rel="L2761">“Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best</li>
<li class="L2762" rel="L2762">living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.</li>
<li class="L2763" rel="L2763">I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,</li>
<li class="L2764" rel="L2764">and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given</li>
<li class="L2765" rel="L2765">elsewhere.”</li>
<li class="L2766" rel="L2766"></li>
<li class="L2767" rel="L2767">“Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? How could his</li>
<li class="L2768" rel="L2768">will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?”</li>
<li class="L2769" rel="L2769"></li>
<li class="L2770" rel="L2770">“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to</li>
<li class="L2771" rel="L2771">give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the</li>
<li class="L2772" rel="L2772">intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely</li>
<li class="L2773" rel="L2773">conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim</li>
<li class="L2774" rel="L2774">to it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing. Certain</li>
<li class="L2775" rel="L2775">it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was</li>
<li class="L2776" rel="L2776">of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no</li>
<li class="L2777" rel="L2777">less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done</li>
<li class="L2778" rel="L2778">anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and</li>
<li class="L2779" rel="L2779">I may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely. I can</li>
<li class="L2780" rel="L2780">recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort</li>
<li class="L2781" rel="L2781">of men, and that he hates me.”</li>
<li class="L2782" rel="L2782"></li>
<li class="L2783" rel="L2783">“This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”</li>
<li class="L2784" rel="L2784"></li>
<li class="L2785" rel="L2785">“Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I</li>
<li class="L2786" rel="L2786">can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”</li>
<li class="L2787" rel="L2787"></li>
<li class="L2788" rel="L2788">Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than</li>
<li class="L2789" rel="L2789">ever as he expressed them.</li>
<li class="L2790" rel="L2790"></li>
<li class="L2791" rel="L2791">“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive? What can</li>
<li class="L2792" rel="L2792">have induced him to behave so cruelly?”</li>
<li class="L2793" rel="L2793"></li>
<li class="L2794" rel="L2794">“A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but</li>
<li class="L2795" rel="L2795">attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me</li>
<li class="L2796" rel="L2796">less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father&#39;s uncommon</li>
<li class="L2797" rel="L2797">attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had</li>
<li class="L2798" rel="L2798">not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort</li>
<li class="L2799" rel="L2799">of preference which was often given me.”</li>
<li class="L2800" rel="L2800"></li>
<li class="L2801" rel="L2801">“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked</li>
<li class="L2802" rel="L2802">him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be</li>
<li class="L2803" rel="L2803">despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of</li>
<li class="L2804" rel="L2804">descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as</li>
<li class="L2805" rel="L2805">this.”</li>
<li class="L2806" rel="L2806"></li>
<li class="L2807" rel="L2807">After a few minutes&#39; reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_</li>
<li class="L2808" rel="L2808">remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of</li>
<li class="L2809" rel="L2809">his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition</li>
<li class="L2810" rel="L2810">must be dreadful.”</li>
<li class="L2811" rel="L2811"></li>
<li class="L2812" rel="L2812">“I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “I can hardly</li>
<li class="L2813" rel="L2813">be just to him.”</li>
<li class="L2814" rel="L2814"></li>
<li class="L2815" rel="L2815">Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To</li>
<li class="L2816" rel="L2816">treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his</li>
<li class="L2817" rel="L2817">father!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like _you_, whose very</li>
<li class="L2818" rel="L2818">countenance may vouch for your being amiable”--but she contented herself</li>
<li class="L2819" rel="L2819">with, “and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood,</li>
<li class="L2820" rel="L2820">connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!”</li>
<li class="L2821" rel="L2821"></li>
<li class="L2822" rel="L2822">“We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest</li>
<li class="L2823" rel="L2823">part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,</li>
<li class="L2824" rel="L2824">sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_</li>
<li class="L2825" rel="L2825">father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips,</li>
<li class="L2826" rel="L2826">appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up everything to be of</li>
<li class="L2827" rel="L2827">use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the</li>
<li class="L2828" rel="L2828">Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most</li>
<li class="L2829" rel="L2829">intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to</li>
<li class="L2830" rel="L2830">be under the greatest obligations to my father&#39;s active superintendence,</li>
<li class="L2831" rel="L2831">and when, immediately before my father&#39;s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a</li>
<li class="L2832" rel="L2832">voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to</li>
<li class="L2833" rel="L2833">be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his affection to myself.”</li>
<li class="L2834" rel="L2834"></li>
<li class="L2835" rel="L2835">“How strange!” cried Elizabeth. “How abominable! I wonder that the very</li>
<li class="L2836" rel="L2836">pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better</li>
<li class="L2837" rel="L2837">motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest--for</li>
<li class="L2838" rel="L2838">dishonesty I must call it.”</li>
<li class="L2839" rel="L2839"></li>
<li class="L2840" rel="L2840">“It _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham, “for almost all his actions may</li>
<li class="L2841" rel="L2841">be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has</li>
<li class="L2842" rel="L2842">connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are</li>
<li class="L2843" rel="L2843">none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger</li>
<li class="L2844" rel="L2844">impulses even than pride.”</li>
<li class="L2845" rel="L2845"></li>
<li class="L2846" rel="L2846">“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”</li>
<li class="L2847" rel="L2847"></li>
<li class="L2848" rel="L2848">“Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money</li>
<li class="L2849" rel="L2849">freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the</li>
<li class="L2850" rel="L2850">poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride--for he is very proud of what</li>
<li class="L2851" rel="L2851">his father was--have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family,</li>
<li class="L2852" rel="L2852">to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the</li>
<li class="L2853" rel="L2853">Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,</li>
<li class="L2854" rel="L2854">which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and</li>
<li class="L2855" rel="L2855">careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up</li>
<li class="L2856" rel="L2856">as the most attentive and best of brothers.”</li>
<li class="L2857" rel="L2857"></li>
<li class="L2858" rel="L2858">“What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?”</li>
<li class="L2859" rel="L2859"></li>
<li class="L2860" rel="L2860">He shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to</li>
<li class="L2861" rel="L2861">speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother--very, very</li>
<li class="L2862" rel="L2862">proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond</li>
<li class="L2863" rel="L2863">of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is</li>
<li class="L2864" rel="L2864">nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,</li>
<li class="L2865" rel="L2865">and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father&#39;s death, her</li>
<li class="L2866" rel="L2866">home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her</li>
<li class="L2867" rel="L2867">education.”</li>
<li class="L2868" rel="L2868"></li>
<li class="L2869" rel="L2869">After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not</li>
<li class="L2870" rel="L2870">help reverting once more to the first, and saying:</li>
<li class="L2871" rel="L2871"></li>
<li class="L2872" rel="L2872">“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,</li>
<li class="L2873" rel="L2873">who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,</li>
<li class="L2874" rel="L2874">be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you</li>
<li class="L2875" rel="L2875">know Mr. Bingley?”</li>
<li class="L2876" rel="L2876"></li>
<li class="L2877" rel="L2877">“Not at all.”</li>
<li class="L2878" rel="L2878"></li>
<li class="L2879" rel="L2879">“He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.</li>
<li class="L2880" rel="L2880">Darcy is.”</li>
<li class="L2881" rel="L2881"></li>
<li class="L2882" rel="L2882">“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not</li>
<li class="L2883" rel="L2883">want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth</li>
<li class="L2884" rel="L2884">his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is</li>
<li class="L2885" rel="L2885">a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His</li>
<li class="L2886" rel="L2886">pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,</li>
<li class="L2887" rel="L2887">sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing something</li>
<li class="L2888" rel="L2888">for fortune and figure.”</li>
<li class="L2889" rel="L2889"></li>
<li class="L2890" rel="L2890">The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round</li>
<li class="L2891" rel="L2891">the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin</li>
<li class="L2892" rel="L2892">Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success were</li>
<li class="L2893" rel="L2893">made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every</li>
<li class="L2894" rel="L2894">point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon,</li>
<li class="L2895" rel="L2895">he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least</li>
<li class="L2896" rel="L2896">importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged</li>
<li class="L2897" rel="L2897">that she would not make herself uneasy.</li>
<li class="L2898" rel="L2898"></li>
<li class="L2899" rel="L2899">“I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a</li>
<li class="L2900" rel="L2900">card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I</li>
<li class="L2901" rel="L2901">am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There</li>
<li class="L2902" rel="L2902">are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady</li>
<li class="L2903" rel="L2903">Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding</li>
<li class="L2904" rel="L2904">little matters.”</li>
<li class="L2905" rel="L2905"></li>
<li class="L2906" rel="L2906">Mr. Wickham&#39;s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for</li>
<li class="L2907" rel="L2907">a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation</li>
<li class="L2908" rel="L2908">was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.</li>
<li class="L2909" rel="L2909"></li>
<li class="L2910" rel="L2910">“Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him</li>
<li class="L2911" rel="L2911">a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her</li>
<li class="L2912" rel="L2912">notice, but he certainly has not known her long.”</li>
<li class="L2913" rel="L2913"></li>
<li class="L2914" rel="L2914">“You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy</li>
<li class="L2915" rel="L2915">were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.”</li>
<li class="L2916" rel="L2916"></li>
<li class="L2917" rel="L2917">“No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine&#39;s</li>
<li class="L2918" rel="L2918">connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before</li>
<li class="L2919" rel="L2919">yesterday.”</li>
<li class="L2920" rel="L2920"></li>
<li class="L2921" rel="L2921">“Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is</li>
<li class="L2922" rel="L2922">believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”</li>
<li class="L2923" rel="L2923"></li>
<li class="L2924" rel="L2924">This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss</li>
<li class="L2925" rel="L2925">Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her</li>
<li class="L2926" rel="L2926">affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already</li>
<li class="L2927" rel="L2927">self-destined for another.</li>
<li class="L2928" rel="L2928"></li>
<li class="L2929" rel="L2929">“Mr. Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her</li>
<li class="L2930" rel="L2930">daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,</li>
<li class="L2931" rel="L2931">I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his</li>
<li class="L2932" rel="L2932">patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”</li>
<li class="L2933" rel="L2933"></li>
<li class="L2934" rel="L2934">“I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I have</li>
<li class="L2935" rel="L2935">not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked</li>
<li class="L2936" rel="L2936">her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the</li>
<li class="L2937" rel="L2937">reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe</li>
<li class="L2938" rel="L2938">she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from</li>
<li class="L2939" rel="L2939">her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her</li>
<li class="L2940" rel="L2940">nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an</li>
<li class="L2941" rel="L2941">understanding of the first class.”</li>
<li class="L2942" rel="L2942"></li>
<li class="L2943" rel="L2943">Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and</li>
<li class="L2944" rel="L2944">they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper</li>
<li class="L2945" rel="L2945">put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.</li>
<li class="L2946" rel="L2946">Wickham&#39;s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise</li>
<li class="L2947" rel="L2947">of Mrs. Phillips&#39;s supper party, but his manners recommended him to</li>
<li class="L2948" rel="L2948">everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done</li>
<li class="L2949" rel="L2949">gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could</li>
<li class="L2950" rel="L2950">think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all</li>
<li class="L2951" rel="L2951">the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name</li>
<li class="L2952" rel="L2952">as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia</li>
<li class="L2953" rel="L2953">talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the</li>
<li class="L2954" rel="L2954">fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and</li>
<li class="L2955" rel="L2955">Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses</li>
<li class="L2956" rel="L2956">at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing</li>
<li class="L2957" rel="L2957">that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage</li>
<li class="L2958" rel="L2958">before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.</li>
<li class="L2959" rel="L2959"></li>
<li class="L2960" rel="L2960"></li>
<li class="L2961" rel="L2961"></li>
<li class="L2962" rel="L2962">Chapter 17</li>
<li class="L2963" rel="L2963"></li>
<li class="L2964" rel="L2964"></li>
<li class="L2965" rel="L2965">Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr.</li>
<li class="L2966" rel="L2966">Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she</li>
<li class="L2967" rel="L2967">knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.</li>
<li class="L2968" rel="L2968">Bingley&#39;s regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the</li>
<li class="L2969" rel="L2969">veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The</li>
<li class="L2970" rel="L2970">possibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to</li>
<li class="L2971" rel="L2971">interest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be</li>
<li class="L2972" rel="L2972">done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each,</li>
<li class="L2973" rel="L2973">and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be</li>
<li class="L2974" rel="L2974">otherwise explained.</li>
<li class="L2975" rel="L2975"></li>
<li class="L2976" rel="L2976">“They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some way</li>
<li class="L2977" rel="L2977">or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps</li>
<li class="L2978" rel="L2978">misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to</li>
<li class="L2979" rel="L2979">conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,</li>
<li class="L2980" rel="L2980">without actual blame on either side.”</li>
<li class="L2981" rel="L2981"></li>
<li class="L2982" rel="L2982">“Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on</li>
<li class="L2983" rel="L2983">behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the</li>
<li class="L2984" rel="L2984">business? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of</li>
<li class="L2985" rel="L2985">somebody.”</li>
<li class="L2986" rel="L2986"></li>
<li class="L2987" rel="L2987">“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my</li>
<li class="L2988" rel="L2988">opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light</li>
<li class="L2989" rel="L2989">it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father&#39;s favourite in such</li>
<li class="L2990" rel="L2990">a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is</li>
<li class="L2991" rel="L2991">impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his</li>
<li class="L2992" rel="L2992">character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so</li>
<li class="L2993" rel="L2993">excessively deceived in him? Oh! no.”</li>
<li class="L2994" rel="L2994"></li>
<li class="L2995" rel="L2995">“I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley&#39;s being imposed on, than</li>
<li class="L2996" rel="L2996">that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me</li>
<li class="L2997" rel="L2997">last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it</li>
<li class="L2998" rel="L2998">be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his</li>
<li class="L2999" rel="L2999">looks.”</li>
<li class="L3000" rel="L3000"></li>
<li class="L3001" rel="L3001">“It is difficult indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to</li>
<li class="L3002" rel="L3002">think.”</li>
<li class="L3003" rel="L3003"></li>
<li class="L3004" rel="L3004">“I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.”</li>
<li class="L3005" rel="L3005"></li>
<li class="L3006" rel="L3006">But Jane could think with certainty on only one point--that Mr. Bingley,</li>
<li class="L3007" rel="L3007">if he _had_ been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair</li>
<li class="L3008" rel="L3008">became public.</li>
<li class="L3009" rel="L3009"></li>
<li class="L3010" rel="L3010">The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this</li>
<li class="L3011" rel="L3011">conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had</li>
<li class="L3012" rel="L3012">been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal</li>
<li class="L3013" rel="L3013">invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed</li>
<li class="L3014" rel="L3014">for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their</li>
<li class="L3015" rel="L3015">dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly</li>
<li class="L3016" rel="L3016">asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To</li>
<li class="L3017" rel="L3017">the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet</li>
<li class="L3018" rel="L3018">as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to</li>
<li class="L3019" rel="L3019">the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an</li>
<li class="L3020" rel="L3020">activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if</li>
<li class="L3021" rel="L3021">eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet&#39;s civilities.</li>
<li class="L3022" rel="L3022"></li>
<li class="L3023" rel="L3023">The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every</li>
<li class="L3024" rel="L3024">female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in</li>
<li class="L3025" rel="L3025">compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered</li>
<li class="L3026" rel="L3026">by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a</li>
<li class="L3027" rel="L3027">ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the</li>
<li class="L3028" rel="L3028">society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and</li>
<li class="L3029" rel="L3029">Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.</li>
<li class="L3030" rel="L3030">Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy&#39;s look</li>
<li class="L3031" rel="L3031">and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended</li>
<li class="L3032" rel="L3032">less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they</li>
<li class="L3033" rel="L3033">each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,</li>
<li class="L3034" rel="L3034">he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball</li>
<li class="L3035" rel="L3035">was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she</li>
<li class="L3036" rel="L3036">had no disinclination for it.</li>
<li class="L3037" rel="L3037"></li>
<li class="L3038" rel="L3038">“While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough--I</li>
<li class="L3039" rel="L3039">think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.</li>
<li class="L3040" rel="L3040">Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those</li>
<li class="L3041" rel="L3041">who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for</li>
<li class="L3042" rel="L3042">everybody.”</li>
<li class="L3043" rel="L3043"></li>
<li class="L3044" rel="L3044">Elizabeth&#39;s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did</li>
<li class="L3045" rel="L3045">not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking</li>
<li class="L3046" rel="L3046">him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley&#39;s invitation, and if</li>
<li class="L3047" rel="L3047">he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening&#39;s</li>
<li class="L3048" rel="L3048">amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no</li>
<li class="L3049" rel="L3049">scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke</li>
<li class="L3050" rel="L3050">either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to</li>
<li class="L3051" rel="L3051">dance.</li>
<li class="L3052" rel="L3052"></li>
<li class="L3053" rel="L3053">“I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball</li>
<li class="L3054" rel="L3054">of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people,</li>
<li class="L3055" rel="L3055">can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing</li>
<li class="L3056" rel="L3056">myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair</li>
<li class="L3057" rel="L3057">cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of</li>
<li class="L3058" rel="L3058">soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,</li>
<li class="L3059" rel="L3059">a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right</li>
<li class="L3060" rel="L3060">cause, and not to any disrespect for her.”</li>
<li class="L3061" rel="L3061"></li>
<li class="L3062" rel="L3062">Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being</li>
<li class="L3063" rel="L3063">engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins</li>
<li class="L3064" rel="L3064">instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help</li>
<li class="L3065" rel="L3065">for it, however. Mr. Wickham&#39;s happiness and her own were perforce</li>
<li class="L3066" rel="L3066">delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins&#39;s proposal accepted with as</li>
<li class="L3067" rel="L3067">good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his</li>
<li class="L3068" rel="L3068">gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first</li>
<li class="L3069" rel="L3069">struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy</li>
<li class="L3070" rel="L3070">of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a</li>
<li class="L3071" rel="L3071">quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.</li>
<li class="L3072" rel="L3072">The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing</li>
<li class="L3073" rel="L3073">civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a</li>
<li class="L3074" rel="L3074">compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than</li>
<li class="L3075" rel="L3075">gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before</li>
<li class="L3076" rel="L3076">her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage</li>
<li class="L3077" rel="L3077">was extremely agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose</li>
<li class="L3078" rel="L3078">to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the</li>
<li class="L3079" rel="L3079">consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and</li>
<li class="L3080" rel="L3080">till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.</li>
<li class="L3081" rel="L3081"></li>
<li class="L3082" rel="L3082">If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the</li>
<li class="L3083" rel="L3083">younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this</li>
<li class="L3084" rel="L3084">time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there</li>
<li class="L3085" rel="L3085">was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton</li>
<li class="L3086" rel="L3086">once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after--the very</li>
<li class="L3087" rel="L3087">shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have</li>
<li class="L3088" rel="L3088">found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the</li>
<li class="L3089" rel="L3089">improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than</li>
<li class="L3090" rel="L3090">a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and</li>
<li class="L3091" rel="L3091">Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.</li>
<li class="L3092" rel="L3092"></li>
<li class="L3093" rel="L3093"></li>
<li class="L3094" rel="L3094"></li>
<li class="L3095" rel="L3095">Chapter 18</li>
<li class="L3096" rel="L3096"></li>
<li class="L3097" rel="L3097"></li>
<li class="L3098" rel="L3098">Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in</li>
<li class="L3099" rel="L3099">vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a</li>
<li class="L3100" rel="L3100">doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty</li>
<li class="L3101" rel="L3101">of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that</li>
<li class="L3102" rel="L3102">might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than</li>
<li class="L3103" rel="L3103">usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all</li>
<li class="L3104" rel="L3104">that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than</li>
<li class="L3105" rel="L3105">might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose</li>
<li class="L3106" rel="L3106">the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy&#39;s</li>
<li class="L3107" rel="L3107">pleasure in the Bingleys&#39; invitation to the officers; and though</li>
<li class="L3108" rel="L3108">this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was</li>
<li class="L3109" rel="L3109">pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who</li>
<li class="L3110" rel="L3110">told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the</li>
<li class="L3111" rel="L3111">day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,</li>
<li class="L3112" rel="L3112">“I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if</li>
<li class="L3113" rel="L3113">he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.”</li>
<li class="L3114" rel="L3114"></li>
<li class="L3115" rel="L3115">This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by</li>
<li class="L3116" rel="L3116">Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for</li>
<li class="L3117" rel="L3117">Wickham&#39;s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every</li>
<li class="L3118" rel="L3118">feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate</li>
<li class="L3119" rel="L3119">disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to</li>
<li class="L3120" rel="L3120">the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.</li>
<li class="L3121" rel="L3121">Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She</li>
<li class="L3122" rel="L3122">was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away</li>
<li class="L3123" rel="L3123">with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in</li>
<li class="L3124" rel="L3124">speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.</li>
<li class="L3125" rel="L3125"></li>
<li class="L3126" rel="L3126">But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect</li>
<li class="L3127" rel="L3127">of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her</li>
<li class="L3128" rel="L3128">spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had</li>
<li class="L3129" rel="L3129">not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition</li>
<li class="L3130" rel="L3130">to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular</li>
<li class="L3131" rel="L3131">notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress;</li>
<li class="L3132" rel="L3132">they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,</li>
<li class="L3133" rel="L3133">apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being</li>
<li class="L3134" rel="L3134">aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable</li>
<li class="L3135" rel="L3135">partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from</li>
<li class="L3136" rel="L3136">him was ecstasy.</li>
<li class="L3137" rel="L3137"></li>
<li class="L3138" rel="L3138">She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of</li>
<li class="L3139" rel="L3139">Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances</li>
<li class="L3140" rel="L3140">were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with</li>
<li class="L3141" rel="L3141">her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took</li>
<li class="L3142" rel="L3142">her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that,</li>
<li class="L3143" rel="L3143">without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again</li>
<li class="L3144" rel="L3144">immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of</li>
<li class="L3145" rel="L3145">mind; Charlotte tried to console her:</li>
<li class="L3146" rel="L3146"></li>
<li class="L3147" rel="L3147">“I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”</li>
<li class="L3148" rel="L3148"></li>
<li class="L3149" rel="L3149">“Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find</li>
<li class="L3150" rel="L3150">a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an</li>
<li class="L3151" rel="L3151">evil.”</li>
<li class="L3152" rel="L3152"></li>
<li class="L3153" rel="L3153">When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her</li>
<li class="L3154" rel="L3154">hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a</li>
<li class="L3155" rel="L3155">simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant</li>
<li class="L3156" rel="L3156">in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no</li>
<li class="L3157" rel="L3157">answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which</li>
<li class="L3158" rel="L3158">she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and</li>
<li class="L3159" rel="L3159">reading in her neighbours&#39; looks, their equal amazement in beholding</li>
<li class="L3160" rel="L3160">it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to</li>
<li class="L3161" rel="L3161">imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at</li>
<li class="L3162" rel="L3162">first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would</li>
<li class="L3163" rel="L3163">be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made</li>
<li class="L3164" rel="L3164">some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again</li>
<li class="L3165" rel="L3165">silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time</li>
<li class="L3166" rel="L3166">with:--“It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked</li>
<li class="L3167" rel="L3167">about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size</li>
<li class="L3168" rel="L3168">of the room, or the number of couples.”</li>
<li class="L3169" rel="L3169"></li>
<li class="L3170" rel="L3170">He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be</li>
<li class="L3171" rel="L3171">said.</li>
<li class="L3172" rel="L3172"></li>
<li class="L3173" rel="L3173">“Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may</li>
<li class="L3174" rel="L3174">observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But</li>
<li class="L3175" rel="L3175">_now_ we may be silent.”</li>
<li class="L3176" rel="L3176"></li>
<li class="L3177" rel="L3177">“Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”</li>
<li class="L3178" rel="L3178"></li>
<li class="L3179" rel="L3179">“Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be</li>
<li class="L3180" rel="L3180">entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of</li>
<li class="L3181" rel="L3181">_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the</li>
<li class="L3182" rel="L3182">trouble of saying as little as possible.”</li>
<li class="L3183" rel="L3183"></li>
<li class="L3184" rel="L3184">“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you</li>
<li class="L3185" rel="L3185">imagine that you are gratifying mine?”</li>
<li class="L3186" rel="L3186"></li>
<li class="L3187" rel="L3187">“Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great</li>
<li class="L3188" rel="L3188">similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,</li>
<li class="L3189" rel="L3189">taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say</li>
<li class="L3190" rel="L3190">something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to</li>
<li class="L3191" rel="L3191">posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.”</li>
<li class="L3192" rel="L3192"></li>
<li class="L3193" rel="L3193">“This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,”</li>
<li class="L3194" rel="L3194"> said he. “How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_</li>
<li class="L3195" rel="L3195">think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.”</li>
<li class="L3196" rel="L3196"></li>
<li class="L3197" rel="L3197">“I must not decide on my own performance.”</li>
<li class="L3198" rel="L3198"></li>
<li class="L3199" rel="L3199">He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down</li>
<li class="L3200" rel="L3200">the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often</li>
<li class="L3201" rel="L3201">walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist</li>
<li class="L3202" rel="L3202">the temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just</li>
<li class="L3203" rel="L3203">been forming a new acquaintance.”</li>
<li class="L3204" rel="L3204"></li>
<li class="L3205" rel="L3205">The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his</li>
<li class="L3206" rel="L3206">features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself</li>
<li class="L3207" rel="L3207">for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a</li>
<li class="L3208" rel="L3208">constrained manner said, “Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners</li>
<li class="L3209" rel="L3209">as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of</li>
<li class="L3210" rel="L3210">_retaining_ them, is less certain.”</li>
<li class="L3211" rel="L3211"></li>
<li class="L3212" rel="L3212">“He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,” replied Elizabeth</li>
<li class="L3213" rel="L3213">with emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all</li>
<li class="L3214" rel="L3214">his life.”</li>
<li class="L3215" rel="L3215"></li>
<li class="L3216" rel="L3216">Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At</li>
<li class="L3217" rel="L3217">that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass</li>
<li class="L3218" rel="L3218">through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.</li>
<li class="L3219" rel="L3219">Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on</li>
<li class="L3220" rel="L3220">his dancing and his partner.</li>
<li class="L3221" rel="L3221"></li>
<li class="L3222" rel="L3222">“I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very</li>
<li class="L3223" rel="L3223">superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the</li>
<li class="L3224" rel="L3224">first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not</li>
<li class="L3225" rel="L3225">disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,</li>
<li class="L3226" rel="L3226">especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at</li>
<li class="L3227" rel="L3227">her sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then</li>
<li class="L3228" rel="L3228">flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir. You</li>
<li class="L3229" rel="L3229">will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that</li>
<li class="L3230" rel="L3230">young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”</li>
<li class="L3231" rel="L3231"></li>
<li class="L3232" rel="L3232">The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir</li>
<li class="L3233" rel="L3233">William&#39;s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his</li>
<li class="L3234" rel="L3234">eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and</li>
<li class="L3235" rel="L3235">Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,</li>
<li class="L3236" rel="L3236">he turned to his partner, and said, “Sir William&#39;s interruption has made</li>
<li class="L3237" rel="L3237">me forget what we were talking of.”</li>
<li class="L3238" rel="L3238"></li>
<li class="L3239" rel="L3239">“I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have</li>
<li class="L3240" rel="L3240">interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.</li>
<li class="L3241" rel="L3241">We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we</li>
<li class="L3242" rel="L3242">are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”</li>
<li class="L3243" rel="L3243"></li>
<li class="L3244" rel="L3244">“What think you of books?” said he, smiling.</li>
<li class="L3245" rel="L3245"></li>
<li class="L3246" rel="L3246">“Books--oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same</li>
<li class="L3247" rel="L3247">feelings.”</li>
<li class="L3248" rel="L3248"></li>
<li class="L3249" rel="L3249">“I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be</li>
<li class="L3250" rel="L3250">no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.”</li>
<li class="L3251" rel="L3251"></li>
<li class="L3252" rel="L3252">“No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of</li>
<li class="L3253" rel="L3253">something else.”</li>
<li class="L3254" rel="L3254"></li>
<li class="L3255" rel="L3255">“The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he,</li>
<li class="L3256" rel="L3256">with a look of doubt.</li>
<li class="L3257" rel="L3257"></li>
<li class="L3258" rel="L3258">“Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said, for her</li>
<li class="L3259" rel="L3259">thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared</li>
<li class="L3260" rel="L3260">by her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,</li>
<li class="L3261" rel="L3261">that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was</li>
<li class="L3262" rel="L3262">unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being</li>
<li class="L3263" rel="L3263">created_.”</li>
<li class="L3264" rel="L3264"></li>
<li class="L3265" rel="L3265">“I am,” said he, with a firm voice.</li>
<li class="L3266" rel="L3266"></li>
<li class="L3267" rel="L3267">“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”</li>
<li class="L3268" rel="L3268"></li>
<li class="L3269" rel="L3269">“I hope not.”</li>
<li class="L3270" rel="L3270"></li>
<li class="L3271" rel="L3271">“It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,</li>
<li class="L3272" rel="L3272">to be secure of judging properly at first.”</li>
<li class="L3273" rel="L3273"></li>
<li class="L3274" rel="L3274">“May I ask to what these questions tend?”</li>
<li class="L3275" rel="L3275"></li>
<li class="L3276" rel="L3276">“Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring</li>
<li class="L3277" rel="L3277">to shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it out.”</li>
<li class="L3278" rel="L3278"></li>
<li class="L3279" rel="L3279">“And what is your success?”</li>
<li class="L3280" rel="L3280"></li>
<li class="L3281" rel="L3281">She shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such different</li>
<li class="L3282" rel="L3282">accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”</li>
<li class="L3283" rel="L3283"></li>
<li class="L3284" rel="L3284">“I can readily believe,” answered he gravely, “that reports may vary</li>
<li class="L3285" rel="L3285">greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were</li>
<li class="L3286" rel="L3286">not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to</li>
<li class="L3287" rel="L3287">fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”</li>
<li class="L3288" rel="L3288"></li>
<li class="L3289" rel="L3289">“But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another</li>
<li class="L3290" rel="L3290">opportunity.”</li>
<li class="L3291" rel="L3291"></li>
<li class="L3292" rel="L3292">“I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.</li>
<li class="L3293" rel="L3293">She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in</li>
<li class="L3294" rel="L3294">silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree,</li>
<li class="L3295" rel="L3295">for in Darcy&#39;s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards</li>
<li class="L3296" rel="L3296">her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against</li>
<li class="L3297" rel="L3297">another.</li>
<li class="L3298" rel="L3298"></li>
<li class="L3299" rel="L3299">They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and</li>
<li class="L3300" rel="L3300">with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:</li>
<li class="L3301" rel="L3301"></li>
<li class="L3302" rel="L3302">“So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!</li>
<li class="L3303" rel="L3303">Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand</li>
<li class="L3304" rel="L3304">questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among</li>
<li class="L3305" rel="L3305">his other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late</li>
<li class="L3306" rel="L3306">Mr. Darcy&#39;s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to</li>
<li class="L3307" rel="L3307">give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy&#39;s</li>
<li class="L3308" rel="L3308">using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has</li>
<li class="L3309" rel="L3309">always been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated</li>
<li class="L3310" rel="L3310">Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but</li>
<li class="L3311" rel="L3311">I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he</li>
<li class="L3312" rel="L3312">cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother</li>
<li class="L3313" rel="L3313">thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to</li>
<li class="L3314" rel="L3314">the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself</li>
<li class="L3315" rel="L3315">out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent</li>
<li class="L3316" rel="L3316">thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,</li>
<li class="L3317" rel="L3317">Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite&#39;s guilt; but really,</li>
<li class="L3318" rel="L3318">considering his descent, one could not expect much better.”</li>
<li class="L3319" rel="L3319"></li>
<li class="L3320" rel="L3320">“His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,” said</li>
<li class="L3321" rel="L3321">Elizabeth angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse</li>
<li class="L3322" rel="L3322">than of being the son of Mr. Darcy&#39;s steward, and of _that_, I can</li>
<li class="L3323" rel="L3323">assure you, he informed me himself.”</li>
<li class="L3324" rel="L3324"></li>
<li class="L3325" rel="L3325">“I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.</li>
<li class="L3326" rel="L3326">“Excuse my interference--it was kindly meant.”</li>
<li class="L3327" rel="L3327"></li>
<li class="L3328" rel="L3328">“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much mistaken</li>
<li class="L3329" rel="L3329">if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see</li>
<li class="L3330" rel="L3330">nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.</li>
<li class="L3331" rel="L3331">Darcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make</li>
<li class="L3332" rel="L3332">inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of</li>
<li class="L3333" rel="L3333">such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently</li>
<li class="L3334" rel="L3334">marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.</li>
<li class="L3335" rel="L3335">Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for</li>
<li class="L3336" rel="L3336">Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way</li>
<li class="L3337" rel="L3337">before the hope of Jane&#39;s being in the fairest way for happiness.</li>
<li class="L3338" rel="L3338"></li>
<li class="L3339" rel="L3339">“I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her</li>
<li class="L3340" rel="L3340">sister&#39;s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have</li>
<li class="L3341" rel="L3341">been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case</li>
<li class="L3342" rel="L3342">you may be sure of my pardon.”</li>
<li class="L3343" rel="L3343"></li>
<li class="L3344" rel="L3344">“No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing</li>
<li class="L3345" rel="L3345">satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of</li>
<li class="L3346" rel="L3346">his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have</li>
<li class="L3347" rel="L3347">principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,</li>
<li class="L3348" rel="L3348">the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that</li>
<li class="L3349" rel="L3349">Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has</li>
<li class="L3350" rel="L3350">received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister&#39;s,</li>
<li class="L3351" rel="L3351">Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has</li>
<li class="L3352" rel="L3352">been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy&#39;s regard.”</li>
<li class="L3353" rel="L3353"></li>
<li class="L3354" rel="L3354">“Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?”</li>
<li class="L3355" rel="L3355"></li>
<li class="L3356" rel="L3356">“No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”</li>
<li class="L3357" rel="L3357"></li>
<li class="L3358" rel="L3358">“This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am</li>
<li class="L3359" rel="L3359">satisfied. But what does he say of the living?”</li>
<li class="L3360" rel="L3360"></li>
<li class="L3361" rel="L3361">“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard</li>
<li class="L3362" rel="L3362">them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to</li>
<li class="L3363" rel="L3363">him _conditionally_ only.”</li>
<li class="L3364" rel="L3364"></li>
<li class="L3365" rel="L3365">“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley&#39;s sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly;</li>
<li class="L3366" rel="L3366">“but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.</li>
<li class="L3367" rel="L3367">Bingley&#39;s defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but</li>
<li class="L3368" rel="L3368">since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt</li>
<li class="L3369" rel="L3369">the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of</li>
<li class="L3370" rel="L3370">both gentlemen as I did before.”</li>
<li class="L3371" rel="L3371"></li>
<li class="L3372" rel="L3372">She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on</li>
<li class="L3373" rel="L3373">which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with</li>
<li class="L3374" rel="L3374">delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.</li>
<li class="L3375" rel="L3375">Bingley&#39;s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence</li>
<li class="L3376" rel="L3376">in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew</li>
<li class="L3377" rel="L3377">to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last</li>
<li class="L3378" rel="L3378">partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,</li>
<li class="L3379" rel="L3379">and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as</li>
<li class="L3380" rel="L3380">to make a most important discovery.</li>
<li class="L3381" rel="L3381"></li>
<li class="L3382" rel="L3382">“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now</li>
<li class="L3383" rel="L3383">in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the</li>
<li class="L3384" rel="L3384">gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of</li>
<li class="L3385" rel="L3385">the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady</li>
<li class="L3386" rel="L3386">Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have</li>
<li class="L3387" rel="L3387">thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de</li>
<li class="L3388" rel="L3388">Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made</li>
<li class="L3389" rel="L3389">in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to</li>
<li class="L3390" rel="L3390">do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total</li>
<li class="L3391" rel="L3391">ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”</li>
<li class="L3392" rel="L3392"></li>
<li class="L3393" rel="L3393">“You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!”</li>
<li class="L3394" rel="L3394"></li>
<li class="L3395" rel="L3395">“Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.</li>
<li class="L3396" rel="L3396">I believe him to be Lady Catherine&#39;s _nephew_. It will be in my power to</li>
<li class="L3397" rel="L3397">assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se&#39;nnight.”</li>
<li class="L3398" rel="L3398"></li>
<li class="L3399" rel="L3399">Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him</li>
<li class="L3400" rel="L3400">that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction</li>
<li class="L3401" rel="L3401">as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that</li>
<li class="L3402" rel="L3402">it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either</li>
<li class="L3403" rel="L3403">side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in</li>
<li class="L3404" rel="L3404">consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her</li>
<li class="L3405" rel="L3405">with the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she</li>
<li class="L3406" rel="L3406">ceased speaking, replied thus:</li>
<li class="L3407" rel="L3407"></li>
<li class="L3408" rel="L3408">“My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in</li>
<li class="L3409" rel="L3409">your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your</li>
<li class="L3410" rel="L3410">understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide</li>
<li class="L3411" rel="L3411">difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity,</li>
<li class="L3412" rel="L3412">and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that</li>
<li class="L3413" rel="L3413">I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with</li>
<li class="L3414" rel="L3414">the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of</li>
<li class="L3415" rel="L3415">behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to</li>
<li class="L3416" rel="L3416">follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to</li>
<li class="L3417" rel="L3417">perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to</li>
<li class="L3418" rel="L3418">profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant</li>
<li class="L3419" rel="L3419">guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by</li>
<li class="L3420" rel="L3420">education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young</li>
<li class="L3421" rel="L3421">lady like yourself.” And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.</li>
<li class="L3422" rel="L3422">Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose</li>
<li class="L3423" rel="L3423">astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced</li>
<li class="L3424" rel="L3424">his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of</li>
<li class="L3425" rel="L3425">it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the</li>
<li class="L3426" rel="L3426">words “apology,” “Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed</li>
<li class="L3427" rel="L3427">her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him</li>
<li class="L3428" rel="L3428">with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time</li>
<li class="L3429" rel="L3429">to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however,</li>
<li class="L3430" rel="L3430">was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy&#39;s contempt seemed</li>
<li class="L3431" rel="L3431">abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the</li>
<li class="L3432" rel="L3432">end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.</li>
<li class="L3433" rel="L3433">Collins then returned to Elizabeth.</li>
<li class="L3434" rel="L3434"></li>
<li class="L3435" rel="L3435">“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my</li>
<li class="L3436" rel="L3436">reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered</li>
<li class="L3437" rel="L3437">me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying</li>
<li class="L3438" rel="L3438">that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine&#39;s discernment as to be</li>
<li class="L3439" rel="L3439">certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very</li>
<li class="L3440" rel="L3440">handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”</li>
<li class="L3441" rel="L3441"></li>
<li class="L3442" rel="L3442">As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned</li>
<li class="L3443" rel="L3443">her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the</li>
<li class="L3444" rel="L3444">train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,</li>
<li class="L3445" rel="L3445">made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in</li>
<li class="L3446" rel="L3446">that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection</li>
<li class="L3447" rel="L3447">could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of</li>
<li class="L3448" rel="L3448">endeavouring even to like Bingley&#39;s two sisters. Her mother&#39;s thoughts</li>
<li class="L3449" rel="L3449">she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to</li>
<li class="L3450" rel="L3450">venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to</li>
<li class="L3451" rel="L3451">supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which</li>
<li class="L3452" rel="L3452">placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find</li>
<li class="L3453" rel="L3453">that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,</li>
<li class="L3454" rel="L3454">openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon</li>
<li class="L3455" rel="L3455">be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet</li>
<li class="L3456" rel="L3456">seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the</li>
<li class="L3457" rel="L3457">match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but</li>
<li class="L3458" rel="L3458">three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and</li>
<li class="L3459" rel="L3459">then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of</li>
<li class="L3460" rel="L3460">Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as</li>
<li class="L3461" rel="L3461">she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger</li>
<li class="L3462" rel="L3462">daughters, as Jane&#39;s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of</li>
<li class="L3463" rel="L3463">other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be</li>
<li class="L3464" rel="L3464">able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that</li>
<li class="L3465" rel="L3465">she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was</li>
<li class="L3466" rel="L3466">necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on</li>
<li class="L3467" rel="L3467">such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.</li>
<li class="L3468" rel="L3468">Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She</li>
<li class="L3469" rel="L3469">concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally</li>
<li class="L3470" rel="L3470">fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no</li>
<li class="L3471" rel="L3471">chance of it.</li>
<li class="L3472" rel="L3472"></li>
<li class="L3473" rel="L3473">In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother&#39;s</li>
<li class="L3474" rel="L3474">words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible</li>
<li class="L3475" rel="L3475">whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the</li>
<li class="L3476" rel="L3476">chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her</li>
<li class="L3477" rel="L3477">mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.</li>
<li class="L3478" rel="L3478"></li>
<li class="L3479" rel="L3479">“What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am</li>
<li class="L3480" rel="L3480">sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say</li>
<li class="L3481" rel="L3481">nothing _he_ may not like to hear.”</li>
<li class="L3482" rel="L3482"></li>
<li class="L3483" rel="L3483">“For heaven&#39;s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you</li>
<li class="L3484" rel="L3484">to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by</li>
<li class="L3485" rel="L3485">so doing!”</li>
<li class="L3486" rel="L3486"></li>
<li class="L3487" rel="L3487">Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would</li>
<li class="L3488" rel="L3488">talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and</li>
<li class="L3489" rel="L3489">blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently</li>
<li class="L3490" rel="L3490">glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what</li>
<li class="L3491" rel="L3491">she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was</li>
<li class="L3492" rel="L3492">convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression</li>
<li class="L3493" rel="L3493">of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and</li>
<li class="L3494" rel="L3494">steady gravity.</li>
<li class="L3495" rel="L3495"></li>
<li class="L3496" rel="L3496">At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who</li>
<li class="L3497" rel="L3497">had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no</li>
<li class="L3498" rel="L3498">likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and</li>
<li class="L3499" rel="L3499">chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of</li>
<li class="L3500" rel="L3500">tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and</li>
<li class="L3501" rel="L3501">she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,</li>
<li class="L3502" rel="L3502">preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent</li>
<li class="L3503" rel="L3503">entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,</li>
<li class="L3504" rel="L3504">but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of</li>
<li class="L3505" rel="L3505">exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth&#39;s</li>
<li class="L3506" rel="L3506">eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her</li>
<li class="L3507" rel="L3507">progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very</li>
<li class="L3508" rel="L3508">ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks</li>
<li class="L3509" rel="L3509">of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to</li>
<li class="L3510" rel="L3510">favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.</li>
<li class="L3511" rel="L3511">Mary&#39;s powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was</li>
<li class="L3512" rel="L3512">weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at</li>
<li class="L3513" rel="L3513">Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to</li>
<li class="L3514" rel="L3514">Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs</li>
<li class="L3515" rel="L3515">of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,</li>
<li class="L3516" rel="L3516">imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his</li>
<li class="L3517" rel="L3517">interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,</li>
<li class="L3518" rel="L3518">and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, “That will do</li>
<li class="L3519" rel="L3519">extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other</li>
<li class="L3520" rel="L3520">young ladies have time to exhibit.”</li>
<li class="L3521" rel="L3521"></li>
<li class="L3522" rel="L3522">Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and</li>
<li class="L3523" rel="L3523">Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father&#39;s speech, was afraid</li>
<li class="L3524" rel="L3524">her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.</li>
<li class="L3525" rel="L3525"></li>
<li class="L3526" rel="L3526">“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I</li>
<li class="L3527" rel="L3527">should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an</li>
<li class="L3528" rel="L3528">air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly</li>
<li class="L3529" rel="L3529">compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,</li>
<li class="L3530" rel="L3530">to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time</li>
<li class="L3531" rel="L3531">to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The</li>
<li class="L3532" rel="L3532">rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make</li>
<li class="L3533" rel="L3533">such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not</li>
<li class="L3534" rel="L3534">offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time</li>
<li class="L3535" rel="L3535">that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care</li>
<li class="L3536" rel="L3536">and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making</li>
<li class="L3537" rel="L3537">as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance</li>
<li class="L3538" rel="L3538">that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody,</li>
<li class="L3539" rel="L3539">especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit</li>
<li class="L3540" rel="L3540">him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an</li>
<li class="L3541" rel="L3541">occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the</li>
<li class="L3542" rel="L3542">family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had</li>
<li class="L3543" rel="L3543">been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared--many</li>
<li class="L3544" rel="L3544">smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his</li>
<li class="L3545" rel="L3545">wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly,</li>
<li class="L3546" rel="L3546">and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably</li>
<li class="L3547" rel="L3547">clever, good kind of young man.</li>
<li class="L3548" rel="L3548"></li>
<li class="L3549" rel="L3549">To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to</li>
<li class="L3550" rel="L3550">expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would</li>
<li class="L3551" rel="L3551">have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or</li>
<li class="L3552" rel="L3552">finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister</li>
<li class="L3553" rel="L3553">that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his</li>
<li class="L3554" rel="L3554">feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he</li>
<li class="L3555" rel="L3555">must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should</li>
<li class="L3556" rel="L3556">have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough,</li>
<li class="L3557" rel="L3557">and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the</li>
<li class="L3558" rel="L3558">gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.</li>
<li class="L3559" rel="L3559"></li>
<li class="L3560" rel="L3560">The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by</li>
<li class="L3561" rel="L3561">Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though</li>
<li class="L3562" rel="L3562">he could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her</li>
<li class="L3563" rel="L3563">power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with</li>
<li class="L3564" rel="L3564">somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.</li>
<li class="L3565" rel="L3565">He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;</li>
<li class="L3566" rel="L3566">that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to</li>
<li class="L3567" rel="L3567">her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her</li>
<li class="L3568" rel="L3568">the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed</li>
<li class="L3569" rel="L3569">her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and</li>
<li class="L3570" rel="L3570">good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins&#39;s conversation to herself.</li>
<li class="L3571" rel="L3571"></li>
<li class="L3572" rel="L3572">She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy&#39;s further notice;</li>
<li class="L3573" rel="L3573">though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite</li>
<li class="L3574" rel="L3574">disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the</li>
<li class="L3575" rel="L3575">probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in</li>
<li class="L3576" rel="L3576">it.</li>
<li class="L3577" rel="L3577"></li>
<li class="L3578" rel="L3578">The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by</li>
<li class="L3579" rel="L3579">a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of</li>
<li class="L3580" rel="L3580">an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how</li>
<li class="L3581" rel="L3581">heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her</li>
<li class="L3582" rel="L3582">sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and</li>
<li class="L3583" rel="L3583">were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed</li>
<li class="L3584" rel="L3584">every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a</li>
<li class="L3585" rel="L3585">languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the</li>
<li class="L3586" rel="L3586">long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his</li>
<li class="L3587" rel="L3587">sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and</li>
<li class="L3588" rel="L3588">politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said</li>
<li class="L3589" rel="L3589">nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.</li>
<li class="L3590" rel="L3590">Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the</li>
<li class="L3591" rel="L3591">rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a</li>
<li class="L3592" rel="L3592">silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too</li>
<li class="L3593" rel="L3593">much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord,</li>
<li class="L3594" rel="L3594">how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.</li>
<li class="L3595" rel="L3595"></li>
<li class="L3596" rel="L3596">When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly</li>
<li class="L3597" rel="L3597">civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and</li>
<li class="L3598" rel="L3598">addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he</li>
<li class="L3599" rel="L3599">would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without</li>
<li class="L3600" rel="L3600">the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure,</li>
<li class="L3601" rel="L3601">and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on</li>
<li class="L3602" rel="L3602">her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next</li>
<li class="L3603" rel="L3603">day for a short time.</li>
<li class="L3604" rel="L3604"></li>
<li class="L3605" rel="L3605">Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the</li>
<li class="L3606" rel="L3606">delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of</li>
<li class="L3607" rel="L3607">settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly</li>
<li class="L3608" rel="L3608">see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four</li>
<li class="L3609" rel="L3609">months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought</li>
<li class="L3610" rel="L3610">with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.</li>
<li class="L3611" rel="L3611">Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the</li>
<li class="L3612" rel="L3612">man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each</li>
<li class="L3613" rel="L3613">was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.</li>
<li class="L3614" rel="L3614"></li>
<li class="L3615" rel="L3615"></li>
<li class="L3616" rel="L3616"></li>
<li class="L3617" rel="L3617">Chapter 19</li>
<li class="L3618" rel="L3618"></li>
<li class="L3619" rel="L3619"></li>
<li class="L3620" rel="L3620">The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his</li>
<li class="L3621" rel="L3621">declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as</li>
<li class="L3622" rel="L3622">his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having</li>
<li class="L3623" rel="L3623">no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at</li>
<li class="L3624" rel="L3624">the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the</li>
<li class="L3625" rel="L3625">observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On</li>
<li class="L3626" rel="L3626">finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together,</li>
<li class="L3627" rel="L3627">soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:</li>
<li class="L3628" rel="L3628"></li>
<li class="L3629" rel="L3629">“May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,</li>
<li class="L3630" rel="L3630">when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the</li>
<li class="L3631" rel="L3631">course of this morning?”</li>
<li class="L3632" rel="L3632"></li>
<li class="L3633" rel="L3633">Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.</li>
<li class="L3634" rel="L3634">Bennet answered instantly, “Oh dear!--yes--certainly. I am sure Lizzy</li>
<li class="L3635" rel="L3635">will be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I</li>
<li class="L3636" rel="L3636">want you up stairs.” And, gathering her work together, she was hastening</li>
<li class="L3637" rel="L3637">away, when Elizabeth called out:</li>
<li class="L3638" rel="L3638"></li>
<li class="L3639" rel="L3639">“Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse</li>
<li class="L3640" rel="L3640">me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am</li>
<li class="L3641" rel="L3641">going away myself.”</li>
<li class="L3642" rel="L3642"></li>
<li class="L3643" rel="L3643">“No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.” And upon</li>
<li class="L3644" rel="L3644">Elizabeth&#39;s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to</li>
<li class="L3645" rel="L3645">escape, she added: “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr.</li>
<li class="L3646" rel="L3646">Collins.”</li>
<li class="L3647" rel="L3647"></li>
<li class="L3648" rel="L3648">Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment&#39;s</li>
<li class="L3649" rel="L3649">consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it</li>
<li class="L3650" rel="L3650">over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to</li>
<li class="L3651" rel="L3651">conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between</li>
<li class="L3652" rel="L3652">distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as</li>
<li class="L3653" rel="L3653">they were gone, Mr. Collins began.</li>
<li class="L3654" rel="L3654"></li>
<li class="L3655" rel="L3655">“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from</li>
<li class="L3656" rel="L3656">doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You</li>
<li class="L3657" rel="L3657">would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little</li>
<li class="L3658" rel="L3658">unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected</li>
<li class="L3659" rel="L3659">mother&#39;s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the</li>
<li class="L3660" rel="L3660">purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to</li>
<li class="L3661" rel="L3661">dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as</li>
<li class="L3662" rel="L3662">soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of</li>
<li class="L3663" rel="L3663">my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this</li>
<li class="L3664" rel="L3664">subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for</li>
<li class="L3665" rel="L3665">marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design</li>
<li class="L3666" rel="L3666">of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”</li>
<li class="L3667" rel="L3667"></li>
<li class="L3668" rel="L3668">The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away</li>
<li class="L3669" rel="L3669">with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could</li>
<li class="L3670" rel="L3670">not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further,</li>
<li class="L3671" rel="L3671">and he continued:</li>
<li class="L3672" rel="L3672"></li>
<li class="L3673" rel="L3673">“My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for</li>
<li class="L3674" rel="L3674">every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example</li>
<li class="L3675" rel="L3675">of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will</li>
<li class="L3676" rel="L3676">add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought</li>
<li class="L3677" rel="L3677">to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and</li>
<li class="L3678" rel="L3678">recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling</li>
<li class="L3679" rel="L3679">patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked</li>
<li class="L3680" rel="L3680">too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I</li>
<li class="L3681" rel="L3681">left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was</li>
<li class="L3682" rel="L3682">arranging Miss de Bourgh&#39;s footstool, that she said, &#39;Mr. Collins, you</li>
<li class="L3683" rel="L3683">must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose</li>
<li class="L3684" rel="L3684">a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,</li>
<li class="L3685" rel="L3685">useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small</li>
<li class="L3686" rel="L3686">income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as</li>
<li class="L3687" rel="L3687">you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.&#39; Allow me, by the</li>
<li class="L3688" rel="L3688">way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice</li>
<li class="L3689" rel="L3689">and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the</li>
<li class="L3690" rel="L3690">advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond</li>
<li class="L3691" rel="L3691">anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be</li>
<li class="L3692" rel="L3692">acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and</li>
<li class="L3693" rel="L3693">respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general</li>
<li class="L3694" rel="L3694">intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views</li>
<li class="L3695" rel="L3695">were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I</li>
<li class="L3696" rel="L3696">can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that</li>
<li class="L3697" rel="L3697">being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured</li>
<li class="L3698" rel="L3698">father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy</li>
<li class="L3699" rel="L3699">myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that</li>
<li class="L3700" rel="L3700">the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy</li>
<li class="L3701" rel="L3701">event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not</li>
<li class="L3702" rel="L3702">be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and</li>
<li class="L3703" rel="L3703">I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing</li>
<li class="L3704" rel="L3704">remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the</li>
<li class="L3705" rel="L3705">violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and</li>
<li class="L3706" rel="L3706">shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well</li>
<li class="L3707" rel="L3707">aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds</li>
<li class="L3708" rel="L3708">in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother&#39;s</li>
<li class="L3709" rel="L3709">decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,</li>
<li class="L3710" rel="L3710">therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that</li>
<li class="L3711" rel="L3711">no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”</li>
<li class="L3712" rel="L3712"></li>
<li class="L3713" rel="L3713">It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.</li>
<li class="L3714" rel="L3714"></li>
<li class="L3715" rel="L3715">“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget that I have made no</li>
<li class="L3716" rel="L3716">answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for</li>
<li class="L3717" rel="L3717">the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of</li>
<li class="L3718" rel="L3718">your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to</li>
<li class="L3719" rel="L3719">decline them.”</li>
<li class="L3720" rel="L3720"></li>
<li class="L3721" rel="L3721">“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the</li>
<li class="L3722" rel="L3722">hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the</li>
<li class="L3723" rel="L3723">man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their</li>
<li class="L3724" rel="L3724">favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a</li>
<li class="L3725" rel="L3725">third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just</li>
<li class="L3726" rel="L3726">said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”</li>
<li class="L3727" rel="L3727"></li>
<li class="L3728" rel="L3728">“Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is a rather</li>
<li class="L3729" rel="L3729">extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not</li>
<li class="L3730" rel="L3730">one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so</li>
<li class="L3731" rel="L3731">daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second</li>
<li class="L3732" rel="L3732">time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_</li>
<li class="L3733" rel="L3733">happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who</li>
<li class="L3734" rel="L3734">could make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I</li>
<li class="L3735" rel="L3735">am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the</li>
<li class="L3736" rel="L3736">situation.”</li>
<li class="L3737" rel="L3737"></li>
<li class="L3738" rel="L3738">“Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins</li>
<li class="L3739" rel="L3739">very gravely--“but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all</li>
<li class="L3740" rel="L3740">disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of</li>
<li class="L3741" rel="L3741">seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your</li>
<li class="L3742" rel="L3742">modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification.”</li>
<li class="L3743" rel="L3743"></li>
<li class="L3744" rel="L3744">“Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You</li>
<li class="L3745" rel="L3745">must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment</li>
<li class="L3746" rel="L3746">of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by</li>
<li class="L3747" rel="L3747">refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.</li>
<li class="L3748" rel="L3748">In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your</li>
<li class="L3749" rel="L3749">feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn</li>
<li class="L3750" rel="L3750">estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may</li>
<li class="L3751" rel="L3751">be considered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she</li>
<li class="L3752" rel="L3752">thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus</li>
<li class="L3753" rel="L3753">addressed her:</li>
<li class="L3754" rel="L3754"></li>
<li class="L3755" rel="L3755">“When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I</li>
<li class="L3756" rel="L3756">shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given</li>
<li class="L3757" rel="L3757">me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I</li>
<li class="L3758" rel="L3758">know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on</li>
<li class="L3759" rel="L3759">the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to</li>
<li class="L3760" rel="L3760">encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the</li>
<li class="L3761" rel="L3761">female character.”</li>
<li class="L3762" rel="L3762"></li>
<li class="L3763" rel="L3763">“Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth with some warmth, “you puzzle me</li>
<li class="L3764" rel="L3764">exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form</li>
<li class="L3765" rel="L3765">of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as</li>
<li class="L3766" rel="L3766">to convince you of its being one.”</li>
<li class="L3767" rel="L3767"></li>
<li class="L3768" rel="L3768">“You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your</li>
<li class="L3769" rel="L3769">refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for</li>
<li class="L3770" rel="L3770">believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is</li>
<li class="L3771" rel="L3771">unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would</li>
<li class="L3772" rel="L3772">be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections</li>
<li class="L3773" rel="L3773">with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are</li>
<li class="L3774" rel="L3774">circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further</li>
<li class="L3775" rel="L3775">consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no</li>
<li class="L3776" rel="L3776">means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your</li>
<li class="L3777" rel="L3777">portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo</li>
<li class="L3778" rel="L3778">the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must</li>
<li class="L3779" rel="L3779">therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me,</li>
<li class="L3780" rel="L3780">I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by</li>
<li class="L3781" rel="L3781">suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”</li>
<li class="L3782" rel="L3782"></li>
<li class="L3783" rel="L3783">“I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind</li>
<li class="L3784" rel="L3784">of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would</li>
<li class="L3785" rel="L3785">rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you</li>
<li class="L3786" rel="L3786">again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but</li>
<li class="L3787" rel="L3787">to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect</li>
<li class="L3788" rel="L3788">forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant</li>
<li class="L3789" rel="L3789">female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking</li>
<li class="L3790" rel="L3790">the truth from her heart.”</li>
<li class="L3791" rel="L3791"></li>
<li class="L3792" rel="L3792">“You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward</li>
<li class="L3793" rel="L3793">gallantry; “and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express</li>
<li class="L3794" rel="L3794">authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of</li>
<li class="L3795" rel="L3795">being acceptable.”</li>
<li class="L3796" rel="L3796"></li>
<li class="L3797" rel="L3797">To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make</li>
<li class="L3798" rel="L3798">no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if</li>
<li class="L3799" rel="L3799">he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering</li>
<li class="L3800" rel="L3800">encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered</li>
<li class="L3801" rel="L3801">in such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could</li>
<li class="L3802" rel="L3802">not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.</li>
<li class="L3803" rel="L3803"></li>
<li class="L3804" rel="L3804"></li>
<li class="L3805" rel="L3805"></li>
<li class="L3806" rel="L3806">Chapter 20</li>
<li class="L3807" rel="L3807"></li>
<li class="L3808" rel="L3808"></li>
<li class="L3809" rel="L3809">Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his</li>
<li class="L3810" rel="L3810">successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule</li>
<li class="L3811" rel="L3811">to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open</li>
<li class="L3812" rel="L3812">the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she</li>
<li class="L3813" rel="L3813">entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in</li>
<li class="L3814" rel="L3814">warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins</li>
<li class="L3815" rel="L3815">received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then</li>
<li class="L3816" rel="L3816">proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result</li>
<li class="L3817" rel="L3817">of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the</li>
<li class="L3818" rel="L3818">refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow</li>
<li class="L3819" rel="L3819">from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.</li>
<li class="L3820" rel="L3820"></li>
<li class="L3821" rel="L3821">This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been</li>
<li class="L3822" rel="L3822">glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage</li>
<li class="L3823" rel="L3823">him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,</li>
<li class="L3824" rel="L3824">and could not help saying so.</li>
<li class="L3825" rel="L3825"></li>
<li class="L3826" rel="L3826">“But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be</li>
<li class="L3827" rel="L3827">brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very</li>
<li class="L3828" rel="L3828">headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will</li>
<li class="L3829" rel="L3829">_make_ her know it.”</li>
<li class="L3830" rel="L3830"></li>
<li class="L3831" rel="L3831">“Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but if</li>
<li class="L3832" rel="L3832">she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would</li>
<li class="L3833" rel="L3833">altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who</li>
<li class="L3834" rel="L3834">naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she</li>
<li class="L3835" rel="L3835">actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not</li>
<li class="L3836" rel="L3836">to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of</li>
<li class="L3837" rel="L3837">temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”</li>
<li class="L3838" rel="L3838"></li>
<li class="L3839" rel="L3839">“Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. “Lizzy is</li>
<li class="L3840" rel="L3840">only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as</li>
<li class="L3841" rel="L3841">good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and</li>
<li class="L3842" rel="L3842">we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”</li>
<li class="L3843" rel="L3843"></li>
<li class="L3844" rel="L3844">She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her</li>
<li class="L3845" rel="L3845">husband, called out as she entered the library, “Oh! Mr. Bennet, you</li>
<li class="L3846" rel="L3846">are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make</li>
<li class="L3847" rel="L3847">Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you</li>
<li class="L3848" rel="L3848">do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_.”</li>
<li class="L3849" rel="L3849"></li>
<li class="L3850" rel="L3850">Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them</li>
<li class="L3851" rel="L3851">on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by</li>
<li class="L3852" rel="L3852">her communication.</li>
<li class="L3853" rel="L3853"></li>
<li class="L3854" rel="L3854">“I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she had</li>
<li class="L3855" rel="L3855">finished her speech. “Of what are you talking?”</li>
<li class="L3856" rel="L3856"></li>
<li class="L3857" rel="L3857">“Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,</li>
<li class="L3858" rel="L3858">and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.”</li>
<li class="L3859" rel="L3859"></li>
<li class="L3860" rel="L3860">“And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.”</li>
<li class="L3861" rel="L3861"></li>
<li class="L3862" rel="L3862">“Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her</li>
<li class="L3863" rel="L3863">marrying him.”</li>
<li class="L3864" rel="L3864"></li>
<li class="L3865" rel="L3865">“Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.”</li>
<li class="L3866" rel="L3866"></li>
<li class="L3867" rel="L3867">Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the</li>
<li class="L3868" rel="L3868">library.</li>
<li class="L3869" rel="L3869"></li>
<li class="L3870" rel="L3870">“Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared. “I have sent for</li>
<li class="L3871" rel="L3871">you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made</li>
<li class="L3872" rel="L3872">you an offer of marriage. Is it true?” Elizabeth replied that it was.</li>
<li class="L3873" rel="L3873">“Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?”</li>
<li class="L3874" rel="L3874"></li>
<li class="L3875" rel="L3875">“I have, sir.”</li>
<li class="L3876" rel="L3876"></li>
<li class="L3877" rel="L3877">“Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your</li>
<li class="L3878" rel="L3878">accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”</li>
<li class="L3879" rel="L3879"></li>
<li class="L3880" rel="L3880">“Yes, or I will never see her again.”</li>
<li class="L3881" rel="L3881"></li>
<li class="L3882" rel="L3882">“An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must</li>
<li class="L3883" rel="L3883">be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you</li>
<li class="L3884" rel="L3884">again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again</li>
<li class="L3885" rel="L3885">if you _do_.”</li>
<li class="L3886" rel="L3886"></li>
<li class="L3887" rel="L3887">Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning,</li>
<li class="L3888" rel="L3888">but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the</li>
<li class="L3889" rel="L3889">affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.</li>
<li class="L3890" rel="L3890"></li>
<li class="L3891" rel="L3891">“What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to</li>
<li class="L3892" rel="L3892">_insist_ upon her marrying him.”</li>
<li class="L3893" rel="L3893"></li>
<li class="L3894" rel="L3894">“My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to request.</li>
<li class="L3895" rel="L3895">First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the</li>
<li class="L3896" rel="L3896">present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the</li>
<li class="L3897" rel="L3897">library to myself as soon as may be.”</li>
<li class="L3898" rel="L3898"></li>
<li class="L3899" rel="L3899">Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did</li>
<li class="L3900" rel="L3900">Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;</li>
<li class="L3901" rel="L3901">coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane</li>
<li class="L3902" rel="L3902">in her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined</li>
<li class="L3903" rel="L3903">interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and</li>
<li class="L3904" rel="L3904">sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner</li>
<li class="L3905" rel="L3905">varied, however, her determination never did.</li>
<li class="L3906" rel="L3906"></li>
<li class="L3907" rel="L3907">Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.</li>
<li class="L3908" rel="L3908">He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin</li>
<li class="L3909" rel="L3909">could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other</li>
<li class="L3910" rel="L3910">way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her</li>
<li class="L3911" rel="L3911">deserving her mother&#39;s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.</li>
<li class="L3912" rel="L3912"></li>
<li class="L3913" rel="L3913">While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend</li>
<li class="L3914" rel="L3914">the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to</li>
<li class="L3915" rel="L3915">her, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is such</li>
<li class="L3916" rel="L3916">fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has</li>
<li class="L3917" rel="L3917">made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.”</li>
<li class="L3918" rel="L3918"></li>
<li class="L3919" rel="L3919">Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,</li>
<li class="L3920" rel="L3920">who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the</li>
<li class="L3921" rel="L3921">breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on</li>
<li class="L3922" rel="L3922">the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating</li>
<li class="L3923" rel="L3923">her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her</li>
<li class="L3924" rel="L3924">family. “Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,” she added in a melancholy tone,</li>
<li class="L3925" rel="L3925">“for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used,</li>
<li class="L3926" rel="L3926">nobody feels for my poor nerves.”</li>
<li class="L3927" rel="L3927"></li>
<li class="L3928" rel="L3928">Charlotte&#39;s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.</li>
<li class="L3929" rel="L3929"></li>
<li class="L3930" rel="L3930">“Aye, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as unconcerned</li>
<li class="L3931" rel="L3931">as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided</li>
<li class="L3932" rel="L3932">she can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzy--if you take it</li>
<li class="L3933" rel="L3933">into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,</li>
<li class="L3934" rel="L3934">you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is</li>
<li class="L3935" rel="L3935">to maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep</li>
<li class="L3936" rel="L3936">you--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told</li>
<li class="L3937" rel="L3937">you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,</li>
<li class="L3938" rel="L3938">and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking</li>
<li class="L3939" rel="L3939">to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking</li>
<li class="L3940" rel="L3940">to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have</li>
<li class="L3941" rel="L3941">no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it</li>
<li class="L3942" rel="L3942">is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.”</li>
<li class="L3943" rel="L3943"></li>
<li class="L3944" rel="L3944">Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that</li>
<li class="L3945" rel="L3945">any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the</li>
<li class="L3946" rel="L3946">irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of</li>
<li class="L3947" rel="L3947">them, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room with</li>
<li class="L3948" rel="L3948">an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to</li>
<li class="L3949" rel="L3949">the girls, “Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold</li>
<li class="L3950" rel="L3950">your tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation</li>
<li class="L3951" rel="L3951">together.”</li>
<li class="L3952" rel="L3952"></li>
<li class="L3953" rel="L3953">Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but</li>
<li class="L3954" rel="L3954">Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,</li>
<li class="L3955" rel="L3955">detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after</li>
<li class="L3956" rel="L3956">herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little</li>
<li class="L3957" rel="L3957">curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending</li>
<li class="L3958" rel="L3958">not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected</li>
<li class="L3959" rel="L3959">conversation: “Oh! Mr. Collins!”</li>
<li class="L3960" rel="L3960"></li>
<li class="L3961" rel="L3961">“My dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this point.</li>
<li class="L3962" rel="L3962">Far be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice that marked his</li>
<li class="L3963" rel="L3963">displeasure, “to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation</li>
<li class="L3964" rel="L3964">to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a</li>
<li class="L3965" rel="L3965">young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment;</li>
<li class="L3966" rel="L3966">and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt</li>
<li class="L3967" rel="L3967">of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand;</li>
<li class="L3968" rel="L3968">for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as</li>
<li class="L3969" rel="L3969">when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our</li>
<li class="L3970" rel="L3970">estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect</li>
<li class="L3971" rel="L3971">to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to</li>
<li class="L3972" rel="L3972">your daughter&#39;s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the</li>
<li class="L3973" rel="L3973">compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my</li>
<li class="L3974" rel="L3974">behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my</li>
<li class="L3975" rel="L3975">dismission from your daughter&#39;s lips instead of your own. But we are all</li>
<li class="L3976" rel="L3976">liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.</li>
<li class="L3977" rel="L3977">My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due</li>
<li class="L3978" rel="L3978">consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_</li>
<li class="L3979" rel="L3979">has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.”</li>
<li class="L3980" rel="L3980"></li>
<li class="L3981" rel="L3981"></li>
<li class="L3982" rel="L3982"></li>
<li class="L3983" rel="L3983">Chapter 21</li>
<li class="L3984" rel="L3984"></li>
<li class="L3985" rel="L3985"></li>
<li class="L3986" rel="L3986">The discussion of Mr. Collins&#39;s offer was now nearly at an end, and</li>
<li class="L3987" rel="L3987">Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily</li>
<li class="L3988" rel="L3988">attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her</li>
<li class="L3989" rel="L3989">mother. As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly</li>
<li class="L3990" rel="L3990">expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her,</li>
<li class="L3991" rel="L3991">but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke</li>
<li class="L3992" rel="L3992">to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of</li>
<li class="L3993" rel="L3993">himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose</li>
<li class="L3994" rel="L3994">civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and</li>
<li class="L3995" rel="L3995">especially to her friend.</li>
<li class="L3996" rel="L3996"></li>
<li class="L3997" rel="L3997">The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet&#39;s ill-humour or ill</li>
<li class="L3998" rel="L3998">health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth</li>
<li class="L3999" rel="L3999">had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did</li>
<li class="L4000" rel="L4000">not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on</li>
<li class="L4001" rel="L4001">Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.</li>
<li class="L4002" rel="L4002"></li>
<li class="L4003" rel="L4003">After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham</li>
<li class="L4004" rel="L4004">were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.</li>
<li class="L4005" rel="L4005">He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their</li>
<li class="L4006" rel="L4006">aunt&#39;s where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was</li>
<li class="L4007" rel="L4007">well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged</li>
<li class="L4008" rel="L4008">that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.</li>
<li class="L4009" rel="L4009"></li>
<li class="L4010" rel="L4010">“I found,” said he, “as the time drew near that I had better not meet</li>
<li class="L4011" rel="L4011">Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so</li>
<li class="L4012" rel="L4012">many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes</li>
<li class="L4013" rel="L4013">might arise unpleasant to more than myself.”</li>
<li class="L4014" rel="L4014"></li>
<li class="L4015" rel="L4015">She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full</li>
<li class="L4016" rel="L4016">discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly</li>
<li class="L4017" rel="L4017">bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with</li>
<li class="L4018" rel="L4018">them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to</li>
<li class="L4019" rel="L4019">her. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the</li>
<li class="L4020" rel="L4020">compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an</li>
<li class="L4021" rel="L4021">occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.</li>
<li class="L4022" rel="L4022"></li>
<li class="L4023" rel="L4023">Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came</li>
<li class="L4024" rel="L4024">from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little,</li>
<li class="L4025" rel="L4025">hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady&#39;s fair, flowing hand; and</li>
<li class="L4026" rel="L4026">Elizabeth saw her sister&#39;s countenance change as she read it, and saw</li>
<li class="L4027" rel="L4027">her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected</li>
<li class="L4028" rel="L4028">herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual</li>
<li class="L4029" rel="L4029">cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety</li>
<li class="L4030" rel="L4030">on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no</li>
<li class="L4031" rel="L4031">sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane</li>
<li class="L4032" rel="L4032">invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room,</li>
<li class="L4033" rel="L4033">Jane, taking out the letter, said:</li>
<li class="L4034" rel="L4034"></li>
<li class="L4035" rel="L4035">“This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good</li>
<li class="L4036" rel="L4036">deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on</li>
<li class="L4037" rel="L4037">their way to town--and without any intention of coming back again. You</li>
<li class="L4038" rel="L4038">shall hear what she says.”</li>
<li class="L4039" rel="L4039"></li>
<li class="L4040" rel="L4040">She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information</li>
<li class="L4041" rel="L4041">of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,</li>
<li class="L4042" rel="L4042">and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a</li>
<li class="L4043" rel="L4043">house. The next was in these words: “I do not pretend to regret anything</li>
<li class="L4044" rel="L4044">I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend;</li>
<li class="L4045" rel="L4045">but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that</li>
<li class="L4046" rel="L4046">delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may</li>
<li class="L4047" rel="L4047">lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved</li>
<li class="L4048" rel="L4048">correspondence. I depend on you for that.” To these highflown</li>
<li class="L4049" rel="L4049">expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust;</li>
<li class="L4050" rel="L4050">and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw</li>
<li class="L4051" rel="L4051">nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their</li>
<li class="L4052" rel="L4052">absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley&#39;s being there; and as</li>
<li class="L4053" rel="L4053">to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to</li>
<li class="L4054" rel="L4054">regard it, in the enjoyment of his.</li>
<li class="L4055" rel="L4055"></li>
<li class="L4056" rel="L4056">“It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be</li>
<li class="L4057" rel="L4057">able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not</li>
<li class="L4058" rel="L4058">hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks</li>
<li class="L4059" rel="L4059">forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful</li>
<li class="L4060" rel="L4060">intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater</li>
<li class="L4061" rel="L4061">satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by</li>
<li class="L4062" rel="L4062">them.”</li>
<li class="L4063" rel="L4063"></li>
<li class="L4064" rel="L4064">“Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into</li>
<li class="L4065" rel="L4065">Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:”</li>
<li class="L4066" rel="L4066"></li>
<li class="L4067" rel="L4067">“When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which</li>
<li class="L4068" rel="L4068">took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we</li>
<li class="L4069" rel="L4069">are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when</li>
<li class="L4070" rel="L4070">Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have</li>
<li class="L4071" rel="L4071">determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend</li>
<li class="L4072" rel="L4072">his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are</li>
<li class="L4073" rel="L4073">already there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my</li>
<li class="L4074" rel="L4074">dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd--but of</li>
<li class="L4075" rel="L4075">that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may</li>
<li class="L4076" rel="L4076">abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your</li>
<li class="L4077" rel="L4077">beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the</li>
<li class="L4078" rel="L4078">three of whom we shall deprive you.”</li>
<li class="L4079" rel="L4079"></li>
<li class="L4080" rel="L4080">“It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more this</li>
<li class="L4081" rel="L4081">winter.”</li>
<li class="L4082" rel="L4082"></li>
<li class="L4083" rel="L4083">“It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he _should_.”</li>
<li class="L4084" rel="L4084"></li>
<li class="L4085" rel="L4085">“Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own</li>
<li class="L4086" rel="L4086">master. But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which</li>
<li class="L4087" rel="L4087">particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.”</li>
<li class="L4088" rel="L4088"></li>
<li class="L4089" rel="L4089">“Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth,</li>
<li class="L4090" rel="L4090">_we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think</li>
<li class="L4091" rel="L4091">Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments;</li>
<li class="L4092" rel="L4092">and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into</li>
<li class="L4093" rel="L4093">something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of</li>
<li class="L4094" rel="L4094">her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before</li>
<li class="L4095" rel="L4095">mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the</li>
<li class="L4096" rel="L4096">country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them</li>
<li class="L4097" rel="L4097">unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have</li>
<li class="L4098" rel="L4098">frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing;</li>
<li class="L4099" rel="L4099">her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister&#39;s</li>
<li class="L4100" rel="L4100">partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most</li>
<li class="L4101" rel="L4101">capable of engaging any woman&#39;s heart. With all these circumstances to</li>
<li class="L4102" rel="L4102">favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest</li>
<li class="L4103" rel="L4103">Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness</li>
<li class="L4104" rel="L4104">of so many?”</li>
<li class="L4105" rel="L4105"></li>
<li class="L4106" rel="L4106">“What do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said Jane as she</li>
<li class="L4107" rel="L4107">finished it. “Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that</li>
<li class="L4108" rel="L4108">Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is</li>
<li class="L4109" rel="L4109">perfectly convinced of her brother&#39;s indifference; and that if she</li>
<li class="L4110" rel="L4110">suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to</li>
<li class="L4111" rel="L4111">put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?”</li>
<li class="L4112" rel="L4112"></li>
<li class="L4113" rel="L4113">“Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?”</li>
<li class="L4114" rel="L4114"></li>
<li class="L4115" rel="L4115">“Most willingly.”</li>
<li class="L4116" rel="L4116"></li>
<li class="L4117" rel="L4117">“You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is</li>
<li class="L4118" rel="L4118">in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him</li>
<li class="L4119" rel="L4119">to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he</li>
<li class="L4120" rel="L4120">does not care about you.”</li>
<li class="L4121" rel="L4121"></li>
<li class="L4122" rel="L4122">Jane shook her head.</li>
<li class="L4123" rel="L4123"></li>
<li class="L4124" rel="L4124">“Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you</li>
<li class="L4125" rel="L4125">together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She</li>
<li class="L4126" rel="L4126">is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.</li>
<li class="L4127" rel="L4127">Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the</li>
<li class="L4128" rel="L4128">case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she</li>
<li class="L4129" rel="L4129">is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion</li>
<li class="L4130" rel="L4130">that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble</li>
<li class="L4131" rel="L4131">in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and</li>
<li class="L4132" rel="L4132">I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,</li>
<li class="L4133" rel="L4133">my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley</li>
<li class="L4134" rel="L4134">tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest</li>
<li class="L4135" rel="L4135">degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on</li>
<li class="L4136" rel="L4136">Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead</li>
<li class="L4137" rel="L4137">of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.”</li>
<li class="L4138" rel="L4138"></li>
<li class="L4139" rel="L4139">“If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your</li>
<li class="L4140" rel="L4140">representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the</li>
<li class="L4141" rel="L4141">foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving</li>
<li class="L4142" rel="L4142">anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving</li>
<li class="L4143" rel="L4143">herself.”</li>
<li class="L4144" rel="L4144"></li>
<li class="L4145" rel="L4145">“That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you</li>
<li class="L4146" rel="L4146">will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means.</li>
<li class="L4147" rel="L4147">You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”</li>
<li class="L4148" rel="L4148"></li>
<li class="L4149" rel="L4149">“But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in</li>
<li class="L4150" rel="L4150">accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry</li>
<li class="L4151" rel="L4151">elsewhere?”</li>
<li class="L4152" rel="L4152"></li>
<li class="L4153" rel="L4153">“You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon mature</li>
<li class="L4154" rel="L4154">deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is</li>
<li class="L4155" rel="L4155">more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by</li>
<li class="L4156" rel="L4156">all means to refuse him.”</li>
<li class="L4157" rel="L4157"></li>
<li class="L4158" rel="L4158">“How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling. “You must know that</li>
<li class="L4159" rel="L4159">though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could</li>
<li class="L4160" rel="L4160">not hesitate.”</li>
<li class="L4161" rel="L4161"></li>
<li class="L4162" rel="L4162">“I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider</li>
<li class="L4163" rel="L4163">your situation with much compassion.”</li>
<li class="L4164" rel="L4164"></li>
<li class="L4165" rel="L4165">“But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be</li>
<li class="L4166" rel="L4166">required. A thousand things may arise in six months!”</li>
<li class="L4167" rel="L4167"></li>
<li class="L4168" rel="L4168">The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost</li>
<li class="L4169" rel="L4169">contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline&#39;s</li>
<li class="L4170" rel="L4170">interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those</li>
<li class="L4171" rel="L4171">wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man</li>
<li class="L4172" rel="L4172">so totally independent of everyone.</li>
<li class="L4173" rel="L4173"></li>
<li class="L4174" rel="L4174">She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt</li>
<li class="L4175" rel="L4175">on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.</li>
<li class="L4176" rel="L4176">Jane&#39;s temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,</li>
<li class="L4177" rel="L4177">though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that</li>
<li class="L4178" rel="L4178">Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.</li>
<li class="L4179" rel="L4179"></li>
<li class="L4180" rel="L4180">They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the</li>
<li class="L4181" rel="L4181">family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman&#39;s conduct;</li>
<li class="L4182" rel="L4182">but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,</li>
<li class="L4183" rel="L4183">and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen</li>
<li class="L4184" rel="L4184">to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After</li>
<li class="L4185" rel="L4185">lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.</li>
<li class="L4186" rel="L4186">Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the</li>
<li class="L4187" rel="L4187">conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had</li>
<li class="L4188" rel="L4188">been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two</li>
<li class="L4189" rel="L4189">full courses.</li>
<li class="L4190" rel="L4190"></li>

<li class="L4195" rel="L4195"></li>
<li class="L4196" rel="L4196">The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the</li>
<li class="L4197" rel="L4197">chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.</li>
<li class="L4198" rel="L4198">Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “It keeps him in good</li>
<li class="L4199" rel="L4199">humour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can express.”</li>
<li class="L4200" rel="L4200"> Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and</li>
<li class="L4201" rel="L4201">that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was</li>
<li class="L4202" rel="L4202">very amiable, but Charlotte&#39;s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth</li>
<li class="L4203" rel="L4203">had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her</li>
<li class="L4204" rel="L4204">from any return of Mr. Collins&#39;s addresses, by engaging them towards</li>
<li class="L4205" rel="L4205">herself. Such was Miss Lucas&#39;s scheme; and appearances were so</li>
<li class="L4206" rel="L4206">favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost</li>
<li class="L4207" rel="L4207">secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very</li>
<li class="L4208" rel="L4208">soon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his</li>
<li class="L4209" rel="L4209">character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next</li>
<li class="L4210" rel="L4210">morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw</li>
<li class="L4211" rel="L4211">himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,</li>
<li class="L4212" rel="L4212">from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to</li>
<li class="L4213" rel="L4213">conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known</li>
<li class="L4214" rel="L4214">till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost</li>
<li class="L4215" rel="L4215">secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,</li>
<li class="L4216" rel="L4216">he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.</li>
<li class="L4217" rel="L4217">His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas</li>
<li class="L4218" rel="L4218">perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and</li>
<li class="L4219" rel="L4219">instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had</li>
<li class="L4220" rel="L4220">she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.</li>
<li class="L4221" rel="L4221"></li>
<li class="L4222" rel="L4222">In as short a time as Mr. Collins&#39;s long speeches would allow,</li>
<li class="L4223" rel="L4223">everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as</li>
<li class="L4224" rel="L4224">they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that</li>
<li class="L4225" rel="L4225">was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must</li>
<li class="L4226" rel="L4226">be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with</li>
<li class="L4227" rel="L4227">his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must</li>
<li class="L4228" rel="L4228">guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its</li>
<li class="L4229" rel="L4229">continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure</li>
<li class="L4230" rel="L4230">and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that</li>
<li class="L4231" rel="L4231">establishment were gained.</li>
<li class="L4232" rel="L4232"></li>
<li class="L4233" rel="L4233">Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;</li>
<li class="L4234" rel="L4234">and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins&#39;s present</li>
<li class="L4235" rel="L4235">circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom</li>
<li class="L4236" rel="L4236">they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were</li>
<li class="L4237" rel="L4237">exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more</li>
<li class="L4238" rel="L4238">interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer</li>
<li class="L4239" rel="L4239">Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided</li>
<li class="L4240" rel="L4240">opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the</li>
<li class="L4241" rel="L4241">Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife</li>
<li class="L4242" rel="L4242">should make their appearance at St. James&#39;s. The whole family, in short,</li>
<li class="L4243" rel="L4243">were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes</li>
<li class="L4244" rel="L4244">of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have</li>
<li class="L4245" rel="L4245">done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte&#39;s</li>
<li class="L4246" rel="L4246">dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had</li>
<li class="L4247" rel="L4247">gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were</li>
<li class="L4248" rel="L4248">in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible</li>
<li class="L4249" rel="L4249">nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must</li>
<li class="L4250" rel="L4250">be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly</li>
<li class="L4251" rel="L4251">either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was</li>
<li class="L4252" rel="L4252">the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune,</li>
<li class="L4253" rel="L4253">and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest</li>
<li class="L4254" rel="L4254">preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at</li>
<li class="L4255" rel="L4255">the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all</li>
<li class="L4256" rel="L4256">the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business</li>
<li class="L4257" rel="L4257">was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship</li>
<li class="L4258" rel="L4258">she valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder,</li>
<li class="L4259" rel="L4259">and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be</li>
<li class="L4260" rel="L4260">shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved</li>
<li class="L4261" rel="L4261">to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins,</li>
<li class="L4262" rel="L4262">when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had</li>
<li class="L4263" rel="L4263">passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very</li>
<li class="L4264" rel="L4264">dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the</li>
<li class="L4265" rel="L4265">curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct</li>
<li class="L4266" rel="L4266">questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was</li>
<li class="L4267" rel="L4267">at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to</li>
<li class="L4268" rel="L4268">publish his prosperous love.</li>
<li class="L4269" rel="L4269"></li>
<li class="L4270" rel="L4270">As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the</li>
<li class="L4271" rel="L4271">family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved</li>
<li class="L4272" rel="L4272">for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality,</li>
<li class="L4273" rel="L4273">said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever</li>
<li class="L4274" rel="L4274">his engagements might allow him to visit them.</li>
<li class="L4275" rel="L4275"></li>
<li class="L4276" rel="L4276">“My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly</li>
<li class="L4277" rel="L4277">gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and</li>
<li class="L4278" rel="L4278">you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as</li>
<li class="L4279" rel="L4279">possible.”</li>
<li class="L4280" rel="L4280"></li>
<li class="L4281" rel="L4281">They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for</li>
<li class="L4282" rel="L4282">so speedy a return, immediately said:</li>
<li class="L4283" rel="L4283"></li>
<li class="L4284" rel="L4284">“But is there not danger of Lady Catherine&#39;s disapprobation here, my</li>
<li class="L4285" rel="L4285">good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of</li>
<li class="L4286" rel="L4286">offending your patroness.”</li>
<li class="L4287" rel="L4287"></li>
<li class="L4288" rel="L4288">“My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you</li>
<li class="L4289" rel="L4289">for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so</li>
<li class="L4290" rel="L4290">material a step without her ladyship&#39;s concurrence.”</li>
<li class="L4291" rel="L4291"></li>
<li class="L4292" rel="L4292">“You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her</li>
<li class="L4293" rel="L4293">displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us</li>
<li class="L4294" rel="L4294">again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,</li>
<li class="L4295" rel="L4295">and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.”</li>
<li class="L4296" rel="L4296"></li>
<li class="L4297" rel="L4297">“Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such</li>
<li class="L4298" rel="L4298">affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive</li>
<li class="L4299" rel="L4299">from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your</li>
<li class="L4300" rel="L4300">regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though</li>
<li class="L4301" rel="L4301">my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now</li>
<li class="L4302" rel="L4302">take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my</li>
<li class="L4303" rel="L4303">cousin Elizabeth.”</li>
<li class="L4304" rel="L4304"></li>
<li class="L4305" rel="L4305">With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally</li>
<li class="L4306" rel="L4306">surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to</li>
<li class="L4307" rel="L4307">understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her</li>
<li class="L4308" rel="L4308">younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.</li>
<li class="L4309" rel="L4309">She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was</li>
<li class="L4310" rel="L4310">a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no</li>
<li class="L4311" rel="L4311">means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read</li>
<li class="L4312" rel="L4312">and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very</li>
<li class="L4313" rel="L4313">agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this</li>
<li class="L4314" rel="L4314">kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a</li>
<li class="L4315" rel="L4315">private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.</li>
<li class="L4316" rel="L4316"></li>
<li class="L4317" rel="L4317">The possibility of Mr. Collins&#39;s fancying himself in love with her</li>
<li class="L4318" rel="L4318">friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but</li>
<li class="L4319" rel="L4319">that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from</li>
<li class="L4320" rel="L4320">possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was</li>
<li class="L4321" rel="L4321">consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and</li>
<li class="L4322" rel="L4322">she could not help crying out:</li>
<li class="L4323" rel="L4323"></li>
<li class="L4324" rel="L4324">“Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte--impossible!”</li>
<li class="L4325" rel="L4325"></li>
<li class="L4326" rel="L4326">The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her</li>
<li class="L4327" rel="L4327">story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a</li>
<li class="L4328" rel="L4328">reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained</li>
<li class="L4329" rel="L4329">her composure, and calmly replied:</li>
<li class="L4330" rel="L4330"></li>
<li class="L4331" rel="L4331">“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible</li>
<li class="L4332" rel="L4332">that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman&#39;s good opinion,</li>
<li class="L4333" rel="L4333">because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”</li>
<li class="L4334" rel="L4334"></li>
<li class="L4335" rel="L4335">But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort</li>
<li class="L4336" rel="L4336">for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of</li>
<li class="L4337" rel="L4337">their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her</li>
<li class="L4338" rel="L4338">all imaginable happiness.</li>
<li class="L4339" rel="L4339"></li>
<li class="L4340" rel="L4340">“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte. “You must be surprised,</li>
<li class="L4341" rel="L4341">very much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry</li>
<li class="L4342" rel="L4342">you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be</li>
<li class="L4343" rel="L4343">satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never</li>
<li class="L4344" rel="L4344">was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins&#39;s</li>
<li class="L4345" rel="L4345">character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my</li>
<li class="L4346" rel="L4346">chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on</li>
<li class="L4347" rel="L4347">entering the marriage state.”</li>
<li class="L4348" rel="L4348"></li>
<li class="L4349" rel="L4349">Elizabeth quietly answered “Undoubtedly;” and after an awkward pause,</li>
<li class="L4350" rel="L4350">they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much</li>
<li class="L4351" rel="L4351">longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.</li>
<li class="L4352" rel="L4352">It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so</li>
<li class="L4353" rel="L4353">unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins&#39;s making two offers</li>
<li class="L4354" rel="L4354">of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now</li>
<li class="L4355" rel="L4355">accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte&#39;s opinion of matrimony was</li>
<li class="L4356" rel="L4356">not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible</li>
<li class="L4357" rel="L4357">that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better</li>
<li class="L4358" rel="L4358">feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a</li>
<li class="L4359" rel="L4359">most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself</li>
<li class="L4360" rel="L4360">and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it</li>
<li class="L4361" rel="L4361">was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had</li>
<li class="L4362" rel="L4362">chosen.</li>
<li class="L4363" rel="L4363"></li>
<li class="L4364" rel="L4364"></li>

<li class="L4367" rel="L4367"></li>
<li class="L4368" rel="L4368"></li>
<li class="L4369" rel="L4369">Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what</li>
<li class="L4370" rel="L4370">she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention</li>
<li class="L4371" rel="L4371">it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to</li>
<li class="L4372" rel="L4372">announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,</li>
<li class="L4373" rel="L4373">and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the</li>
<li class="L4374" rel="L4374">houses, he unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely wondering, but</li>
<li class="L4375" rel="L4375">incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness,</li>
<li class="L4376" rel="L4376">protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and</li>
<li class="L4377" rel="L4377">often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:</li>
<li class="L4378" rel="L4378"></li>
<li class="L4379" rel="L4379">“Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know</li>
<li class="L4380" rel="L4380">that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”</li>
<li class="L4381" rel="L4381"></li>
<li class="L4382" rel="L4382">Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne</li>
<li class="L4383" rel="L4383">without anger such treatment; but Sir William&#39;s good breeding carried</li>
<li class="L4384" rel="L4384">him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the</li>
<li class="L4385" rel="L4385">truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the</li>
<li class="L4386" rel="L4386">most forbearing courtesy.</li>
<li class="L4387" rel="L4387"></li>
<li class="L4388" rel="L4388">Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant</li>
<li class="L4389" rel="L4389">a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by</li>
<li class="L4390" rel="L4390">mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and</li>
<li class="L4391" rel="L4391">endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters</li>
<li class="L4392" rel="L4392">by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she</li>
<li class="L4393" rel="L4393">was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the</li>
<li class="L4394" rel="L4394">happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character</li>
<li class="L4395" rel="L4395">of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.</li>
<li class="L4396" rel="L4396"></li>
<li class="L4397" rel="L4397">Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while</li>
<li class="L4398" rel="L4398">Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings</li>
<li class="L4399" rel="L4399">found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving</li>
<li class="L4400" rel="L4400">the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins</li>
<li class="L4401" rel="L4401">had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be</li>
<li class="L4402" rel="L4402">happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two</li>
<li class="L4403" rel="L4403">inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that</li>
<li class="L4404" rel="L4404">Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she</li>
<li class="L4405" rel="L4405">herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two</li>
<li class="L4406" rel="L4406">points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could</li>
<li class="L4407" rel="L4407">console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her</li>
<li class="L4408" rel="L4408">resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without</li>
<li class="L4409" rel="L4409">scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William</li>
<li class="L4410" rel="L4410">or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she</li>
<li class="L4411" rel="L4411">could at all forgive their daughter.</li>
<li class="L4412" rel="L4412"></li>
<li class="L4413" rel="L4413">Mr. Bennet&#39;s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such</li>
<li class="L4414" rel="L4414">as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for</li>
<li class="L4415" rel="L4415">it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had</li>
<li class="L4416" rel="L4416">been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and</li>
<li class="L4417" rel="L4417">more foolish than his daughter!</li>
<li class="L4418" rel="L4418"></li>
<li class="L4419" rel="L4419">Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said</li>
<li class="L4420" rel="L4420">less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;</li>
<li class="L4421" rel="L4421">nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty</li>
<li class="L4422" rel="L4422">and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a</li>
<li class="L4423" rel="L4423">clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news</li>
<li class="L4424" rel="L4424">to spread at Meryton.</li>
<li class="L4425" rel="L4425"></li>
<li class="L4426" rel="L4426">Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort</li>
<li class="L4427" rel="L4427">on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she</li>
<li class="L4428" rel="L4428">called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,</li>
<li class="L4429" rel="L4429">though Mrs. Bennet&#39;s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been</li>
<li class="L4430" rel="L4430">enough to drive happiness away.</li>
<li class="L4431" rel="L4431"></li>
<li class="L4432" rel="L4432">Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them</li>
<li class="L4433" rel="L4433">mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that</li>
<li class="L4434" rel="L4434">no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her</li>
<li class="L4435" rel="L4435">disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her</li>
<li class="L4436" rel="L4436">sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could</li>
<li class="L4437" rel="L4437">never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious,</li>
<li class="L4438" rel="L4438">as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his</li>
<li class="L4439" rel="L4439">return.</li>
<li class="L4440" rel="L4440"></li>
<li class="L4441" rel="L4441">Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting</li>
<li class="L4442" rel="L4442">the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised</li>
<li class="L4443" rel="L4443">letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to</li>
<li class="L4444" rel="L4444">their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a</li>
<li class="L4445" rel="L4445">twelvemonth&#39;s abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging</li>
<li class="L4446" rel="L4446">his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many</li>
<li class="L4447" rel="L4447">rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection</li>
<li class="L4448" rel="L4448">of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was</li>
<li class="L4449" rel="L4449">merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready</li>
<li class="L4450" rel="L4450">to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither</li>
<li class="L4451" rel="L4451">he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,</li>
<li class="L4452" rel="L4452">he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take</li>
<li class="L4453" rel="L4453">place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable</li>
<li class="L4454" rel="L4454">argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him</li>
<li class="L4455" rel="L4455">the happiest of men.</li>
<li class="L4456" rel="L4456"></li>
<li class="L4457" rel="L4457">Mr. Collins&#39;s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of</li>
<li class="L4458" rel="L4458">pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to</li>
<li class="L4459" rel="L4459">complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come</li>
<li class="L4460" rel="L4460">to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient</li>
<li class="L4461" rel="L4461">and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house</li>
<li class="L4462" rel="L4462">while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the</li>
<li class="L4463" rel="L4463">most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and</li>
<li class="L4464" rel="L4464">they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley&#39;s continued</li>
<li class="L4465" rel="L4465">absence.</li>
<li class="L4466" rel="L4466"></li>
<li class="L4467" rel="L4467">Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after</li>
<li class="L4468" rel="L4468">day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the</li>
<li class="L4469" rel="L4469">report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to</li>
<li class="L4470" rel="L4470">Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.</li>
<li class="L4471" rel="L4471">Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous</li>
<li class="L4472" rel="L4472">falsehood.</li>
<li class="L4473" rel="L4473"></li>
<li class="L4474" rel="L4474">Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that</li>
<li class="L4475" rel="L4475">his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as</li>
<li class="L4476" rel="L4476">she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane&#39;s happiness, and so</li>
<li class="L4477" rel="L4477">dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its</li>
<li class="L4478" rel="L4478">frequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters</li>
<li class="L4479" rel="L4479">and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss</li>
<li class="L4480" rel="L4480">Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for</li>
<li class="L4481" rel="L4481">the strength of his attachment.</li>
<li class="L4482" rel="L4482"></li>
<li class="L4483" rel="L4483">As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more</li>
<li class="L4484" rel="L4484">painful than Elizabeth&#39;s, but whatever she felt she was desirous of</li>
<li class="L4485" rel="L4485">concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject</li>
<li class="L4486" rel="L4486">was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother,</li>
<li class="L4487" rel="L4487">an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her</li>
<li class="L4488" rel="L4488">impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he</li>
<li class="L4489" rel="L4489">did not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed</li>
<li class="L4490" rel="L4490">all Jane&#39;s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable</li>
<li class="L4491" rel="L4491">tranquillity.</li>
<li class="L4492" rel="L4492"></li>
<li class="L4493" rel="L4493">Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his</li>
<li class="L4494" rel="L4494">reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his</li>
<li class="L4495" rel="L4495">first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;</li>
<li class="L4496" rel="L4496">and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them</li>
<li class="L4497" rel="L4497">from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by</li>
<li class="L4498" rel="L4498">him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time</li>
<li class="L4499" rel="L4499">to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.</li>
<li class="L4500" rel="L4500"></li>
<li class="L4501" rel="L4501">Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of</li>
<li class="L4502" rel="L4502">anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour,</li>
<li class="L4503" rel="L4503">and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight</li>
<li class="L4504" rel="L4504">of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she</li>
<li class="L4505" rel="L4505">regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see</li>
<li class="L4506" rel="L4506">them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and</li>
<li class="L4507" rel="L4507">whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that</li>
<li class="L4508" rel="L4508">they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself</li>
<li class="L4509" rel="L4509">and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She</li>
<li class="L4510" rel="L4510">complained bitterly of all this to her husband.</li>
<li class="L4511" rel="L4511"></li>
<li class="L4512" rel="L4512">“Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that Charlotte</li>
<li class="L4513" rel="L4513">Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to</li>
<li class="L4514" rel="L4514">make way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it!”</li>
<li class="L4515" rel="L4515"></li>
<li class="L4516" rel="L4516">“My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for</li>
<li class="L4517" rel="L4517">better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.”</li>
<li class="L4518" rel="L4518"></li>
<li class="L4519" rel="L4519">This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of</li>
<li class="L4520" rel="L4520">making any answer, she went on as before.</li>
<li class="L4521" rel="L4521"></li>
<li class="L4522" rel="L4522">“I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was</li>
<li class="L4523" rel="L4523">not for the entail, I should not mind it.”</li>
<li class="L4524" rel="L4524"></li>
<li class="L4525" rel="L4525">“What should not you mind?”</li>
<li class="L4526" rel="L4526"></li>
<li class="L4527" rel="L4527">“I should not mind anything at all.”</li>
<li class="L4528" rel="L4528"></li>
<li class="L4529" rel="L4529">“Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such</li>
<li class="L4530" rel="L4530">insensibility.”</li>
<li class="L4531" rel="L4531"></li>
<li class="L4532" rel="L4532">“I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How</li>
<li class="L4533" rel="L4533">anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one&#39;s own</li>
<li class="L4534" rel="L4534">daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!</li>
<li class="L4535" rel="L4535">Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?”</li>
<li class="L4536" rel="L4536"></li>
<li class="L4537" rel="L4537">“I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.</li>
<li class="L4538" rel="L4538"></li>
<li class="L4539" rel="L4539"></li>
<li class="L4540" rel="L4540"></li>
<li class="L4541" rel="L4541">Chapter 24</li>
<li class="L4542" rel="L4542"></li>
<li class="L4543" rel="L4543"></li>
<li class="L4544" rel="L4544">Miss Bingley&#39;s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first</li>
<li class="L4545" rel="L4545">sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for</li>
<li class="L4546" rel="L4546">the winter, and concluded with her brother&#39;s regret at not having had</li>
<li class="L4547" rel="L4547">time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left</li>
<li class="L4548" rel="L4548">the country.</li>
<li class="L4549" rel="L4549"></li>
<li class="L4550" rel="L4550">Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest</li>
<li class="L4551" rel="L4551">of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the</li>
<li class="L4552" rel="L4552">writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy&#39;s praise occupied</li>
<li class="L4553" rel="L4553">the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline</li>
<li class="L4554" rel="L4554">boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict</li>
<li class="L4555" rel="L4555">the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former</li>
<li class="L4556" rel="L4556">letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother&#39;s being an</li>
<li class="L4557" rel="L4557">inmate of Mr. Darcy&#39;s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of</li>
<li class="L4558" rel="L4558">the latter with regard to new furniture.</li>
<li class="L4559" rel="L4559"></li>
<li class="L4560" rel="L4560">Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,</li>
<li class="L4561" rel="L4561">heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern</li>
<li class="L4562" rel="L4562">for her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline&#39;s</li>
<li class="L4563" rel="L4563">assertion of her brother&#39;s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no</li>
<li class="L4564" rel="L4564">credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she</li>
<li class="L4565" rel="L4565">had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she</li>
<li class="L4566" rel="L4566">could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness</li>
<li class="L4567" rel="L4567">of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave</li>
<li class="L4568" rel="L4568">of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness</li>
<li class="L4569" rel="L4569">to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however,</li>
<li class="L4570" rel="L4570">been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in</li>
<li class="L4571" rel="L4571">whatever manner he thought best, but her sister&#39;s was involved in it, as</li>
<li class="L4572" rel="L4572">she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short,</li>
<li class="L4573" rel="L4573">on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She</li>
<li class="L4574" rel="L4574">could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley&#39;s regard had really</li>
<li class="L4575" rel="L4575">died away, or were suppressed by his friends&#39; interference; whether</li>
<li class="L4576" rel="L4576">he had been aware of Jane&#39;s attachment, or whether it had escaped his</li>
<li class="L4577" rel="L4577">observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be</li>
<li class="L4578" rel="L4578">materially affected by the difference, her sister&#39;s situation remained</li>
<li class="L4579" rel="L4579">the same, her peace equally wounded.</li>
<li class="L4580" rel="L4580"></li>
<li class="L4581" rel="L4581">A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to</li>
<li class="L4582" rel="L4582">Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet&#39;s leaving them together, after a</li>
<li class="L4583" rel="L4583">longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could</li>
<li class="L4584" rel="L4584">not help saying:</li>
<li class="L4585" rel="L4585"></li>
<li class="L4586" rel="L4586">“Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no</li>
<li class="L4587" rel="L4587">idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But</li>
<li class="L4588" rel="L4588">I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall</li>
<li class="L4589" rel="L4589">all be as we were before.”</li>
<li class="L4590" rel="L4590"></li>
<li class="L4591" rel="L4591">Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said</li>
<li class="L4592" rel="L4592">nothing.</li>
<li class="L4593" rel="L4593"></li>
<li class="L4594" rel="L4594">“You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have</li>
<li class="L4595" rel="L4595">no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my</li>
<li class="L4596" rel="L4596">acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear,</li>
<li class="L4597" rel="L4597">and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not _that_ pain. A</li>
<li class="L4598" rel="L4598">little time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better.”</li>
<li class="L4599" rel="L4599"></li>
<li class="L4600" rel="L4600">With a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort immediately,</li>
<li class="L4601" rel="L4601">that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it</li>
<li class="L4602" rel="L4602">has done no harm to anyone but myself.”</li>
<li class="L4603" rel="L4603"></li>
<li class="L4604" rel="L4604">“My dear Jane!” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good. Your sweetness</li>
<li class="L4605" rel="L4605">and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say</li>
<li class="L4606" rel="L4606">to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you</li>
<li class="L4607" rel="L4607">deserve.”</li>
<li class="L4608" rel="L4608"></li>
<li class="L4609" rel="L4609">Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back</li>
<li class="L4610" rel="L4610">the praise on her sister&#39;s warm affection.</li>
<li class="L4611" rel="L4611"></li>
<li class="L4612" rel="L4612">“Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the</li>
<li class="L4613" rel="L4613">world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want</li>
<li class="L4614" rel="L4614">to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not</li>
<li class="L4615" rel="L4615">be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your</li>
<li class="L4616" rel="L4616">privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people</li>
<li class="L4617" rel="L4617">whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see</li>
<li class="L4618" rel="L4618">of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms</li>
<li class="L4619" rel="L4619">my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the</li>
<li class="L4620" rel="L4620">little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or</li>
<li class="L4621" rel="L4621">sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the</li>
<li class="L4622" rel="L4622">other is Charlotte&#39;s marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is</li>
<li class="L4623" rel="L4623">unaccountable!”</li>
<li class="L4624" rel="L4624"></li>
<li class="L4625" rel="L4625">“My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will</li>
<li class="L4626" rel="L4626">ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference</li>
<li class="L4627" rel="L4627">of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins&#39;s respectability, and</li>
<li class="L4628" rel="L4628">Charlotte&#39;s steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a</li>
<li class="L4629" rel="L4629">large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be</li>
<li class="L4630" rel="L4630">ready to believe, for everybody&#39;s sake, that she may feel something like</li>
<li class="L4631" rel="L4631">regard and esteem for our cousin.”</li>
<li class="L4632" rel="L4632"></li>
<li class="L4633" rel="L4633">“To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else</li>
<li class="L4634" rel="L4634">could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that</li>
<li class="L4635" rel="L4635">Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her</li>
<li class="L4636" rel="L4636">understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a</li>
<li class="L4637" rel="L4637">conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as</li>
<li class="L4638" rel="L4638">I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him</li>
<li class="L4639" rel="L4639">cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though</li>
<li class="L4640" rel="L4640">it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,</li>
<li class="L4641" rel="L4641">change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade</li>
<li class="L4642" rel="L4642">yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of</li>
<li class="L4643" rel="L4643">danger security for happiness.”</li>
<li class="L4644" rel="L4644"></li>
<li class="L4645" rel="L4645">“I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,” replied</li>
<li class="L4646" rel="L4646">Jane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy</li>
<li class="L4647" rel="L4647">together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You</li>
<li class="L4648" rel="L4648">mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat</li>
<li class="L4649" rel="L4649">you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and</li>
<li class="L4650" rel="L4650">saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy</li>
<li class="L4651" rel="L4651">ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man</li>
<li class="L4652" rel="L4652">to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but</li>
<li class="L4653" rel="L4653">our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than</li>
<li class="L4654" rel="L4654">it does.”</li>
<li class="L4655" rel="L4655"></li>
<li class="L4656" rel="L4656">“And men take care that they should.”</li>
<li class="L4657" rel="L4657"></li>
<li class="L4658" rel="L4658">“If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea</li>
<li class="L4659" rel="L4659">of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.”</li>
<li class="L4660" rel="L4660"></li>
<li class="L4661" rel="L4661">“I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley&#39;s conduct to design,”</li>
<li class="L4662" rel="L4662"> said Elizabeth; “but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others</li>
<li class="L4663" rel="L4663">unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,</li>
<li class="L4664" rel="L4664">want of attention to other people&#39;s feelings, and want of resolution,</li>
<li class="L4665" rel="L4665">will do the business.”</li>
<li class="L4666" rel="L4666"></li>
<li class="L4667" rel="L4667">“And do you impute it to either of those?”</li>
<li class="L4668" rel="L4668"></li>
<li class="L4669" rel="L4669">“Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what</li>
<li class="L4670" rel="L4670">I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.”</li>
<li class="L4671" rel="L4671"></li>
<li class="L4672" rel="L4672">“You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?”</li>
<li class="L4673" rel="L4673"></li>
<li class="L4674" rel="L4674">“Yes, in conjunction with his friend.”</li>
<li class="L4675" rel="L4675"></li>
<li class="L4676" rel="L4676">“I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can</li>
<li class="L4677" rel="L4677">only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can</li>
<li class="L4678" rel="L4678">secure it.”</li>
<li class="L4679" rel="L4679"></li>
<li class="L4680" rel="L4680">“Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his</li>
<li class="L4681" rel="L4681">happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they</li>
<li class="L4682" rel="L4682">may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great</li>
<li class="L4683" rel="L4683">connections, and pride.”</li>
<li class="L4684" rel="L4684"></li>
<li class="L4685" rel="L4685">“Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to choose Miss Darcy,” replied Jane;</li>
<li class="L4686" rel="L4686">“but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have</li>
<li class="L4687" rel="L4687">known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love</li>
<li class="L4688" rel="L4688">her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely</li>
<li class="L4689" rel="L4689">they should have opposed their brother&#39;s. What sister would think</li>
<li class="L4690" rel="L4690">herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very</li>
<li class="L4691" rel="L4691">objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try</li>
<li class="L4692" rel="L4692">to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an</li>
<li class="L4693" rel="L4693">affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most</li>
<li class="L4694" rel="L4694">unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been</li>
<li class="L4695" rel="L4695">mistaken--or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what</li>
<li class="L4696" rel="L4696">I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in</li>
<li class="L4697" rel="L4697">the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”</li>
<li class="L4698" rel="L4698"></li>
<li class="L4699" rel="L4699">Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley&#39;s</li>
<li class="L4700" rel="L4700">name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.</li>
<li class="L4701" rel="L4701"></li>
<li class="L4702" rel="L4702">Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no</li>
<li class="L4703" rel="L4703">more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account</li>
<li class="L4704" rel="L4704">for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with</li>
<li class="L4705" rel="L4705">less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she</li>
<li class="L4706" rel="L4706">did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the</li>
<li class="L4707" rel="L4707">effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her</li>
<li class="L4708" rel="L4708">no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at</li>
<li class="L4709" rel="L4709">the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet&#39;s best</li>
<li class="L4710" rel="L4710">comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.</li>
<li class="L4711" rel="L4711"></li>
<li class="L4712" rel="L4712">Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. “So, Lizzy,” said he one day,</li>
<li class="L4713" rel="L4713">“your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to</li>
<li class="L4714" rel="L4714">being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then.</li>
<li class="L4715" rel="L4715">It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction</li>
<li class="L4716" rel="L4716">among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to</li>
<li class="L4717" rel="L4717">be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in</li>
<li class="L4718" rel="L4718">Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham</li>
<li class="L4719" rel="L4719">be _your_ man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”</li>
<li class="L4720" rel="L4720"></li>
<li class="L4721" rel="L4721">“Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not</li>
<li class="L4722" rel="L4722">all expect Jane&#39;s good fortune.”</li>
<li class="L4723" rel="L4723"></li>
<li class="L4724" rel="L4724">“True,” said Mr. Bennet, “but it is a comfort to think that whatever of</li>
<li class="L4725" rel="L4725">that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make</li>
<li class="L4726" rel="L4726">the most of it.”</li>
<li class="L4727" rel="L4727"></li>
<li class="L4728" rel="L4728">Mr. Wickham&#39;s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom</li>
<li class="L4729" rel="L4729">which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn</li>
<li class="L4730" rel="L4730">family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now</li>
<li class="L4731" rel="L4731">added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already</li>
<li class="L4732" rel="L4732">heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,</li>
<li class="L4733" rel="L4733">was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was</li>
<li class="L4734" rel="L4734">pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they</li>
<li class="L4735" rel="L4735">had known anything of the matter.</li>
<li class="L4736" rel="L4736"></li>
<li class="L4737" rel="L4737">Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be</li>
<li class="L4738" rel="L4738">any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society</li>
<li class="L4739" rel="L4739">of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for</li>
<li class="L4740" rel="L4740">allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else</li>
<li class="L4741" rel="L4741">Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.</li>
<li class="L4742" rel="L4742"></li>
<li class="L4743" rel="L4743"></li>

<li class="L4746" rel="L4746"></li>
<li class="L4747" rel="L4747"></li>
<li class="L4748" rel="L4748">After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity,</li>
<li class="L4749" rel="L4749">Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of</li>
<li class="L4750" rel="L4750">Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his</li>
<li class="L4751" rel="L4751">side, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason</li>
<li class="L4752" rel="L4752">to hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would</li>
<li class="L4753" rel="L4753">be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his</li>
<li class="L4754" rel="L4754">relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair</li>
<li class="L4755" rel="L4755">cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another</li>
<li class="L4756" rel="L4756">letter of thanks.</li>
<li class="L4757" rel="L4757"></li>
<li class="L4758" rel="L4758">On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving</li>
<li class="L4759" rel="L4759">her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas</li>
<li class="L4760" rel="L4760">at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly</li>
<li class="L4761" rel="L4761">superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield</li>
<li class="L4762" rel="L4762">ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived</li>
<li class="L4763" rel="L4763">by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so</li>
<li class="L4764" rel="L4764">well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger</li>
<li class="L4765" rel="L4765">than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant</li>
<li class="L4766" rel="L4766">woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the</li>
<li class="L4767" rel="L4767">two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard.</li>
<li class="L4768" rel="L4768">They had frequently been staying with her in town.</li>
<li class="L4769" rel="L4769"></li>
<li class="L4770" rel="L4770">The first part of Mrs. Gardiner&#39;s business on her arrival was to</li>
<li class="L4771" rel="L4771">distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was</li>
<li class="L4772" rel="L4772">done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.</li>
<li class="L4773" rel="L4773">Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They</li>
<li class="L4774" rel="L4774">had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her</li>
<li class="L4775" rel="L4775">girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was</li>
<li class="L4776" rel="L4776">nothing in it.</li>
<li class="L4777" rel="L4777"></li>
<li class="L4778" rel="L4778">“I do not blame Jane,” she continued, “for Jane would have got Mr.</li>
<li class="L4779" rel="L4779">Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think</li>
<li class="L4780" rel="L4780">that she might have been Mr. Collins&#39;s wife by this time, had it not</li>
<li class="L4781" rel="L4781">been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,</li>
<li class="L4782" rel="L4782">and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have</li>
<li class="L4783" rel="L4783">a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just</li>
<li class="L4784" rel="L4784">as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed,</li>
<li class="L4785" rel="L4785">sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of</li>
<li class="L4786" rel="L4786">them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted</li>
<li class="L4787" rel="L4787">so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves</li>
<li class="L4788" rel="L4788">before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the</li>
<li class="L4789" rel="L4789">greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of</li>
<li class="L4790" rel="L4790">long sleeves.”</li>
<li class="L4791" rel="L4791"></li>
<li class="L4792" rel="L4792">Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before,</li>
<li class="L4793" rel="L4793">in the course of Jane and Elizabeth&#39;s correspondence with her, made her</li>
<li class="L4794" rel="L4794">sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the</li>
<li class="L4795" rel="L4795">conversation.</li>
<li class="L4796" rel="L4796"></li>
<li class="L4797" rel="L4797">When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. “It</li>
<li class="L4798" rel="L4798">seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,” said she. “I am</li>
<li class="L4799" rel="L4799">sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such</li>
<li class="L4800" rel="L4800">as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl</li>
<li class="L4801" rel="L4801">for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets</li>
<li class="L4802" rel="L4802">her, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.”</li>
<li class="L4803" rel="L4803"></li>
<li class="L4804" rel="L4804">“An excellent consolation in its way,” said Elizabeth, “but it will not</li>
<li class="L4805" rel="L4805">do for _us_. We do not suffer by _accident_. It does not often</li>
<li class="L4806" rel="L4806">happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of</li>
<li class="L4807" rel="L4807">independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in</li>
<li class="L4808" rel="L4808">love with only a few days before.”</li>
<li class="L4809" rel="L4809"></li>
<li class="L4810" rel="L4810">“But that expression of &#39;violently in love&#39; is so hackneyed, so</li>
<li class="L4811" rel="L4811">doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as</li>
<li class="L4812" rel="L4812">often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour&#39;s acquaintance,</li>
<li class="L4813" rel="L4813">as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley&#39;s</li>
<li class="L4814" rel="L4814">love?”</li>
<li class="L4815" rel="L4815"></li>
<li class="L4816" rel="L4816">“I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite</li>
<li class="L4817" rel="L4817">inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time</li>
<li class="L4818" rel="L4818">they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he</li>
<li class="L4819" rel="L4819">offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I</li>
<li class="L4820" rel="L4820">spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be</li>
<li class="L4821" rel="L4821">finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?”</li>
<li class="L4822" rel="L4822"></li>
<li class="L4823" rel="L4823">“Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor</li>
<li class="L4824" rel="L4824">Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get</li>
<li class="L4825" rel="L4825">over it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you</li>
<li class="L4826" rel="L4826">would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she</li>
<li class="L4827" rel="L4827">would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be</li>
<li class="L4828" rel="L4828">of service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as</li>
<li class="L4829" rel="L4829">anything.”</li>
<li class="L4830" rel="L4830"></li>
<li class="L4831" rel="L4831">Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded</li>
<li class="L4832" rel="L4832">of her sister&#39;s ready acquiescence.</li>
<li class="L4833" rel="L4833"></li>
<li class="L4834" rel="L4834">“I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with regard to</li>
<li class="L4835" rel="L4835">this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of</li>
<li class="L4836" rel="L4836">town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go</li>
<li class="L4837" rel="L4837">out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all,</li>
<li class="L4838" rel="L4838">unless he really comes to see her.”</li>
<li class="L4839" rel="L4839"></li>
<li class="L4840" rel="L4840">“And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his</li>
<li class="L4841" rel="L4841">friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such</li>
<li class="L4842" rel="L4842">a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may</li>
<li class="L4843" rel="L4843">perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he</li>
<li class="L4844" rel="L4844">would hardly think a month&#39;s ablution enough to cleanse him from its</li>
<li class="L4845" rel="L4845">impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley</li>
<li class="L4846" rel="L4846">never stirs without him.”</li>
<li class="L4847" rel="L4847"></li>
<li class="L4848" rel="L4848">“So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane</li>
<li class="L4849" rel="L4849">correspond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.”</li>
<li class="L4850" rel="L4850"></li>
<li class="L4851" rel="L4851">“She will drop the acquaintance entirely.”</li>
<li class="L4852" rel="L4852"></li>
<li class="L4853" rel="L4853">But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this</li>
<li class="L4854" rel="L4854">point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley&#39;s being</li>
<li class="L4855" rel="L4855">withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which</li>
<li class="L4856" rel="L4856">convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely</li>
<li class="L4857" rel="L4857">hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that</li>
<li class="L4858" rel="L4858">his affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends</li>
<li class="L4859" rel="L4859">successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane&#39;s</li>
<li class="L4860" rel="L4860">attractions.</li>
<li class="L4861" rel="L4861"></li>
<li class="L4862" rel="L4862">Miss Bennet accepted her aunt&#39;s invitation with pleasure; and the</li>
<li class="L4863" rel="L4863">Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she</li>
<li class="L4864" rel="L4864">hoped by Caroline&#39;s not living in the same house with her brother,</li>
<li class="L4865" rel="L4865">she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of</li>
<li class="L4866" rel="L4866">seeing him.</li>
<li class="L4867" rel="L4867"></li>
<li class="L4868" rel="L4868">The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses,</li>
<li class="L4869" rel="L4869">the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its</li>
<li class="L4870" rel="L4870">engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment</li>
<li class="L4871" rel="L4871">of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family</li>
<li class="L4872" rel="L4872">dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always</li>
<li class="L4873" rel="L4873">made part of it--of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and</li>
<li class="L4874" rel="L4874">on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth&#39;s</li>
<li class="L4875" rel="L4875">warm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them,</li>
<li class="L4876" rel="L4876">from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference</li>
<li class="L4877" rel="L4877">of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and</li>
<li class="L4878" rel="L4878">she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left</li>
<li class="L4879" rel="L4879">Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such</li>
<li class="L4880" rel="L4880">an attachment.</li>
<li class="L4881" rel="L4881"></li>
<li class="L4882" rel="L4882">To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,</li>
<li class="L4883" rel="L4883">unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,</li>
<li class="L4884" rel="L4884">before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very</li>
<li class="L4885" rel="L4885">part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many</li>
<li class="L4886" rel="L4886">acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since</li>
<li class="L4887" rel="L4887">the death of Darcy&#39;s father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher</li>
<li class="L4888" rel="L4888">intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of</li>
<li class="L4889" rel="L4889">procuring.</li>
<li class="L4890" rel="L4890"></li>
<li class="L4891" rel="L4891">Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by</li>
<li class="L4892" rel="L4892">character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject</li>
<li class="L4893" rel="L4893">of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute</li>
<li class="L4894" rel="L4894">description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of</li>
<li class="L4895" rel="L4895">praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both</li>
<li class="L4896" rel="L4896">him and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy&#39;s</li>
<li class="L4897" rel="L4897">treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman&#39;s</li>
<li class="L4898" rel="L4898">reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and</li>
<li class="L4899" rel="L4899">was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam</li>
<li class="L4900" rel="L4900">Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.</li>
<li class="L4901" rel="L4901"></li>

<li class="L4903" rel="L4903"></li>
<li class="L4904" rel="L4904">Chapter 26</li>
<li class="L4905" rel="L4905"></li>
<li class="L4906" rel="L4906"></li>
<li class="L4907" rel="L4907">Mrs. Gardiner&#39;s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given</li>
<li class="L4908" rel="L4908">on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after</li>
<li class="L4909" rel="L4909">honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:</li>
<li class="L4910" rel="L4910"></li>
<li class="L4911" rel="L4911">“You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because</li>
<li class="L4912" rel="L4912">you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking</li>
<li class="L4913" rel="L4913">openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve</li>
<li class="L4914" rel="L4914">yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want</li>
<li class="L4915" rel="L4915">of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against</li>
<li class="L4916" rel="L4916">_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he</li>
<li class="L4917" rel="L4917">ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you</li>
<li class="L4918" rel="L4918">must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all</li>
<li class="L4919" rel="L4919">expect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and</li>
<li class="L4920" rel="L4920">good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.”</li>
<li class="L4921" rel="L4921"></li>
<li class="L4922" rel="L4922">“My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”</li>
<li class="L4923" rel="L4923"></li>
<li class="L4924" rel="L4924">“Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”</li>
<li class="L4925" rel="L4925"></li>
<li class="L4926" rel="L4926">“Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of</li>
<li class="L4927" rel="L4927">myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I</li>
<li class="L4928" rel="L4928">can prevent it.”</li>
<li class="L4929" rel="L4929"></li>
<li class="L4930" rel="L4930">“Elizabeth, you are not serious now.”</li>
<li class="L4931" rel="L4931"></li>
<li class="L4932" rel="L4932">“I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with</li>
<li class="L4933" rel="L4933">Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,</li>
<li class="L4934" rel="L4934">the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to</li>
<li class="L4935" rel="L4935">me--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence</li>
<li class="L4936" rel="L4936">of it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father&#39;s opinion of me does</li>
<li class="L4937" rel="L4937">me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My</li>
<li class="L4938" rel="L4938">father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I</li>
<li class="L4939" rel="L4939">should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but</li>
<li class="L4940" rel="L4940">since we see every day that where there is affection, young people</li>
<li class="L4941" rel="L4941">are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into</li>
<li class="L4942" rel="L4942">engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many</li>
<li class="L4943" rel="L4943">of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it</li>
<li class="L4944" rel="L4944">would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not</li>
<li class="L4945" rel="L4945">to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first</li>
<li class="L4946" rel="L4946">object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short,</li>
<li class="L4947" rel="L4947">I will do my best.”</li>
<li class="L4948" rel="L4948"></li>
<li class="L4949" rel="L4949">“Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very</li>
<li class="L4950" rel="L4950">often. At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.”</li>
<li class="L4951" rel="L4951"></li>
<li class="L4952" rel="L4952">“As I did the other day,” said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: “very</li>
<li class="L4953" rel="L4953">true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine</li>
<li class="L4954" rel="L4954">that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been</li>
<li class="L4955" rel="L4955">so frequently invited this week. You know my mother&#39;s ideas as to the</li>
<li class="L4956" rel="L4956">necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my</li>
<li class="L4957" rel="L4957">honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope</li>
<li class="L4958" rel="L4958">you are satisfied.”</li>
<li class="L4959" rel="L4959"></li>
<li class="L4960" rel="L4960">Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for</li>
<li class="L4961" rel="L4961">the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice</li>
<li class="L4962" rel="L4962">being given on such a point, without being resented.</li>
<li class="L4963" rel="L4963"></li>
<li class="L4964" rel="L4964">Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted</li>
<li class="L4965" rel="L4965">by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,</li>
<li class="L4966" rel="L4966">his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was</li>
<li class="L4967" rel="L4967">now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think</li>
<li class="L4968" rel="L4968">it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that</li>
<li class="L4969" rel="L4969">she “_wished_ they might be happy.” Thursday was to be the wedding day,</li>
<li class="L4970" rel="L4970">and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she</li>
<li class="L4971" rel="L4971">rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother&#39;s ungracious and</li>
<li class="L4972" rel="L4972">reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her</li>
<li class="L4973" rel="L4973">out of the room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:</li>
<li class="L4974" rel="L4974"></li>
<li class="L4975" rel="L4975">“I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.”</li>
<li class="L4976" rel="L4976"></li>
<li class="L4977" rel="L4977">“_That_ you certainly shall.”</li>
<li class="L4978" rel="L4978"></li>
<li class="L4979" rel="L4979">“And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?”</li>
<li class="L4980" rel="L4980"></li>
<li class="L4981" rel="L4981">“We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.”</li>
<li class="L4982" rel="L4982"></li>
<li class="L4983" rel="L4983">“I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to</li>
<li class="L4984" rel="L4984">come to Hunsford.”</li>
<li class="L4985" rel="L4985"></li>
<li class="L4986" rel="L4986">Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the</li>
<li class="L4987" rel="L4987">visit.</li>
<li class="L4988" rel="L4988"></li>
<li class="L4989" rel="L4989">“My father and Maria are coming to me in March,” added Charlotte, “and I</li>
<li class="L4990" rel="L4990">hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as</li>
<li class="L4991" rel="L4991">welcome as either of them.”</li>
<li class="L4992" rel="L4992"></li>
<li class="L4993" rel="L4993">The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from</li>
<li class="L4994" rel="L4994">the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on</li>
<li class="L4995" rel="L4995">the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their</li>
<li class="L4996" rel="L4996">correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that</li>
<li class="L4997" rel="L4997">it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never</li>
<li class="L4998" rel="L4998">address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,</li>
<li class="L4999" rel="L4999">and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the</li>
<li class="L5000" rel="L5000">sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte&#39;s first letters</li>
<li class="L5001" rel="L5001">were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be</li>
<li class="L5002" rel="L5002">curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would</li>
<li class="L5003" rel="L5003">like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to</li>
<li class="L5004" rel="L5004">be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte</li>
<li class="L5005" rel="L5005">expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She</li>
<li class="L5006" rel="L5006">wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing</li>
<li class="L5007" rel="L5007">which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and</li>
<li class="L5008" rel="L5008">roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine&#39;s behaviour was most</li>
<li class="L5009" rel="L5009">friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins&#39;s picture of Hunsford and</li>
<li class="L5010" rel="L5010">Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait</li>
<li class="L5011" rel="L5011">for her own visit there to know the rest.</li>
<li class="L5012" rel="L5012"></li>
<li class="L5013" rel="L5013">Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their</li>
<li class="L5014" rel="L5014">safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it</li>
<li class="L5015" rel="L5015">would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.</li>
<li class="L5016" rel="L5016"></li>
<li class="L5017" rel="L5017">Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience</li>
<li class="L5018" rel="L5018">generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or</li>
<li class="L5019" rel="L5019">hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that</li>
<li class="L5020" rel="L5020">her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been</li>
<li class="L5021" rel="L5021">lost.</li>
<li class="L5022" rel="L5022"></li>
<li class="L5023" rel="L5023">“My aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of the</li>
<li class="L5024" rel="L5024">town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.”</li>
<li class="L5025" rel="L5025"></li>
<li class="L5026" rel="L5026">She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.</li>
<li class="L5027" rel="L5027">“I did not think Caroline in spirits,” were her words, “but she was very</li>
<li class="L5028" rel="L5028">glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming</li>
<li class="L5029" rel="L5029">to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached</li>
<li class="L5030" rel="L5030">her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much</li>
<li class="L5031" rel="L5031">engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that</li>
<li class="L5032" rel="L5032">Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was</li>
<li class="L5033" rel="L5033">not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall</li>
<li class="L5034" rel="L5034">see them soon here.”</li>
<li class="L5035" rel="L5035"></li>
<li class="L5036" rel="L5036">Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that</li>
<li class="L5037" rel="L5037">accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister&#39;s being in town.</li>
<li class="L5038" rel="L5038"></li>
<li class="L5039" rel="L5039">Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to</li>
<li class="L5040" rel="L5040">persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be</li>
<li class="L5041" rel="L5041">blind to Miss Bingley&#39;s inattention. After waiting at home every morning</li>
<li class="L5042" rel="L5042">for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the</li>
<li class="L5043" rel="L5043">visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,</li>
<li class="L5044" rel="L5044">the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no</li>
<li class="L5045" rel="L5045">longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will</li>
<li class="L5046" rel="L5046">prove what she felt.</li>
<li class="L5047" rel="L5047"></li>
<li class="L5048" rel="L5048">“My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her</li>
<li class="L5049" rel="L5049">better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been</li>
<li class="L5050" rel="L5050">entirely deceived in Miss Bingley&#39;s regard for me. But, my dear sister,</li>
<li class="L5051" rel="L5051">though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I</li>
<li class="L5052" rel="L5052">still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was</li>
<li class="L5053" rel="L5053">as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for</li>
<li class="L5054" rel="L5054">wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to</li>
<li class="L5055" rel="L5055">happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not</li>
<li class="L5056" rel="L5056">return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I</li>
<li class="L5057" rel="L5057">receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that</li>
<li class="L5058" rel="L5058">she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not</li>
<li class="L5059" rel="L5059">calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was</li>
<li class="L5060" rel="L5060">in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was</li>
<li class="L5061" rel="L5061">perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity,</li>
<li class="L5062" rel="L5062">though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out</li>
<li class="L5063" rel="L5063">as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on</li>
<li class="L5064" rel="L5064">her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting</li>
<li class="L5065" rel="L5065">wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the</li>
<li class="L5066" rel="L5066">cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know</li>
<li class="L5067" rel="L5067">this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily</li>
<li class="L5068" rel="L5068">account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to</li>
<li class="L5069" rel="L5069">his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and</li>
<li class="L5070" rel="L5070">amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now,</li>
<li class="L5071" rel="L5071">because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.</li>
<li class="L5072" rel="L5072">He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said</li>
<li class="L5073" rel="L5073">herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she</li>
<li class="L5074" rel="L5074">wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I</li>
<li class="L5075" rel="L5075">cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should</li>
<li class="L5076" rel="L5076">be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity</li>
<li class="L5077" rel="L5077">in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought,</li>
<li class="L5078" rel="L5078">and think only of what will make me happy--your affection, and the</li>
<li class="L5079" rel="L5079">invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very</li>
<li class="L5080" rel="L5080">soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield</li>
<li class="L5081" rel="L5081">again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better</li>
<li class="L5082" rel="L5082">not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts</li>
<li class="L5083" rel="L5083">from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and</li>
<li class="L5084" rel="L5084">Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.--Yours, etc.”</li>
<li class="L5085" rel="L5085"></li>
<li class="L5086" rel="L5086">This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she</li>
<li class="L5087" rel="L5087">considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.</li>
<li class="L5088" rel="L5088">All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not</li>
<li class="L5089" rel="L5089">even wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on</li>
<li class="L5090" rel="L5090">every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible</li>
<li class="L5091" rel="L5091">advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.</li>
<li class="L5092" rel="L5092">Darcy&#39;s sister, as by Wickham&#39;s account, she would make him abundantly</li>
<li class="L5093" rel="L5093">regret what he had thrown away.</li>
<li class="L5094" rel="L5094"></li>
<li class="L5095" rel="L5095">Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise</li>
<li class="L5096" rel="L5096">concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth</li>
<li class="L5097" rel="L5097">had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to</li>
<li class="L5098" rel="L5098">herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,</li>
<li class="L5099" rel="L5099">he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to</li>
<li class="L5100" rel="L5100">see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.</li>
<li class="L5101" rel="L5101">Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied</li>
<li class="L5102" rel="L5102">with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune</li>
<li class="L5103" rel="L5103">permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most</li>
<li class="L5104" rel="L5104">remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself</li>
<li class="L5105" rel="L5105">agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than</li>
<li class="L5106" rel="L5106">in Charlotte&#39;s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.</li>
<li class="L5107" rel="L5107">Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to</li>
<li class="L5108" rel="L5108">suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was</li>
<li class="L5109" rel="L5109">ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very</li>
<li class="L5110" rel="L5110">sincerely wish him happy.</li>
<li class="L5111" rel="L5111"></li>
<li class="L5112" rel="L5112">All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the</li>
<li class="L5113" rel="L5113">circumstances, she thus went on: “I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that</li>
<li class="L5114" rel="L5114">I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure</li>
<li class="L5115" rel="L5115">and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and</li>
<li class="L5116" rel="L5116">wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial</li>
<li class="L5117" rel="L5117">towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find</li>
<li class="L5118" rel="L5118">out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to</li>
<li class="L5119" rel="L5119">think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My</li>
<li class="L5120" rel="L5120">watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more</li>
<li class="L5121" rel="L5121">interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love</li>
<li class="L5122" rel="L5122">with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.</li>
<li class="L5123" rel="L5123">Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take</li>
<li class="L5124" rel="L5124">his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the</li>
<li class="L5125" rel="L5125">ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that</li>
<li class="L5126" rel="L5126">handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.”</li>

<li class="L5130" rel="L5130">Chapter 27</li>
<li class="L5131" rel="L5131"></li>
<li class="L5132" rel="L5132"></li>
<li class="L5133" rel="L5133">With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise</li>
<li class="L5134" rel="L5134">diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and</li>
<li class="L5135" rel="L5135">sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take</li>
<li class="L5136" rel="L5136">Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of</li>
<li class="L5137" rel="L5137">going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan</li>
<li class="L5138" rel="L5138">and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure</li>
<li class="L5139" rel="L5139">as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing</li>
<li class="L5140" rel="L5140">Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There</li>
<li class="L5141" rel="L5141">was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such</li>
<li class="L5142" rel="L5142">uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change</li>
<li class="L5143" rel="L5143">was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her</li>
<li class="L5144" rel="L5144">a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have</li>
<li class="L5145" rel="L5145">been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,</li>
<li class="L5146" rel="L5146">and was finally settled according to Charlotte&#39;s first sketch. She was</li>
<li class="L5147" rel="L5147">to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement</li>
<li class="L5148" rel="L5148">of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became</li>
<li class="L5149" rel="L5149">perfect as plan could be.</li>
<li class="L5150" rel="L5150"></li>
<li class="L5151" rel="L5151">The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,</li>
<li class="L5152" rel="L5152">and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he</li>
<li class="L5153" rel="L5153">told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.</li>
<li class="L5154" rel="L5154"></li>
<li class="L5155" rel="L5155">The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on</li>
<li class="L5156" rel="L5156">his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that</li>
<li class="L5157" rel="L5157">Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the</li>
<li class="L5158" rel="L5158">first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner</li>
<li class="L5159" rel="L5159">of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of</li>
<li class="L5160" rel="L5160">what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their</li>
<li class="L5161" rel="L5161">opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there</li>
<li class="L5162" rel="L5162">was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to</li>
<li class="L5163" rel="L5163">him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that,</li>
<li class="L5164" rel="L5164">whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable</li>
<li class="L5165" rel="L5165">and pleasing.</li>
<li class="L5166" rel="L5166"></li>
<li class="L5167" rel="L5167">Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her</li>
<li class="L5168" rel="L5168">think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a</li>
<li class="L5169" rel="L5169">good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say</li>
<li class="L5170" rel="L5170">that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much</li>
<li class="L5171" rel="L5171">delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but</li>
<li class="L5172" rel="L5172">she had known Sir William&#39;s too long. He could tell her nothing new of</li>
<li class="L5173" rel="L5173">the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were</li>
<li class="L5174" rel="L5174">worn out, like his information.</li>
<li class="L5175" rel="L5175"></li>
<li class="L5176" rel="L5176">It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early</li>
<li class="L5177" rel="L5177">as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner&#39;s</li>
<li class="L5178" rel="L5178">door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when</li>
<li class="L5179" rel="L5179">they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,</li>
<li class="L5180" rel="L5180">looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and</li>
<li class="L5181" rel="L5181">lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,</li>
<li class="L5182" rel="L5182">whose eagerness for their cousin&#39;s appearance would not allow them to</li>
<li class="L5183" rel="L5183">wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen</li>
<li class="L5184" rel="L5184">her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and</li>
<li class="L5185" rel="L5185">kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and</li>
<li class="L5186" rel="L5186">shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.</li>
<li class="L5187" rel="L5187"></li>
<li class="L5188" rel="L5188">Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was her</li>
<li class="L5189" rel="L5189">sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to</li>
<li class="L5190" rel="L5190">her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her</li>
<li class="L5191" rel="L5191">spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however,</li>
<li class="L5192" rel="L5192">to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the</li>
<li class="L5193" rel="L5193">particulars also of Miss Bingley&#39;s visit in Gracechurch Street, and</li>
<li class="L5194" rel="L5194">repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and</li>
<li class="L5195" rel="L5195">herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the</li>
<li class="L5196" rel="L5196">acquaintance.</li>
<li class="L5197" rel="L5197"></li>
<li class="L5198" rel="L5198">Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham&#39;s desertion, and</li>
<li class="L5199" rel="L5199">complimented her on bearing it so well.</li>
<li class="L5200" rel="L5200"></li>
<li class="L5201" rel="L5201">“But my dear Elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is Miss King? I</li>
<li class="L5202" rel="L5202">should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”</li>
<li class="L5203" rel="L5203"></li>
<li class="L5204" rel="L5204">“Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,</li>
<li class="L5205" rel="L5205">between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,</li>
<li class="L5206" rel="L5206">and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,</li>
<li class="L5207" rel="L5207">because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get</li>
<li class="L5208" rel="L5208">a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is</li>
<li class="L5209" rel="L5209">mercenary.”</li>
<li class="L5210" rel="L5210"></li>
<li class="L5211" rel="L5211">“If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know</li>
<li class="L5212" rel="L5212">what to think.”</li>
<li class="L5213" rel="L5213"></li>
<li class="L5214" rel="L5214">“She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.”</li>
<li class="L5215" rel="L5215"></li>
<li class="L5216" rel="L5216">“But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather&#39;s death</li>
<li class="L5217" rel="L5217">made her mistress of this fortune.”</li>
<li class="L5218" rel="L5218"></li>
<li class="L5219" rel="L5219">“No--why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_</li>
<li class="L5220" rel="L5220">affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for</li>
<li class="L5221" rel="L5221">making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally</li>
<li class="L5222" rel="L5222">poor?”</li>
<li class="L5223" rel="L5223"></li>
<li class="L5224" rel="L5224">“But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her</li>
<li class="L5225" rel="L5225">so soon after this event.”</li>
<li class="L5226" rel="L5226"></li>
<li class="L5227" rel="L5227">“A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant</li>
<li class="L5228" rel="L5228">decorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,</li>
<li class="L5229" rel="L5229">why should _we_?”</li>
<li class="L5230" rel="L5230"></li>
<li class="L5231" rel="L5231">“_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her being</li>
<li class="L5232" rel="L5232">deficient in something herself--sense or feeling.”</li>
<li class="L5233" rel="L5233"></li>
<li class="L5234" rel="L5234">“Well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose. _He_ shall be</li>
<li class="L5235" rel="L5235">mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.”</li>
<li class="L5236" rel="L5236"></li>
<li class="L5237" rel="L5237">“No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,</li>
<li class="L5238" rel="L5238">to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.”</li>
<li class="L5239" rel="L5239"></li>
<li class="L5240" rel="L5240">“Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in</li>
<li class="L5241" rel="L5241">Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not</li>
<li class="L5242" rel="L5242">much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow</li>
<li class="L5243" rel="L5243">where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has</li>
<li class="L5244" rel="L5244">neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones</li>
<li class="L5245" rel="L5245">worth knowing, after all.”</li>
<li class="L5246" rel="L5246"></li>
<li class="L5247" rel="L5247">“Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.”</li>
<li class="L5248" rel="L5248"></li>
<li class="L5249" rel="L5249">Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the</li>
<li class="L5250" rel="L5250">unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in</li>
<li class="L5251" rel="L5251">a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.</li>
<li class="L5252" rel="L5252"></li>
<li class="L5253" rel="L5253">“We have not determined how far it shall carry us,” said Mrs. Gardiner,</li>
<li class="L5254" rel="L5254">“but, perhaps, to the Lakes.”</li>
<li class="L5255" rel="L5255"></li>
<li class="L5256" rel="L5256">No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her</li>
<li class="L5257" rel="L5257">acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. “Oh, my dear,</li>
<li class="L5258" rel="L5258">dear aunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what felicity! You</li>
<li class="L5259" rel="L5259">give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What</li>
<li class="L5260" rel="L5260">are young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport</li>
<li class="L5261" rel="L5261">we shall spend! And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other</li>
<li class="L5262" rel="L5262">travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We</li>
<li class="L5263" rel="L5263">_will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.</li>
<li class="L5264" rel="L5264">Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our</li>
<li class="L5265" rel="L5265">imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene,</li>
<li class="L5266" rel="L5266">will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let _our_</li>
<li class="L5267" rel="L5267">first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of</li>
<li class="L5268" rel="L5268">travellers.”</li>
<li class="L5269" rel="L5269"></li>
<li class="L5270" rel="L5270"></li>
<li class="L5271" rel="L5271"></li>
<li class="L5272" rel="L5272">Chapter 28</li>
<li class="L5273" rel="L5273"></li>
<li class="L5274" rel="L5274"></li>
<li class="L5275" rel="L5275">Every object in the next day&#39;s journey was new and interesting to</li>
<li class="L5276" rel="L5276">Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had</li>
<li class="L5277" rel="L5277">seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,</li>
<li class="L5278" rel="L5278">and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.</li>
<li class="L5279" rel="L5279"></li>
<li class="L5280" rel="L5280">When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in</li>
<li class="L5281" rel="L5281">search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.</li>
<li class="L5282" rel="L5282">The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth</li>
<li class="L5283" rel="L5283">smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.</li>
<li class="L5284" rel="L5284"></li>
<li class="L5285" rel="L5285">At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the</li>
<li class="L5286" rel="L5286">road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,</li>
<li class="L5287" rel="L5287">everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte</li>
<li class="L5288" rel="L5288">appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which</li>
<li class="L5289" rel="L5289">led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of</li>
<li class="L5290" rel="L5290">the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing</li>
<li class="L5291" rel="L5291">at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the</li>
<li class="L5292" rel="L5292">liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with</li>
<li class="L5293" rel="L5293">coming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw</li>
<li class="L5294" rel="L5294">instantly that her cousin&#39;s manners were not altered by his marriage;</li>
<li class="L5295" rel="L5295">his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some</li>
<li class="L5296" rel="L5296">minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her</li>
<li class="L5297" rel="L5297">family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the</li>
<li class="L5298" rel="L5298">neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they</li>
<li class="L5299" rel="L5299">were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious</li>
<li class="L5300" rel="L5300">formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife&#39;s</li>
<li class="L5301" rel="L5301">offers of refreshment.</li>
<li class="L5302" rel="L5302"></li>
<li class="L5303" rel="L5303">Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help</li>
<li class="L5304" rel="L5304">in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its</li>
<li class="L5305" rel="L5305">aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her,</li>
<li class="L5306" rel="L5306">as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But</li>
<li class="L5307" rel="L5307">though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to</li>
<li class="L5308" rel="L5308">gratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at</li>
<li class="L5309" rel="L5309">her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.</li>
<li class="L5310" rel="L5310">When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be</li>
<li class="L5311" rel="L5311">ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her</li>
<li class="L5312" rel="L5312">eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but</li>
<li class="L5313" rel="L5313">in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to</li>
<li class="L5314" rel="L5314">admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to</li>
<li class="L5315" rel="L5315">the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had</li>
<li class="L5316" rel="L5316">happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the</li>
<li class="L5317" rel="L5317">garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of</li>
<li class="L5318" rel="L5318">which he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most</li>
<li class="L5319" rel="L5319">respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance</li>
<li class="L5320" rel="L5320">with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and</li>
<li class="L5321" rel="L5321">owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way</li>
<li class="L5322" rel="L5322">through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an</li>
<li class="L5323" rel="L5323">interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out</li>
<li class="L5324" rel="L5324">with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the</li>
<li class="L5325" rel="L5325">fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in</li>
<li class="L5326" rel="L5326">the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which</li>
<li class="L5327" rel="L5327">the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the</li>
<li class="L5328" rel="L5328">prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered</li>
<li class="L5329" rel="L5329">the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome</li>
<li class="L5330" rel="L5330">modern building, well situated on rising ground.</li>
<li class="L5331" rel="L5331"></li>
<li class="L5332" rel="L5332">From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;</li>
<li class="L5333" rel="L5333">but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white</li>
<li class="L5334" rel="L5334">frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte</li>
<li class="L5335" rel="L5335">took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,</li>
<li class="L5336" rel="L5336">probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband&#39;s</li>
<li class="L5337" rel="L5337">help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything</li>
<li class="L5338" rel="L5338">was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which</li>
<li class="L5339" rel="L5339">Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be</li>
<li class="L5340" rel="L5340">forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by</li>
<li class="L5341" rel="L5341">Charlotte&#39;s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often</li>
<li class="L5342" rel="L5342">forgotten.</li>
<li class="L5343" rel="L5343"></li>
<li class="L5344" rel="L5344">She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It</li>
<li class="L5345" rel="L5345">was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining</li>
<li class="L5346" rel="L5346">in, observed:</li>
<li class="L5347" rel="L5347"></li>
<li class="L5348" rel="L5348">“Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine</li>
<li class="L5349" rel="L5349">de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will</li>
<li class="L5350" rel="L5350">be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I</li>
<li class="L5351" rel="L5351">doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice</li>
<li class="L5352" rel="L5352">when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she</li>
<li class="L5353" rel="L5353">will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she</li>
<li class="L5354" rel="L5354">honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is</li>
<li class="L5355" rel="L5355">charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed</li>
<li class="L5356" rel="L5356">to walk home. Her ladyship&#39;s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I</li>
<li class="L5357" rel="L5357">_should_ say, one of her ladyship&#39;s carriages, for she has several.”</li>
<li class="L5358" rel="L5358"></li>
<li class="L5359" rel="L5359">“Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,” added</li>
<li class="L5360" rel="L5360">Charlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”</li>
<li class="L5361" rel="L5361"></li>
<li class="L5362" rel="L5362">“Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of</li>
<li class="L5363" rel="L5363">woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”</li>
<li class="L5364" rel="L5364"></li>
<li class="L5365" rel="L5365">The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,</li>
<li class="L5366" rel="L5366">and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed,</li>
<li class="L5367" rel="L5367">Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon</li>
<li class="L5368" rel="L5368">Charlotte&#39;s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,</li>
<li class="L5369" rel="L5369">and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it</li>
<li class="L5370" rel="L5370">was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit</li>
<li class="L5371" rel="L5371">would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious</li>
<li class="L5372" rel="L5372">interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with</li>
<li class="L5373" rel="L5373">Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.</li>
<li class="L5374" rel="L5374"></li>
<li class="L5375" rel="L5375">About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready</li>
<li class="L5376" rel="L5376">for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in</li>
<li class="L5377" rel="L5377">confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running</li>
<li class="L5378" rel="L5378">up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened</li>
<li class="L5379" rel="L5379">the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with</li>
<li class="L5380" rel="L5380">agitation, cried out--</li>
<li class="L5381" rel="L5381"></li>
<li class="L5382" rel="L5382">“Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for</li>
<li class="L5383" rel="L5383">there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make</li>
<li class="L5384" rel="L5384">haste, and come down this moment.”</li>
<li class="L5385" rel="L5385"></li>
<li class="L5386" rel="L5386">Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,</li>
<li class="L5387" rel="L5387">and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in</li>
<li class="L5388" rel="L5388">quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the</li>
<li class="L5389" rel="L5389">garden gate.</li>
<li class="L5390" rel="L5390"></li>
<li class="L5391" rel="L5391">“And is this all?” cried Elizabeth. “I expected at least that the pigs</li>
<li class="L5392" rel="L5392">were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her</li>
<li class="L5393" rel="L5393">daughter.”</li>
<li class="L5394" rel="L5394"></li>
<li class="L5395" rel="L5395">“La! my dear,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not</li>
<li class="L5396" rel="L5396">Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them;</li>
<li class="L5397" rel="L5397">the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little</li>
<li class="L5398" rel="L5398">creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?”</li>
<li class="L5399" rel="L5399"></li>
<li class="L5400" rel="L5400">“She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.</li>
<li class="L5401" rel="L5401">Why does she not come in?”</li>
<li class="L5402" rel="L5402"></li>
<li class="L5403" rel="L5403">“Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours</li>
<li class="L5404" rel="L5404">when Miss de Bourgh comes in.”</li>
<li class="L5405" rel="L5405"></li>
<li class="L5406" rel="L5406">“I like her appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. “She</li>
<li class="L5407" rel="L5407">looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will</li>
<li class="L5408" rel="L5408">make him a very proper wife.”</li>
<li class="L5409" rel="L5409"></li>
<li class="L5410" rel="L5410">Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation</li>
<li class="L5411" rel="L5411">with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth&#39;s high diversion, was</li>
<li class="L5412" rel="L5412">stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness</li>
<li class="L5413" rel="L5413">before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that</li>
<li class="L5414" rel="L5414">way.</li>
<li class="L5415" rel="L5415"></li>
<li class="L5416" rel="L5416">At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and</li>
<li class="L5417" rel="L5417">the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two</li>
<li class="L5418" rel="L5418">girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which</li>
<li class="L5419" rel="L5419">Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked</li>
<li class="L5420" rel="L5420">to dine at Rosings the next day.</li>
<li class="L5421" rel="L5421"></li>
<li class="L5422" rel="L5422"></li>
<li class="L5423" rel="L5423"></li>
<li class="L5424" rel="L5424">Chapter 29</li>
<li class="L5425" rel="L5425"></li>
<li class="L5426" rel="L5426"></li>
<li class="L5427" rel="L5427">Mr. Collins&#39;s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.</li>
<li class="L5428" rel="L5428">The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering</li>
<li class="L5429" rel="L5429">visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his</li>
<li class="L5430" rel="L5430">wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity</li>
<li class="L5431" rel="L5431">of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady</li>
<li class="L5432" rel="L5432">Catherine&#39;s condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.</li>
<li class="L5433" rel="L5433"></li>
<li class="L5434" rel="L5434">“I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised by</li>
<li class="L5435" rel="L5435">her ladyship&#39;s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at</li>
<li class="L5436" rel="L5436">Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it</li>
<li class="L5437" rel="L5437">would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who</li>
<li class="L5438" rel="L5438">could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there</li>
<li class="L5439" rel="L5439">(an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately</li>
<li class="L5440" rel="L5440">after your arrival!”</li>
<li class="L5441" rel="L5441"></li>
<li class="L5442" rel="L5442">“I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William,</li>
<li class="L5443" rel="L5443">“from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which</li>
<li class="L5444" rel="L5444">my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such</li>
<li class="L5445" rel="L5445">instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”</li>
<li class="L5446" rel="L5446"></li>
<li class="L5447" rel="L5447">Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their</li>
<li class="L5448" rel="L5448">visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what</li>
<li class="L5449" rel="L5449">they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and</li>
<li class="L5450" rel="L5450">so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.</li>
<li class="L5451" rel="L5451"></li>
<li class="L5452" rel="L5452">When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth--</li>
<li class="L5453" rel="L5453"></li>
<li class="L5454" rel="L5454">“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady</li>
<li class="L5455" rel="L5455">Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which</li>
<li class="L5456" rel="L5456">becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on</li>
<li class="L5457" rel="L5457">whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion</li>
<li class="L5458" rel="L5458">for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you</li>
<li class="L5459" rel="L5459">for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank</li>
<li class="L5460" rel="L5460">preserved.”</li>
<li class="L5461" rel="L5461"></li>
<li class="L5462" rel="L5462">While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different</li>
<li class="L5463" rel="L5463">doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much</li>
<li class="L5464" rel="L5464">objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of</li>
<li class="L5465" rel="L5465">her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas</li>
<li class="L5466" rel="L5466">who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her</li>
<li class="L5467" rel="L5467">introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done</li>
<li class="L5468" rel="L5468">to his presentation at St. James&#39;s.</li>
<li class="L5469" rel="L5469"></li>
<li class="L5470" rel="L5470">As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a</li>
<li class="L5471" rel="L5471">mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and</li>
<li class="L5472" rel="L5472">Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such</li>
<li class="L5473" rel="L5473">raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but</li>
<li class="L5474" rel="L5474">slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the</li>
<li class="L5475" rel="L5475">house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally</li>
<li class="L5476" rel="L5476">cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.</li>
<li class="L5477" rel="L5477"></li>
<li class="L5478" rel="L5478">When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria&#39;s alarm was every</li>
<li class="L5479" rel="L5479">moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.</li>
<li class="L5480" rel="L5480">Elizabeth&#39;s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady</li>
<li class="L5481" rel="L5481">Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or</li>
<li class="L5482" rel="L5482">miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought</li>
<li class="L5483" rel="L5483">she could witness without trepidation.</li>
<li class="L5484" rel="L5484"></li>
<li class="L5485" rel="L5485">From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a</li>
<li class="L5486" rel="L5486">rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they</li>
<li class="L5487" rel="L5487">followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady</li>
<li class="L5488" rel="L5488">Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship,</li>
<li class="L5489" rel="L5489">with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had</li>
<li class="L5490" rel="L5490">settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should</li>
<li class="L5491" rel="L5491">be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those</li>
<li class="L5492" rel="L5492">apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.</li>
<li class="L5493" rel="L5493"></li>
<li class="L5494" rel="L5494">In spite of having been at St. James&#39;s, Sir William was so completely</li>
<li class="L5495" rel="L5495">awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage</li>
<li class="L5496" rel="L5496">enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;</li>
<li class="L5497" rel="L5497">and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge</li>
<li class="L5498" rel="L5498">of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself</li>
<li class="L5499" rel="L5499">quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her</li>
<li class="L5500" rel="L5500">composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked</li>
<li class="L5501" rel="L5501">features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not</li>
<li class="L5502" rel="L5502">conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her</li>
<li class="L5503" rel="L5503">visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by</li>
<li class="L5504" rel="L5504">silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone,</li>
<li class="L5505" rel="L5505">as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to</li>
<li class="L5506" rel="L5506">Elizabeth&#39;s mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she</li>
<li class="L5507" rel="L5507">believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.</li>
<li class="L5508" rel="L5508"></li>
<li class="L5509" rel="L5509">When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment</li>
<li class="L5510" rel="L5510">she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the</li>
<li class="L5511" rel="L5511">daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria&#39;s astonishment at her</li>
<li class="L5512" rel="L5512">being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any</li>
<li class="L5513" rel="L5513">likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her</li>
<li class="L5514" rel="L5514">features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very</li>
<li class="L5515" rel="L5515">little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance</li>
<li class="L5516" rel="L5516">there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening</li>
<li class="L5517" rel="L5517">to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before</li>
<li class="L5518" rel="L5518">her eyes.</li>
<li class="L5519" rel="L5519"></li>
<li class="L5520" rel="L5520">After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to</li>
<li class="L5521" rel="L5521">admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,</li>
<li class="L5522" rel="L5522">and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth</li>
<li class="L5523" rel="L5523">looking at in the summer.</li>
<li class="L5524" rel="L5524"></li>
<li class="L5525" rel="L5525">The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and</li>
<li class="L5526" rel="L5526">all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had</li>
<li class="L5527" rel="L5527">likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her</li>
<li class="L5528" rel="L5528">ladyship&#39;s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish</li>
<li class="L5529" rel="L5529">nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted</li>
<li class="L5530" rel="L5530">alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir</li>
<li class="L5531" rel="L5531">William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law</li>
<li class="L5532" rel="L5532">said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.</li>
<li class="L5533" rel="L5533">But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and</li>
<li class="L5534" rel="L5534">gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved</li>
<li class="L5535" rel="L5535">a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth</li>
<li class="L5536" rel="L5536">was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated</li>
<li class="L5537" rel="L5537">between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in</li>
<li class="L5538" rel="L5538">listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all</li>
<li class="L5539" rel="L5539">dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little</li>
<li class="L5540" rel="L5540">Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing</li>
<li class="L5541" rel="L5541">she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the</li>
<li class="L5542" rel="L5542">gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.</li>
<li class="L5543" rel="L5543"></li>
<li class="L5544" rel="L5544">When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to</li>
<li class="L5545" rel="L5545">be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any</li>
<li class="L5546" rel="L5546">intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every</li>
<li class="L5547" rel="L5547">subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to</li>
<li class="L5548" rel="L5548">have her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte&#39;s domestic</li>
<li class="L5549" rel="L5549">concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as</li>
<li class="L5550" rel="L5550">to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be</li>
<li class="L5551" rel="L5551">regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the</li>
<li class="L5552" rel="L5552">care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was</li>
<li class="L5553" rel="L5553">beneath this great lady&#39;s attention, which could furnish her with an</li>
<li class="L5554" rel="L5554">occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse</li>
<li class="L5555" rel="L5555">with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and</li>
<li class="L5556" rel="L5556">Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew</li>
<li class="L5557" rel="L5557">the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel,</li>
<li class="L5558" rel="L5558">pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters</li>
<li class="L5559" rel="L5559">she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of</li>
<li class="L5560" rel="L5560">them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they</li>
<li class="L5561" rel="L5561">had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been</li>
<li class="L5562" rel="L5562">her mother&#39;s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of</li>
<li class="L5563" rel="L5563">her questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then</li>
<li class="L5564" rel="L5564">observed,</li>
<li class="L5565" rel="L5565"></li>
<li class="L5566" rel="L5566">“Your father&#39;s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your</li>
<li class="L5567" rel="L5567">sake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no</li>
<li class="L5568" rel="L5568">occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought</li>
<li class="L5569" rel="L5569">necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh&#39;s family. Do you play and sing, Miss</li>
<li class="L5570" rel="L5570">Bennet?”</li>
<li class="L5571" rel="L5571"></li>
<li class="L5572" rel="L5572">“A little.”</li>
<li class="L5573" rel="L5573"></li>
<li class="L5574" rel="L5574">“Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our</li>
<li class="L5575" rel="L5575">instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it</li>
<li class="L5576" rel="L5576">some day. Do your sisters play and sing?”</li>
<li class="L5577" rel="L5577"></li>
<li class="L5578" rel="L5578">“One of them does.”</li>
<li class="L5579" rel="L5579"></li>
<li class="L5580" rel="L5580">“Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss</li>
<li class="L5581" rel="L5581">Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do</li>
<li class="L5582" rel="L5582">you draw?”</li>
<li class="L5583" rel="L5583"></li>
<li class="L5584" rel="L5584">“No, not at all.”</li>
<li class="L5585" rel="L5585"></li>
<li class="L5586" rel="L5586">“What, none of you?”</li>
<li class="L5587" rel="L5587"></li>
<li class="L5588" rel="L5588">“Not one.”</li>
<li class="L5589" rel="L5589"></li>
<li class="L5590" rel="L5590">“That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother</li>
<li class="L5591" rel="L5591">should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”</li>
<li class="L5592" rel="L5592"></li>
<li class="L5593" rel="L5593">“My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.”</li>
<li class="L5594" rel="L5594"></li>
<li class="L5595" rel="L5595">“Has your governess left you?”</li>
<li class="L5596" rel="L5596"></li>
<li class="L5597" rel="L5597">“We never had any governess.”</li>
<li class="L5598" rel="L5598"></li>
<li class="L5599" rel="L5599">“No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home</li>
<li class="L5600" rel="L5600">without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must</li>
<li class="L5601" rel="L5601">have been quite a slave to your education.”</li>
<li class="L5602" rel="L5602"></li>
<li class="L5603" rel="L5603">Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been</li>
<li class="L5604" rel="L5604">the case.</li>
<li class="L5605" rel="L5605"></li>
<li class="L5606" rel="L5606">“Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you</li>
<li class="L5607" rel="L5607">must have been neglected.”</li>
<li class="L5608" rel="L5608"></li>
<li class="L5609" rel="L5609">“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as</li>
<li class="L5610" rel="L5610">wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to</li>
<li class="L5611" rel="L5611">read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be</li>
<li class="L5612" rel="L5612">idle, certainly might.”</li>
<li class="L5613" rel="L5613"></li>
<li class="L5614" rel="L5614">“Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had</li>
<li class="L5615" rel="L5615">known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage</li>
<li class="L5616" rel="L5616">one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady</li>
<li class="L5617" rel="L5617">and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is</li>
<li class="L5618" rel="L5618">wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that</li>
<li class="L5619" rel="L5619">way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces</li>
<li class="L5620" rel="L5620">of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and</li>
<li class="L5621" rel="L5621">it was but the other day that I recommended another young person,</li>
<li class="L5622" rel="L5622">who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite</li>
<li class="L5623" rel="L5623">delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf&#39;s</li>
<li class="L5624" rel="L5624">calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. &#39;Lady</li>
<li class="L5625" rel="L5625">Catherine,&#39; said she, &#39;you have given me a treasure.&#39; Are any of your</li>
<li class="L5626" rel="L5626">younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”</li>
<li class="L5627" rel="L5627"></li>
<li class="L5628" rel="L5628">“Yes, ma&#39;am, all.”</li>
<li class="L5629" rel="L5629"></li>
<li class="L5630" rel="L5630">“All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The</li>
<li class="L5631" rel="L5631">younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters</li>
<li class="L5632" rel="L5632">must be very young?”</li>
<li class="L5633" rel="L5633"></li>
<li class="L5634" rel="L5634">“Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be</li>
<li class="L5635" rel="L5635">much in company. But really, ma&#39;am, I think it would be very hard upon</li>
<li class="L5636" rel="L5636">younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and</li>
<li class="L5637" rel="L5637">amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to</li>
<li class="L5638" rel="L5638">marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth</li>
<li class="L5639" rel="L5639">as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would</li>
<li class="L5640" rel="L5640">not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”</li>
<li class="L5641" rel="L5641"></li>
<li class="L5642" rel="L5642">“Upon my word,” said her ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly</li>
<li class="L5643" rel="L5643">for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”</li>
<li class="L5644" rel="L5644"></li>
<li class="L5645" rel="L5645">“With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your</li>
<li class="L5646" rel="L5646">ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.”</li>
<li class="L5647" rel="L5647"></li>
<li class="L5648" rel="L5648">Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;</li>
<li class="L5649" rel="L5649">and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever</li>
<li class="L5650" rel="L5650">dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.</li>
<li class="L5651" rel="L5651"></li>
<li class="L5652" rel="L5652">“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not</li>
<li class="L5653" rel="L5653">conceal your age.”</li>
<li class="L5654" rel="L5654"></li>
<li class="L5655" rel="L5655">“I am not one-and-twenty.”</li>
<li class="L5656" rel="L5656"></li>
<li class="L5657" rel="L5657">When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables</li>
<li class="L5658" rel="L5658">were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat</li>
<li class="L5659" rel="L5659">down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the</li>
<li class="L5660" rel="L5660">two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her</li>
<li class="L5661" rel="L5661">party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was</li>
<li class="L5662" rel="L5662">uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson</li>
<li class="L5663" rel="L5663">expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh&#39;s being too hot or too cold, or</li>
<li class="L5664" rel="L5664">having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the</li>
<li class="L5665" rel="L5665">other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes</li>
<li class="L5666" rel="L5666">of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins</li>
<li class="L5667" rel="L5667">was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her</li>
<li class="L5668" rel="L5668">for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.</li>
<li class="L5669" rel="L5669">Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes</li>
<li class="L5670" rel="L5670">and noble names.</li>
<li class="L5671" rel="L5671"></li>
<li class="L5672" rel="L5672">When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,</li>
<li class="L5673" rel="L5673">the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,</li>
<li class="L5674" rel="L5674">gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered</li>
<li class="L5675" rel="L5675">round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were</li>
<li class="L5676" rel="L5676">to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by</li>
<li class="L5677" rel="L5677">the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.</li>
<li class="L5678" rel="L5678">Collins&#39;s side and as many bows on Sir William&#39;s they departed. As soon</li>
<li class="L5679" rel="L5679">as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin</li>
<li class="L5680" rel="L5680">to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for</li>
<li class="L5681" rel="L5681">Charlotte&#39;s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her</li>
<li class="L5682" rel="L5682">commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy</li>
<li class="L5683" rel="L5683">Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship&#39;s praise</li>
<li class="L5684" rel="L5684">into his own hands.</li>
<li class="L5685" rel="L5685"></li>
<li class="L5686" rel="L5686"></li>
<li class="L5687" rel="L5687"></li>
<li class="L5688" rel="L5688">Chapter 30</li>
<li class="L5689" rel="L5689"></li>
<li class="L5690" rel="L5690"></li>
<li class="L5691" rel="L5691">Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long</li>
<li class="L5692" rel="L5692">enough to convince him of his daughter&#39;s being most comfortably settled,</li>
<li class="L5693" rel="L5693">and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not</li>
<li class="L5694" rel="L5694">often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his</li>
<li class="L5695" rel="L5695">morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but</li>
<li class="L5696" rel="L5696">when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,</li>
<li class="L5697" rel="L5697">and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her</li>
<li class="L5698" rel="L5698">cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast</li>
<li class="L5699" rel="L5699">and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in</li>
<li class="L5700" rel="L5700">reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room,</li>
<li class="L5701" rel="L5701">which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.</li>
<li class="L5702" rel="L5702">Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer</li>
<li class="L5703" rel="L5703">the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a</li>
<li class="L5704" rel="L5704">more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent</li>
<li class="L5705" rel="L5705">reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been</li>
<li class="L5706" rel="L5706">much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and</li>
<li class="L5707" rel="L5707">she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.</li>
<li class="L5708" rel="L5708"></li>
<li class="L5709" rel="L5709">From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and</li>
<li class="L5710" rel="L5710">were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went</li>
<li class="L5711" rel="L5711">along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,</li>
<li class="L5712" rel="L5712">which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened</li>
<li class="L5713" rel="L5713">almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and</li>
<li class="L5714" rel="L5714">had a few minutes&#39; conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever</li>
<li class="L5715" rel="L5715">prevailed upon to get out.</li>
<li class="L5716" rel="L5716"></li>
<li class="L5717" rel="L5717">Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and</li>
<li class="L5718" rel="L5718">not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;</li>
<li class="L5719" rel="L5719">and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings</li>
<li class="L5720" rel="L5720">to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many</li>
<li class="L5721" rel="L5721">hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,</li>
<li class="L5722" rel="L5722">and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during</li>
<li class="L5723" rel="L5723">these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,</li>
<li class="L5724" rel="L5724">and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement</li>
<li class="L5725" rel="L5725">of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she</li>
<li class="L5726" rel="L5726">accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding</li>
<li class="L5727" rel="L5727">out that Mrs. Collins&#39;s joints of meat were too large for her family.</li>
<li class="L5728" rel="L5728"></li>
<li class="L5729" rel="L5729">Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in</li>
<li class="L5730" rel="L5730">commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate</li>
<li class="L5731" rel="L5731">in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her</li>
<li class="L5732" rel="L5732">by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to</li>
<li class="L5733" rel="L5733">be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the</li>
<li class="L5734" rel="L5734">village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold</li>
<li class="L5735" rel="L5735">them into harmony and plenty.</li>
<li class="L5736" rel="L5736"></li>
<li class="L5737" rel="L5737">The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;</li>
<li class="L5738" rel="L5738">and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one</li>
<li class="L5739" rel="L5739">card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart</li>
<li class="L5740" rel="L5740">of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living</li>
<li class="L5741" rel="L5741">in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins&#39;s reach. This,</li>
<li class="L5742" rel="L5742">however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time</li>
<li class="L5743" rel="L5743">comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with</li>
<li class="L5744" rel="L5744">Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had</li>
<li class="L5745" rel="L5745">often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she</li>
<li class="L5746" rel="L5746">frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was</li>
<li class="L5747" rel="L5747">along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was</li>
<li class="L5748" rel="L5748">a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and</li>
<li class="L5749" rel="L5749">where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine&#39;s curiosity.</li>
<li class="L5750" rel="L5750"></li>
<li class="L5751" rel="L5751">In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.</li>
<li class="L5752" rel="L5752">Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an</li>
<li class="L5753" rel="L5753">addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be</li>
<li class="L5754" rel="L5754">important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was</li>
<li class="L5755" rel="L5755">expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not</li>
<li class="L5756" rel="L5756">many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would</li>
<li class="L5757" rel="L5757">furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and</li>
<li class="L5758" rel="L5758">she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley&#39;s designs on him</li>
<li class="L5759" rel="L5759">were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently</li>
<li class="L5760" rel="L5760">destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest</li>
<li class="L5761" rel="L5761">satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and</li>
<li class="L5762" rel="L5762">seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by</li>
<li class="L5763" rel="L5763">Miss Lucas and herself.</li>
<li class="L5764" rel="L5764"></li>
<li class="L5765" rel="L5765">His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking</li>
<li class="L5766" rel="L5766">the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,</li>
<li class="L5767" rel="L5767">in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his</li>
<li class="L5768" rel="L5768">bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great</li>
<li class="L5769" rel="L5769">intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his</li>
<li class="L5770" rel="L5770">respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for</li>
<li class="L5771" rel="L5771">Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of</li>
<li class="L5772" rel="L5772">his uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when</li>
<li class="L5773" rel="L5773">Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen</li>
<li class="L5774" rel="L5774">them from her husband&#39;s room, crossing the road, and immediately running</li>
<li class="L5775" rel="L5775">into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:</li>
<li class="L5776" rel="L5776"></li>
<li class="L5777" rel="L5777">“I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would</li>
<li class="L5778" rel="L5778">never have come so soon to wait upon me.”</li>
<li class="L5779" rel="L5779"></li>
<li class="L5780" rel="L5780">Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,</li>
<li class="L5781" rel="L5781">before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly</li>
<li class="L5782" rel="L5782">afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,</li>
<li class="L5783" rel="L5783">who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and</li>
<li class="L5784" rel="L5784">address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been</li>
<li class="L5785" rel="L5785">used to look in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual</li>
<li class="L5786" rel="L5786">reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her</li>
<li class="L5787" rel="L5787">friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely</li>
<li class="L5788" rel="L5788">curtseyed to him without saying a word.</li>
<li class="L5789" rel="L5789"></li>
<li class="L5790" rel="L5790">Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the</li>
<li class="L5791" rel="L5791">readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but</li>
<li class="L5792" rel="L5792">his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and</li>
<li class="L5793" rel="L5793">garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.</li>
<li class="L5794" rel="L5794">At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of</li>
<li class="L5795" rel="L5795">Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual</li>
<li class="L5796" rel="L5796">way, and after a moment&#39;s pause, added:</li>
<li class="L5797" rel="L5797"></li>
<li class="L5798" rel="L5798">“My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never</li>
<li class="L5799" rel="L5799">happened to see her there?”</li>
<li class="L5800" rel="L5800"></li>
<li class="L5801" rel="L5801">She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see</li>
<li class="L5802" rel="L5802">whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between</li>
<li class="L5803" rel="L5803">the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he</li>
<li class="L5804" rel="L5804">answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The</li>
<li class="L5805" rel="L5805">subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went</li>
<li class="L5806" rel="L5806">away.</li>
<li class="L5807" rel="L5807"></li>
<li class="L5808" rel="L5808"></li>

<li class="L5811" rel="L5811"></li>
<li class="L5812" rel="L5812"></li>
<li class="L5813" rel="L5813">Colonel Fitzwilliam&#39;s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,</li>
<li class="L5814" rel="L5814">and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures</li>
<li class="L5815" rel="L5815">of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they</li>
<li class="L5816" rel="L5816">received any invitation thither--for while there were visitors in the</li>
<li class="L5817" rel="L5817">house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,</li>
<li class="L5818" rel="L5818">almost a week after the gentlemen&#39;s arrival, that they were honoured by</li>
<li class="L5819" rel="L5819">such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to</li>
<li class="L5820" rel="L5820">come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little</li>
<li class="L5821" rel="L5821">of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the</li>
<li class="L5822" rel="L5822">Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen</li>
<li class="L5823" rel="L5823">only at church.</li>
<li class="L5824" rel="L5824"></li>
<li class="L5825" rel="L5825">The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined</li>
<li class="L5826" rel="L5826">the party in Lady Catherine&#39;s drawing-room. Her ladyship received</li>
<li class="L5827" rel="L5827">them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so</li>
<li class="L5828" rel="L5828">acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,</li>
<li class="L5829" rel="L5829">almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,</li>
<li class="L5830" rel="L5830">much more than to any other person in the room.</li>
<li class="L5831" rel="L5831"></li>
<li class="L5832" rel="L5832">Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a</li>
<li class="L5833" rel="L5833">welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins&#39;s pretty friend had</li>
<li class="L5834" rel="L5834">moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and</li>
<li class="L5835" rel="L5835">talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying</li>
<li class="L5836" rel="L5836">at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so</li>
<li class="L5837" rel="L5837">well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much</li>
<li class="L5838" rel="L5838">spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself,</li>
<li class="L5839" rel="L5839">as well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned</li>
<li class="L5840" rel="L5840">towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a</li>
<li class="L5841" rel="L5841">while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not</li>
<li class="L5842" rel="L5842">scruple to call out:</li>
<li class="L5843" rel="L5843"></li>
<li class="L5844" rel="L5844">“What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking</li>
<li class="L5845" rel="L5845">of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.”</li>
<li class="L5846" rel="L5846"></li>
<li class="L5847" rel="L5847">“We are speaking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able to avoid</li>
<li class="L5848" rel="L5848">a reply.</li>
<li class="L5849" rel="L5849"></li>
<li class="L5850" rel="L5850">“Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I</li>
<li class="L5851" rel="L5851">must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music.</li>
<li class="L5852" rel="L5852">There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment</li>
<li class="L5853" rel="L5853">of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt,</li>
<li class="L5854" rel="L5854">I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health</li>
<li class="L5855" rel="L5855">had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed</li>
<li class="L5856" rel="L5856">delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?”</li>
<li class="L5857" rel="L5857"></li>
<li class="L5858" rel="L5858">Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister&#39;s proficiency.</li>
<li class="L5859" rel="L5859"></li>
<li class="L5860" rel="L5860">“I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said Lady</li>
<li class="L5861" rel="L5861">Catherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel</li>
<li class="L5862" rel="L5862">if she does not practice a good deal.”</li>
<li class="L5863" rel="L5863"></li>
<li class="L5864" rel="L5864">“I assure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need such advice.</li>
<li class="L5865" rel="L5865">She practises very constantly.”</li>
<li class="L5866" rel="L5866"></li>
<li class="L5867" rel="L5867">“So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write</li>
<li class="L5868" rel="L5868">to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often</li>
<li class="L5869" rel="L5869">tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without</li>
<li class="L5870" rel="L5870">constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she</li>
<li class="L5871" rel="L5871">will never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs.</li>
<li class="L5872" rel="L5872">Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told</li>
<li class="L5873" rel="L5873">her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.</li>
<li class="L5874" rel="L5874">Jenkinson&#39;s room. She would be in nobody&#39;s way, you know, in that part</li>
<li class="L5875" rel="L5875">of the house.”</li>
<li class="L5876" rel="L5876"></li>
<li class="L5877" rel="L5877">Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt&#39;s ill-breeding, and made</li>
<li class="L5878" rel="L5878">no answer.</li>
<li class="L5879" rel="L5879"></li>
<li class="L5880" rel="L5880">When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having</li>
<li class="L5881" rel="L5881">promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He</li>
<li class="L5882" rel="L5882">drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then</li>
<li class="L5883" rel="L5883">talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away</li>
<li class="L5884" rel="L5884">from her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte</li>
<li class="L5885" rel="L5885">stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer&#39;s</li>
<li class="L5886" rel="L5886">countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first</li>
<li class="L5887" rel="L5887">convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:</li>
<li class="L5888" rel="L5888"></li>
<li class="L5889" rel="L5889">“You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear</li>
<li class="L5890" rel="L5890">me? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well. There</li>
<li class="L5891" rel="L5891">is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the</li>
<li class="L5892" rel="L5892">will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate</li>
<li class="L5893" rel="L5893">me.”</li>
<li class="L5894" rel="L5894"></li>
<li class="L5895" rel="L5895">“I shall not say you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you could not</li>
<li class="L5896" rel="L5896">really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have</li>
<li class="L5897" rel="L5897">had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find</li>
<li class="L5898" rel="L5898">great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are</li>
<li class="L5899" rel="L5899">not your own.”</li>
<li class="L5900" rel="L5900"></li>
<li class="L5901" rel="L5901">Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to</li>
<li class="L5902" rel="L5902">Colonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of</li>
<li class="L5903" rel="L5903">me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky</li>
<li class="L5904" rel="L5904">in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part</li>
<li class="L5905" rel="L5905">of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of</li>
<li class="L5906" rel="L5906">credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all</li>
<li class="L5907" rel="L5907">that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to</li>
<li class="L5908" rel="L5908">say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such</li>
<li class="L5909" rel="L5909">things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”</li>
<li class="L5910" rel="L5910"></li>
<li class="L5911" rel="L5911">“I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.</li>
<li class="L5912" rel="L5912"></li>
<li class="L5913" rel="L5913">“Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried Colonel</li>
<li class="L5914" rel="L5914">Fitzwilliam. “I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.”</li>
<li class="L5915" rel="L5915"></li>
<li class="L5916" rel="L5916">“You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.</li>
<li class="L5917" rel="L5917">The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,</li>
<li class="L5918" rel="L5918">was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced</li>
<li class="L5919" rel="L5919">only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain</li>
<li class="L5920" rel="L5920">knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a</li>
<li class="L5921" rel="L5921">partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.”</li>
<li class="L5922" rel="L5922"></li>
<li class="L5923" rel="L5923">“I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly</li>
<li class="L5924" rel="L5924">beyond my own party.”</li>
<li class="L5925" rel="L5925"></li>
<li class="L5926" rel="L5926">“True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel</li>
<li class="L5927" rel="L5927">Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.”</li>
<li class="L5928" rel="L5928"></li>
<li class="L5929" rel="L5929">“Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better, had I sought an</li>
<li class="L5930" rel="L5930">introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.”</li>
<li class="L5931" rel="L5931"></li>
<li class="L5932" rel="L5932">“Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth, still</li>
<li class="L5933" rel="L5933">addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. “Shall we ask him why a man of sense and</li>
<li class="L5934" rel="L5934">education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend</li>
<li class="L5935" rel="L5935">himself to strangers?”</li>
<li class="L5936" rel="L5936"></li>
<li class="L5937" rel="L5937">“I can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying to</li>
<li class="L5938" rel="L5938">him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.”</li>
<li class="L5939" rel="L5939"></li>
<li class="L5940" rel="L5940">“I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said Darcy,</li>
<li class="L5941" rel="L5941">“of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot</li>
<li class="L5942" rel="L5942">catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their</li>
<li class="L5943" rel="L5943">concerns, as I often see done.”</li>
<li class="L5944" rel="L5944"></li>
<li class="L5945" rel="L5945">“My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the</li>
<li class="L5946" rel="L5946">masterly manner which I see so many women&#39;s do. They have not the same</li>
<li class="L5947" rel="L5947">force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I</li>
<li class="L5948" rel="L5948">have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I will not take the</li>
<li class="L5949" rel="L5949">trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as</li>
<li class="L5950" rel="L5950">capable as any other woman&#39;s of superior execution.”</li>
<li class="L5951" rel="L5951"></li>
<li class="L5952" rel="L5952">Darcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right. You have employed your</li>
<li class="L5953" rel="L5953">time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can</li>
<li class="L5954" rel="L5954">think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.”</li>
<li class="L5955" rel="L5955"></li>
<li class="L5956" rel="L5956">Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know</li>
<li class="L5957" rel="L5957">what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.</li>
<li class="L5958" rel="L5958">Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said</li>
<li class="L5959" rel="L5959">to Darcy:</li>
<li class="L5960" rel="L5960"></li>
<li class="L5961" rel="L5961">“Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and</li>
<li class="L5962" rel="L5962">could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion</li>
<li class="L5963" rel="L5963">of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne&#39;s. Anne would have</li>
<li class="L5964" rel="L5964">been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.”</li>
<li class="L5965" rel="L5965"></li>
<li class="L5966" rel="L5966">Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his</li>
<li class="L5967" rel="L5967">cousin&#39;s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she</li>
<li class="L5968" rel="L5968">discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss</li>
<li class="L5969" rel="L5969">de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have</li>
<li class="L5970" rel="L5970">been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.</li>
<li class="L5971" rel="L5971"></li>
<li class="L5972" rel="L5972">Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth&#39;s performance, mixing</li>
<li class="L5973" rel="L5973">with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received</li>
<li class="L5974" rel="L5974">them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the</li>
<li class="L5975" rel="L5975">gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship&#39;s carriage was</li>
<li class="L5976" rel="L5976">ready to take them all home.</li>
<li class="L5977" rel="L5977"></li>
<li class="L5978" rel="L5978"></li>
<li class="L5979" rel="L5979"></li>
<li class="L5980" rel="L5980">Chapter 32</li>
<li class="L5981" rel="L5981"></li>
<li class="L5982" rel="L5982"></li>
<li class="L5983" rel="L5983">Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane</li>
<li class="L5984" rel="L5984">while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,</li>
<li class="L5985" rel="L5985">when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a</li>
<li class="L5986" rel="L5986">visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to</li>
<li class="L5987" rel="L5987">be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her</li>
<li class="L5988" rel="L5988">half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,</li>
<li class="L5989" rel="L5989">when the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and</li>
<li class="L5990" rel="L5990">Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.</li>
<li class="L5991" rel="L5991"></li>
<li class="L5992" rel="L5992">He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his</li>
<li class="L5993" rel="L5993">intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were</li>
<li class="L5994" rel="L5994">to be within.</li>
<li class="L5995" rel="L5995"></li>
<li class="L5996" rel="L5996">They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,</li>
<li class="L5997" rel="L5997">seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely</li>
<li class="L5998" rel="L5998">necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence</li>
<li class="L5999" rel="L5999">recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and</li>
<li class="L6000" rel="L6000">feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty</li>
<li class="L6001" rel="L6001">departure, she observed:</li>
<li class="L6002" rel="L6002"></li>
<li class="L6003" rel="L6003">“How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!</li>
<li class="L6004" rel="L6004">It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you</li>
<li class="L6005" rel="L6005">all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day</li>
<li class="L6006" rel="L6006">before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?”</li>
<li class="L6007" rel="L6007"></li>
<li class="L6008" rel="L6008">“Perfectly so, I thank you.”</li>
<li class="L6009" rel="L6009"></li>
<li class="L6010" rel="L6010">She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short</li>
<li class="L6011" rel="L6011">pause added:</li>
<li class="L6012" rel="L6012"></li>
<li class="L6013" rel="L6013">“I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever</li>
<li class="L6014" rel="L6014">returning to Netherfield again?”</li>
<li class="L6015" rel="L6015"></li>
<li class="L6016" rel="L6016">“I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend</li>
<li class="L6017" rel="L6017">very little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, and</li>
<li class="L6018" rel="L6018">is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually</li>
<li class="L6019" rel="L6019">increasing.”</li>
<li class="L6020" rel="L6020"></li>
<li class="L6021" rel="L6021">“If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for</li>
<li class="L6022" rel="L6022">the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we</li>
<li class="L6023" rel="L6023">might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did</li>
<li class="L6024" rel="L6024">not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as</li>
<li class="L6025" rel="L6025">for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same</li>
<li class="L6026" rel="L6026">principle.”</li>
<li class="L6027" rel="L6027"></li>
<li class="L6028" rel="L6028">“I should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it up as</li>
<li class="L6029" rel="L6029">soon as any eligible purchase offers.”</li>
<li class="L6030" rel="L6030"></li>
<li class="L6031" rel="L6031">Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his</li>
<li class="L6032" rel="L6032">friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the</li>
<li class="L6033" rel="L6033">trouble of finding a subject to him.</li>
<li class="L6034" rel="L6034"></li>
<li class="L6035" rel="L6035">He took the hint, and soon began with, “This seems a very comfortable</li>
<li class="L6036" rel="L6036">house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.</li>
<li class="L6037" rel="L6037">Collins first came to Hunsford.”</li>
<li class="L6038" rel="L6038"></li>
<li class="L6039" rel="L6039">“I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her</li>
<li class="L6040" rel="L6040">kindness on a more grateful object.”</li>
<li class="L6041" rel="L6041"></li>
<li class="L6042" rel="L6042">“Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.”</li>
<li class="L6043" rel="L6043"></li>
<li class="L6044" rel="L6044">“Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one</li>
<li class="L6045" rel="L6045">of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made</li>
<li class="L6046" rel="L6046">him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though</li>
<li class="L6047" rel="L6047">I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the</li>
<li class="L6048" rel="L6048">wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a</li>
<li class="L6049" rel="L6049">prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.”</li>
<li class="L6050" rel="L6050"></li>
<li class="L6051" rel="L6051">“It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a</li>
<li class="L6052" rel="L6052">distance of her own family and friends.”</li>
<li class="L6053" rel="L6053"></li>
<li class="L6054" rel="L6054">“An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.”</li>
<li class="L6055" rel="L6055"></li>
<li class="L6056" rel="L6056">“And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day&#39;s</li>
<li class="L6057" rel="L6057">journey. Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance.”</li>
<li class="L6058" rel="L6058"></li>
<li class="L6059" rel="L6059">“I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_</li>
<li class="L6060" rel="L6060">of the match,” cried Elizabeth. “I should never have said Mrs. Collins</li>
<li class="L6061" rel="L6061">was settled _near_ her family.”</li>
<li class="L6062" rel="L6062"></li>
<li class="L6063" rel="L6063">“It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond</li>
<li class="L6064" rel="L6064">the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.”</li>
<li class="L6065" rel="L6065"></li>
<li class="L6066" rel="L6066">As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she</li>
<li class="L6067" rel="L6067">understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and</li>
<li class="L6068" rel="L6068">Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:</li>
<li class="L6069" rel="L6069"></li>
<li class="L6070" rel="L6070">“I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her</li>
<li class="L6071" rel="L6071">family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many</li>
<li class="L6072" rel="L6072">varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of</li>
<li class="L6073" rel="L6073">travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the</li>
<li class="L6074" rel="L6074">case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not</li>
<li class="L6075" rel="L6075">such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my</li>
<li class="L6076" rel="L6076">friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_</li>
<li class="L6077" rel="L6077">the present distance.”</li>
<li class="L6078" rel="L6078"></li>
<li class="L6079" rel="L6079">Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “_You_ cannot</li>
<li class="L6080" rel="L6080">have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have</li>
<li class="L6081" rel="L6081">been always at Longbourn.”</li>
<li class="L6082" rel="L6082"></li>
<li class="L6083" rel="L6083">Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of</li>
<li class="L6084" rel="L6084">feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and</li>
<li class="L6085" rel="L6085">glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:</li>
<li class="L6086" rel="L6086"></li>
<li class="L6087" rel="L6087">“Are you pleased with Kent?”</li>
<li class="L6088" rel="L6088"></li>
<li class="L6089" rel="L6089">A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side</li>
<li class="L6090" rel="L6090">calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte</li>
<li class="L6091" rel="L6091">and her sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised</li>
<li class="L6092" rel="L6092">them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding</li>
<li class="L6093" rel="L6093">on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying</li>
<li class="L6094" rel="L6094">much to anybody, went away.</li>
<li class="L6095" rel="L6095"></li>
<li class="L6096" rel="L6096">“What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he was</li>
<li class="L6097" rel="L6097">gone. “My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never</li>
<li class="L6098" rel="L6098">have called us in this familiar way.”</li>
<li class="L6099" rel="L6099"></li>
<li class="L6100" rel="L6100">But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,</li>
<li class="L6101" rel="L6101">even to Charlotte&#39;s wishes, to be the case; and after various</li>
<li class="L6102" rel="L6102">conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from</li>
<li class="L6103" rel="L6103">the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable</li>
<li class="L6104" rel="L6104">from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there</li>
<li class="L6105" rel="L6105">was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot</li>
<li class="L6106" rel="L6106">always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the</li>
<li class="L6107" rel="L6107">pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the</li>
<li class="L6108" rel="L6108">two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither</li>
<li class="L6109" rel="L6109">almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes</li>
<li class="L6110" rel="L6110">separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their</li>
<li class="L6111" rel="L6111">aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he</li>
<li class="L6112" rel="L6112">had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended</li>
<li class="L6113" rel="L6113">him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in</li>
<li class="L6114" rel="L6114">being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her</li>
<li class="L6115" rel="L6115">former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw</li>
<li class="L6116" rel="L6116">there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam&#39;s manners,</li>
<li class="L6117" rel="L6117">she believed he might have the best informed mind.</li>
<li class="L6118" rel="L6118"></li>
<li class="L6119" rel="L6119">But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult</li>
<li class="L6120" rel="L6120">to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there</li>
<li class="L6121" rel="L6121">ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak,</li>
<li class="L6122" rel="L6122">it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice</li>
<li class="L6123" rel="L6123">to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really</li>
<li class="L6124" rel="L6124">animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel</li>
<li class="L6125" rel="L6125">Fitzwilliam&#39;s occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was</li>
<li class="L6126" rel="L6126">generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told</li>
<li class="L6127" rel="L6127">her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect</li>
<li class="L6128" rel="L6128">of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself</li>
<li class="L6129" rel="L6129">seriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at</li>
<li class="L6130" rel="L6130">Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He</li>
<li class="L6131" rel="L6131">certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that</li>
<li class="L6132" rel="L6132">look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often</li>
<li class="L6133" rel="L6133">doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it</li>
<li class="L6134" rel="L6134">seemed nothing but absence of mind.</li>
<li class="L6135" rel="L6135"></li>
<li class="L6136" rel="L6136">She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his</li>
<li class="L6137" rel="L6137">being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.</li>
<li class="L6138" rel="L6138">Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of</li>
<li class="L6139" rel="L6139">raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her</li>
<li class="L6140" rel="L6140">opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend&#39;s dislike would</li>
<li class="L6141" rel="L6141">vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.</li>
<li class="L6142" rel="L6142"></li>
<li class="L6143" rel="L6143"></li>
<li class="L6144" rel="L6144">In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying</li>
<li class="L6145" rel="L6145">Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he</li>
<li class="L6146" rel="L6146">certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,</li>
<li class="L6147" rel="L6147">to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage</li>
<li class="L6148" rel="L6148">in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.</li>
<li class="L6149" rel="L6149"></li>
<li class="L6150" rel="L6150"></li>
<li class="L6151" rel="L6151"></li>
<li class="L6152" rel="L6152">Chapter 33</li>
<li class="L6153" rel="L6153"></li>
<li class="L6154" rel="L6154"></li>
<li class="L6155" rel="L6155">More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,</li>
<li class="L6156" rel="L6156">unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the</li>
<li class="L6157" rel="L6157">mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to</li>
<li class="L6158" rel="L6158">prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that</li>
<li class="L6159" rel="L6159">it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,</li>
<li class="L6160" rel="L6160">therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like</li>
<li class="L6161" rel="L6161">wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was</li>
<li class="L6162" rel="L6162">not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,</li>
<li class="L6163" rel="L6163">but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He</li>
<li class="L6164" rel="L6164">never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking</li>
<li class="L6165" rel="L6165">or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third</li>
<li class="L6166" rel="L6166">rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about</li>
<li class="L6167" rel="L6167">her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her</li>
<li class="L6168" rel="L6168">opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins&#39;s happiness; and that in speaking of</li>
<li class="L6169" rel="L6169">Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to</li>
<li class="L6170" rel="L6170">expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying</li>
<li class="L6171" rel="L6171">_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel</li>
<li class="L6172" rel="L6172">Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must</li>
<li class="L6173" rel="L6173">mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed</li>
<li class="L6174" rel="L6174">her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the</li>
<li class="L6175" rel="L6175">pales opposite the Parsonage.</li>
<li class="L6176" rel="L6176"></li>
<li class="L6177" rel="L6177">She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane&#39;s last letter,</li>
<li class="L6178" rel="L6178">and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in</li>
<li class="L6179" rel="L6179">spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw</li>
<li class="L6180" rel="L6180">on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the</li>
<li class="L6181" rel="L6181">letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:</li>
<li class="L6182" rel="L6182"></li>
<li class="L6183" rel="L6183">“I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”</li>
<li class="L6184" rel="L6184"></li>
<li class="L6185" rel="L6185">“I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I generally</li>
<li class="L6186" rel="L6186">do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are</li>
<li class="L6187" rel="L6187">you going much farther?”</li>
<li class="L6188" rel="L6188"></li>
<li class="L6189" rel="L6189">“No, I should have turned in a moment.”</li>
<li class="L6190" rel="L6190"></li>
<li class="L6191" rel="L6191">And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage</li>
<li class="L6192" rel="L6192">together.</li>
<li class="L6193" rel="L6193"></li>
<li class="L6194" rel="L6194">“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.</li>
<li class="L6195" rel="L6195"></li>
<li class="L6196" rel="L6196">“Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He</li>
<li class="L6197" rel="L6197">arranges the business just as he pleases.”</li>
<li class="L6198" rel="L6198"></li>
<li class="L6199" rel="L6199">“And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least</li>
<li class="L6200" rel="L6200">pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems</li>
<li class="L6201" rel="L6201">more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.”</li>
<li class="L6202" rel="L6202"></li>
<li class="L6203" rel="L6203">“He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.</li>
<li class="L6204" rel="L6204">“But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it</li>
<li class="L6205" rel="L6205">than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak</li>
<li class="L6206" rel="L6206">feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and</li>
<li class="L6207" rel="L6207">dependence.”</li>
<li class="L6208" rel="L6208"></li>
<li class="L6209" rel="L6209">“In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of</li>
<li class="L6210" rel="L6210">either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and</li>
<li class="L6211" rel="L6211">dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going</li>
<li class="L6212" rel="L6212">wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”</li>
<li class="L6213" rel="L6213"></li>
<li class="L6214" rel="L6214">“These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have</li>
<li class="L6215" rel="L6215">experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater</li>
<li class="L6216" rel="L6216">weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where</li>
<li class="L6217" rel="L6217">they like.”</li>
<li class="L6218" rel="L6218"></li>
<li class="L6219" rel="L6219">“Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often</li>
<li class="L6220" rel="L6220">do.”</li>
<li class="L6221" rel="L6221"></li>
<li class="L6222" rel="L6222">“Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many</li>
<li class="L6223" rel="L6223">in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to</li>
<li class="L6224" rel="L6224">money.”</li>
<li class="L6225" rel="L6225"></li>
<li class="L6226" rel="L6226">“Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the</li>
<li class="L6227" rel="L6227">idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray, what</li>
<li class="L6228" rel="L6228">is the usual price of an earl&#39;s younger son? Unless the elder brother is</li>
<li class="L6229" rel="L6229">very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”</li>
<li class="L6230" rel="L6230"></li>
<li class="L6231" rel="L6231">He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt</li>
<li class="L6232" rel="L6232">a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,</li>
<li class="L6233" rel="L6233">she soon afterwards said:</li>
<li class="L6234" rel="L6234"></li>
<li class="L6235" rel="L6235">“I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of</li>
<li class="L6236" rel="L6236">having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a</li>
<li class="L6237" rel="L6237">lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well</li>
<li class="L6238" rel="L6238">for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he</li>
<li class="L6239" rel="L6239">likes with her.”</li>
<li class="L6240" rel="L6240"></li>
<li class="L6241" rel="L6241">“No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he must</li>
<li class="L6242" rel="L6242">divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.”</li>
<li class="L6243" rel="L6243"></li>
<li class="L6244" rel="L6244">“Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your</li>
<li class="L6245" rel="L6245">charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a</li>
<li class="L6246" rel="L6246">little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she</li>
<li class="L6247" rel="L6247">may like to have her own way.”</li>
<li class="L6248" rel="L6248"></li>
<li class="L6249" rel="L6249">As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner</li>
<li class="L6250" rel="L6250">in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to</li>
<li class="L6251" rel="L6251">give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other</li>
<li class="L6252" rel="L6252">got pretty near the truth. She directly replied:</li>
<li class="L6253" rel="L6253"></li>
<li class="L6254" rel="L6254">“You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare</li>
<li class="L6255" rel="L6255">say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a</li>
<li class="L6256" rel="L6256">very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and</li>
<li class="L6257" rel="L6257">Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.”</li>
<li class="L6258" rel="L6258"></li>
<li class="L6259" rel="L6259">“I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man--he</li>
<li class="L6260" rel="L6260">is a great friend of Darcy&#39;s.”</li>
<li class="L6261" rel="L6261"></li>
<li class="L6262" rel="L6262">“Oh! yes,” said Elizabeth drily; “Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.</li>
<li class="L6263" rel="L6263">Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”</li>
<li class="L6264" rel="L6264"></li>
<li class="L6265" rel="L6265">“Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in</li>
<li class="L6266" rel="L6266">those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in</li>
<li class="L6267" rel="L6267">our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to</li>
<li class="L6268" rel="L6268">him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that</li>
<li class="L6269" rel="L6269">Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.”</li>
<li class="L6270" rel="L6270"></li>
<li class="L6271" rel="L6271">“What is it you mean?”</li>
<li class="L6272" rel="L6272"></li>
<li class="L6273" rel="L6273">“It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known,</li>
<li class="L6274" rel="L6274">because if it were to get round to the lady&#39;s family, it would be an</li>
<li class="L6275" rel="L6275">unpleasant thing.”</li>
<li class="L6276" rel="L6276"></li>
<li class="L6277" rel="L6277">“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”</li>
<li class="L6278" rel="L6278"></li>
<li class="L6279" rel="L6279">“And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be</li>
<li class="L6280" rel="L6280">Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself</li>
<li class="L6281" rel="L6281">on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most</li>
<li class="L6282" rel="L6282">imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other</li>
<li class="L6283" rel="L6283">particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing</li>
<li class="L6284" rel="L6284">him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from</li>
<li class="L6285" rel="L6285">knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”</li>
<li class="L6286" rel="L6286"></li>
<li class="L6287" rel="L6287">“Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?”</li>
<li class="L6288" rel="L6288"></li>
<li class="L6289" rel="L6289">“I understood that there were some very strong objections against the</li>
<li class="L6290" rel="L6290">lady.”</li>
<li class="L6291" rel="L6291"></li>
<li class="L6292" rel="L6292">“And what arts did he use to separate them?”</li>
<li class="L6293" rel="L6293"></li>
<li class="L6294" rel="L6294">“He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling. “He</li>
<li class="L6295" rel="L6295">only told me what I have now told you.”</li>
<li class="L6296" rel="L6296"></li>
<li class="L6297" rel="L6297">Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with</li>
<li class="L6298" rel="L6298">indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she</li>
<li class="L6299" rel="L6299">was so thoughtful.</li>
<li class="L6300" rel="L6300"></li>
<li class="L6301" rel="L6301">“I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “Your</li>
<li class="L6302" rel="L6302">cousin&#39;s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?”</li>
<li class="L6303" rel="L6303"></li>
<li class="L6304" rel="L6304">“You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”</li>
<li class="L6305" rel="L6305"></li>
<li class="L6306" rel="L6306">“I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his</li>
<li class="L6307" rel="L6307">friend&#39;s inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to</li>
<li class="L6308" rel="L6308">determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy.</li>
<li class="L6309" rel="L6309">But,” she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the</li>
<li class="L6310" rel="L6310">particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed</li>
<li class="L6311" rel="L6311">that there was much affection in the case.”</li>
<li class="L6312" rel="L6312"></li>
<li class="L6313" rel="L6313">“That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam, “but it is a</li>
<li class="L6314" rel="L6314">lessening of the honour of my cousin&#39;s triumph very sadly.”</li>
<li class="L6315" rel="L6315"></li>
<li class="L6316" rel="L6316">This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture</li>
<li class="L6317" rel="L6317">of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and</li>
<li class="L6318" rel="L6318">therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent</li>
<li class="L6319" rel="L6319">matters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,</li>
<li class="L6320" rel="L6320">as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption</li>
<li class="L6321" rel="L6321">of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other</li>
<li class="L6322" rel="L6322">people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There</li>
<li class="L6323" rel="L6323">could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have</li>
<li class="L6324" rel="L6324">such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures</li>
<li class="L6325" rel="L6325">taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had</li>
<li class="L6326" rel="L6326">always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement</li>
<li class="L6327" rel="L6327">of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was</li>
<li class="L6328" rel="L6328">the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had</li>
<li class="L6329" rel="L6329">suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while</li>
<li class="L6330" rel="L6330">every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the</li>
<li class="L6331" rel="L6331">world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.</li>
<li class="L6332" rel="L6332"></li>
<li class="L6333" rel="L6333">“There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were Colonel</li>
<li class="L6334" rel="L6334">Fitzwilliam&#39;s words; and those strong objections probably were, her</li>
<li class="L6335" rel="L6335">having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in</li>
<li class="L6336" rel="L6336">business in London.</li>
<li class="L6337" rel="L6337"></li>
<li class="L6338" rel="L6338">“To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of</li>
<li class="L6339" rel="L6339">objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!--her understanding</li>
<li class="L6340" rel="L6340">excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither</li>
<li class="L6341" rel="L6341">could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some</li>
<li class="L6342" rel="L6342">peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and</li>
<li class="L6343" rel="L6343">respectability which he will probably never reach.” When she thought of</li>
<li class="L6344" rel="L6344">her mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow</li>
<li class="L6345" rel="L6345">that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose</li>
<li class="L6346" rel="L6346">pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of</li>
<li class="L6347" rel="L6347">importance in his friend&#39;s connections, than from their want of sense;</li>
<li class="L6348" rel="L6348">and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed</li>
<li class="L6349" rel="L6349">by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr.</li>
<li class="L6350" rel="L6350">Bingley for his sister.</li>
<li class="L6351" rel="L6351"></li>
<li class="L6352" rel="L6352">The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a</li>
<li class="L6353" rel="L6353">headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to</li>
<li class="L6354" rel="L6354">her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her</li>
<li class="L6355" rel="L6355">cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,</li>
<li class="L6356" rel="L6356">seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much</li>
<li class="L6357" rel="L6357">as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins</li>
<li class="L6358" rel="L6358">could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine&#39;s being rather</li>
<li class="L6359" rel="L6359">displeased by her staying at home.</li>
<li class="L6360" rel="L6360"></li>
<li class="L6361" rel="L6361"></li>
<li class="L6362" rel="L6362"></li>
<li class="L6363" rel="L6363">Chapter 34</li>
<li class="L6364" rel="L6364"></li>
<li class="L6365" rel="L6365"></li>
<li class="L6366" rel="L6366">When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself</li>
<li class="L6367" rel="L6367">as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the</li>
<li class="L6368" rel="L6368">examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her</li>
<li class="L6369" rel="L6369">being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any</li>
<li class="L6370" rel="L6370">revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.</li>
<li class="L6371" rel="L6371">But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that</li>
<li class="L6372" rel="L6372">cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which,</li>
<li class="L6373" rel="L6373">proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly</li>
<li class="L6374" rel="L6374">disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth</li>
<li class="L6375" rel="L6375">noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an</li>
<li class="L6376" rel="L6376">attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy&#39;s</li>
<li class="L6377" rel="L6377">shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her</li>
<li class="L6378" rel="L6378">a keener sense of her sister&#39;s sufferings. It was some consolation</li>
<li class="L6379" rel="L6379">to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the</li>
<li class="L6380" rel="L6380">next--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should</li>
<li class="L6381" rel="L6381">herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of</li>
<li class="L6382" rel="L6382">her spirits, by all that affection could do.</li>
<li class="L6383" rel="L6383"></li>
<li class="L6384" rel="L6384">She could not think of Darcy&#39;s leaving Kent without remembering that</li>
<li class="L6385" rel="L6385">his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear</li>
<li class="L6386" rel="L6386">that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not</li>
<li class="L6387" rel="L6387">mean to be unhappy about him.</li>
<li class="L6388" rel="L6388"></li>
<li class="L6389" rel="L6389">While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the</li>
<li class="L6390" rel="L6390">door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its</li>
<li class="L6391" rel="L6391">being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in</li>
<li class="L6392" rel="L6392">the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.</li>
<li class="L6393" rel="L6393">But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently</li>
<li class="L6394" rel="L6394">affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the</li>
<li class="L6395" rel="L6395">room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her</li>
<li class="L6396" rel="L6396">health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.</li>
<li class="L6397" rel="L6397">She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and</li>
<li class="L6398" rel="L6398">then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but</li>
<li class="L6399" rel="L6399">said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her</li>
<li class="L6400" rel="L6400">in an agitated manner, and thus began:</li>
<li class="L6401" rel="L6401"></li>
<li class="L6402" rel="L6402">“In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be</li>
<li class="L6403" rel="L6403">repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love</li>
<li class="L6404" rel="L6404">you.”</li>
<li class="L6405" rel="L6405"></li>
<li class="L6406" rel="L6406">Elizabeth&#39;s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,</li>
<li class="L6407" rel="L6407">doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement;</li>
<li class="L6408" rel="L6408">and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her,</li>
<li class="L6409" rel="L6409">immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides</li>
<li class="L6410" rel="L6410">those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the</li>
<li class="L6411" rel="L6411">subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of</li>
<li class="L6412" rel="L6412">its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which had always</li>
<li class="L6413" rel="L6413">opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to</li>
<li class="L6414" rel="L6414">the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his</li>
<li class="L6415" rel="L6415">suit.</li>
<li class="L6416" rel="L6416"></li>
<li class="L6417" rel="L6417">In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to</li>
<li class="L6418" rel="L6418">the compliment of such a man&#39;s affection, and though her intentions did</li>
<li class="L6419" rel="L6419">not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to</li>
<li class="L6420" rel="L6420">receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she</li>
<li class="L6421" rel="L6421">lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to</li>
<li class="L6422" rel="L6422">answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with</li>
<li class="L6423" rel="L6423">representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite</li>
<li class="L6424" rel="L6424">of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with</li>
<li class="L6425" rel="L6425">expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of</li>
<li class="L6426" rel="L6426">his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt</li>
<li class="L6427" rel="L6427">of a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but</li>
<li class="L6428" rel="L6428">his countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could</li>
<li class="L6429" rel="L6429">only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her</li>
<li class="L6430" rel="L6430">cheeks, and she said:</li>
<li class="L6431" rel="L6431"></li>
<li class="L6432" rel="L6432">“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to</li>
<li class="L6433" rel="L6433">express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however</li>
<li class="L6434" rel="L6434">unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should</li>
<li class="L6435" rel="L6435">be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I</li>
<li class="L6436" rel="L6436">cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly</li>
<li class="L6437" rel="L6437">bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to</li>
<li class="L6438" rel="L6438">anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be</li>
<li class="L6439" rel="L6439">of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented</li>
<li class="L6440" rel="L6440">the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in</li>
<li class="L6441" rel="L6441">overcoming it after this explanation.”</li>
<li class="L6442" rel="L6442"></li>
<li class="L6443" rel="L6443">Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed</li>
<li class="L6444" rel="L6444">on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than</li>
<li class="L6445" rel="L6445">surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance</li>
<li class="L6446" rel="L6446">of his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the</li>
<li class="L6447" rel="L6447">appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed</li>
<li class="L6448" rel="L6448">himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth&#39;s feelings</li>
<li class="L6449" rel="L6449">dreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:</li>
<li class="L6450" rel="L6450"></li>
<li class="L6451" rel="L6451">“And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!</li>
<li class="L6452" rel="L6452">I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at</li>
<li class="L6453" rel="L6453">civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.”</li>
<li class="L6454" rel="L6454"></li>
<li class="L6455" rel="L6455">“I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why with so evident a desire</li>
<li class="L6456" rel="L6456">of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me</li>
<li class="L6457" rel="L6457">against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?</li>
<li class="L6458" rel="L6458">Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have</li>
<li class="L6459" rel="L6459">other provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against</li>
<li class="L6460" rel="L6460">you--had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you</li>
<li class="L6461" rel="L6461">think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has</li>
<li class="L6462" rel="L6462">been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most</li>
<li class="L6463" rel="L6463">beloved sister?”</li>
<li class="L6464" rel="L6464"></li>
<li class="L6465" rel="L6465">As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion</li>
<li class="L6466" rel="L6466">was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she</li>
<li class="L6467" rel="L6467">continued:</li>
<li class="L6468" rel="L6468"></li>
<li class="L6469" rel="L6469">“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can</li>
<li class="L6470" rel="L6470">excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,</li>
<li class="L6471" rel="L6471">you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means</li>
<li class="L6472" rel="L6472">of dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of the</li>
<li class="L6473" rel="L6473">world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for</li>
<li class="L6474" rel="L6474">disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest</li>
<li class="L6475" rel="L6475">kind.”</li>
<li class="L6476" rel="L6476"></li>
<li class="L6477" rel="L6477">She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening</li>
<li class="L6478" rel="L6478">with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.</li>
<li class="L6479" rel="L6479">He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.</li>
<li class="L6480" rel="L6480"></li>
<li class="L6481" rel="L6481">“Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.</li>
<li class="L6482" rel="L6482"></li>
<li class="L6483" rel="L6483">With assumed tranquillity he then replied: “I have no wish of denying</li>
<li class="L6484" rel="L6484">that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your</li>
<li class="L6485" rel="L6485">sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been</li>
<li class="L6486" rel="L6486">kinder than towards myself.”</li>
<li class="L6487" rel="L6487"></li>
<li class="L6488" rel="L6488">Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,</li>
<li class="L6489" rel="L6489">but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.</li>
<li class="L6490" rel="L6490"></li>
<li class="L6491" rel="L6491">“But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike</li>
<li class="L6492" rel="L6492">is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was</li>
<li class="L6493" rel="L6493">decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received</li>
<li class="L6494" rel="L6494">many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to</li>
<li class="L6495" rel="L6495">say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?</li>
<li class="L6496" rel="L6496">or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”</li>
<li class="L6497" rel="L6497"></li>
<li class="L6498" rel="L6498">“You take an eager interest in that gentleman&#39;s concerns,” said Darcy,</li>
<li class="L6499" rel="L6499">in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.</li>
<li class="L6500" rel="L6500"></li>
<li class="L6501" rel="L6501">“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an</li>
<li class="L6502" rel="L6502">interest in him?”</li>
<li class="L6503" rel="L6503"></li>
<li class="L6504" rel="L6504">“His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy contemptuously; “yes, his misfortunes</li>
<li class="L6505" rel="L6505">have been great indeed.”</li>
<li class="L6506" rel="L6506"></li>
<li class="L6507" rel="L6507">“And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth with energy. “You have reduced</li>
<li class="L6508" rel="L6508">him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You have</li>
<li class="L6509" rel="L6509">withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for</li>
<li class="L6510" rel="L6510">him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence</li>
<li class="L6511" rel="L6511">which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this!</li>
<li class="L6512" rel="L6512">and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and</li>
<li class="L6513" rel="L6513">ridicule.”</li>
<li class="L6514" rel="L6514"></li>
<li class="L6515" rel="L6515">“And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,</li>
<li class="L6516" rel="L6516">“is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me!</li>
<li class="L6517" rel="L6517">I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this</li>
<li class="L6518" rel="L6518">calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,” added he, stopping in</li>
<li class="L6519" rel="L6519">his walk, and turning towards her, “these offenses might have been</li>
<li class="L6520" rel="L6520">overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the</li>
<li class="L6521" rel="L6521">scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These</li>
<li class="L6522" rel="L6522">bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater</li>
<li class="L6523" rel="L6523">policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of</li>
<li class="L6524" rel="L6524">my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by</li>
<li class="L6525" rel="L6525">reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.</li>
<li class="L6526" rel="L6526">Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and</li>
<li class="L6527" rel="L6527">just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your</li>
<li class="L6528" rel="L6528">connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose</li>
<li class="L6529" rel="L6529">condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”</li>
<li class="L6530" rel="L6530"></li>
<li class="L6531" rel="L6531">Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to</li>
<li class="L6532" rel="L6532">the utmost to speak with composure when she said:</li>
<li class="L6533" rel="L6533"></li>
<li class="L6534" rel="L6534">“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your</li>
<li class="L6535" rel="L6535">declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern</li>
<li class="L6536" rel="L6536">which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more</li>
<li class="L6537" rel="L6537">gentlemanlike manner.”</li>
<li class="L6538" rel="L6538"></li>
<li class="L6539" rel="L6539">She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:</li>
<li class="L6540" rel="L6540"></li>
<li class="L6541" rel="L6541">“You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that</li>
<li class="L6542" rel="L6542">would have tempted me to accept it.”</li>
<li class="L6543" rel="L6543"></li>
<li class="L6544" rel="L6544">Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an</li>
<li class="L6545" rel="L6545">expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:</li>
<li class="L6546" rel="L6546"></li>
<li class="L6547" rel="L6547">“From the very beginning--from the first moment, I may almost say--of</li>
<li class="L6548" rel="L6548">my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest</li>
<li class="L6549" rel="L6549">belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of</li>
<li class="L6550" rel="L6550">the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of</li>
<li class="L6551" rel="L6551">disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a</li>
<li class="L6552" rel="L6552">dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the</li>
<li class="L6553" rel="L6553">last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”</li>
<li class="L6554" rel="L6554"></li>
<li class="L6555" rel="L6555">“You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your</li>
<li class="L6556" rel="L6556">feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.</li>
<li class="L6557" rel="L6557">Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best</li>
<li class="L6558" rel="L6558">wishes for your health and happiness.”</li>
<li class="L6559" rel="L6559"></li>
<li class="L6560" rel="L6560">And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him</li>
<li class="L6561" rel="L6561">the next moment open the front door and quit the house.</li>
<li class="L6562" rel="L6562"></li>
<li class="L6563" rel="L6563">The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how</li>
<li class="L6564" rel="L6564">to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for</li>
<li class="L6565" rel="L6565">half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed,</li>
<li class="L6566" rel="L6566">was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of</li>
<li class="L6567" rel="L6567">marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for</li>
<li class="L6568" rel="L6568">so many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of</li>
<li class="L6569" rel="L6569">all the objections which had made him prevent his friend&#39;s marrying</li>
<li class="L6570" rel="L6570">her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his</li>
<li class="L6571" rel="L6571">own case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired</li>
<li class="L6572" rel="L6572">unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable</li>
<li class="L6573" rel="L6573">pride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to</li>
<li class="L6574" rel="L6574">Jane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could</li>
<li class="L6575" rel="L6575">not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.</li>
<li class="L6576" rel="L6576">Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon</li>
<li class="L6577" rel="L6577">overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for</li>
<li class="L6578" rel="L6578">a moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the</li>
<li class="L6579" rel="L6579">sound of Lady Catherine&#39;s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to</li>
<li class="L6580" rel="L6580">encounter Charlotte&#39;s observation, and hurried her away to her room.</li>
<li class="L6581" rel="L6581"></li>
<li class="L6582" rel="L6582"></li>
<li class="L6583" rel="L6583"></li>
<li class="L6584" rel="L6584">Chapter 35</li>
<li class="L6585" rel="L6585"></li>
<li class="L6586" rel="L6586"></li>
<li class="L6587" rel="L6587">Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations</li>
<li class="L6588" rel="L6588">which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the</li>
<li class="L6589" rel="L6589">surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything</li>
<li class="L6590" rel="L6590">else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after</li>
<li class="L6591" rel="L6591">breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding</li>
<li class="L6592" rel="L6592">directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy&#39;s</li>
<li class="L6593" rel="L6593">sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,</li>
<li class="L6594" rel="L6594">she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The</li>
<li class="L6595" rel="L6595">park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one</li>
<li class="L6596" rel="L6596">of the gates into the ground.</li>
<li class="L6597" rel="L6597"></li>
<li class="L6598" rel="L6598">After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was</li>
<li class="L6599" rel="L6599">tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and</li>
<li class="L6600" rel="L6600">look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had</li>
<li class="L6601" rel="L6601">made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the</li>
<li class="L6602" rel="L6602">verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,</li>
<li class="L6603" rel="L6603">when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which</li>
<li class="L6604" rel="L6604">edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr.</li>
<li class="L6605" rel="L6605">Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now</li>
<li class="L6606" rel="L6606">near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced</li>
<li class="L6607" rel="L6607">her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though</li>
<li class="L6608" rel="L6608">in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the</li>
<li class="L6609" rel="L6609">gate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter,</li>
<li class="L6610" rel="L6610">which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure,</li>
<li class="L6611" rel="L6611">“I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.</li>
<li class="L6612" rel="L6612">Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” And then, with a</li>
<li class="L6613" rel="L6613">slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.</li>
<li class="L6614" rel="L6614"></li>
<li class="L6615" rel="L6615">With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,</li>
<li class="L6616" rel="L6616">Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,</li>
<li class="L6617" rel="L6617">perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written</li>
<li class="L6618" rel="L6618">quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise</li>
<li class="L6619" rel="L6619">full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated</li>
<li class="L6620" rel="L6620">from Rosings, at eight o&#39;clock in the morning, and was as follows:--</li>
<li class="L6621" rel="L6621"></li>
<li class="L6622" rel="L6622">“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension</li>
<li class="L6623" rel="L6623">of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those</li>
<li class="L6624" rel="L6624">offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any</li>
<li class="L6625" rel="L6625">intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes</li>
<li class="L6626" rel="L6626">which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the</li>
<li class="L6627" rel="L6627">effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,</li>
<li class="L6628" rel="L6628">should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written</li>
<li class="L6629" rel="L6629">and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand</li>
<li class="L6630" rel="L6630">your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I</li>
<li class="L6631" rel="L6631">demand it of your justice.</li>
<li class="L6632" rel="L6632"></li>
<li class="L6633" rel="L6633">“Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal</li>
<li class="L6634" rel="L6634">magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,</li>
<li class="L6635" rel="L6635">that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley</li>
<li class="L6636" rel="L6636">from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various</li>
<li class="L6637" rel="L6637">claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate</li>
<li class="L6638" rel="L6638">prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and</li>
<li class="L6639" rel="L6639">wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged</li>
<li class="L6640" rel="L6640">favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other</li>
<li class="L6641" rel="L6641">dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect</li>
<li class="L6642" rel="L6642">its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young</li>
<li class="L6643" rel="L6643">persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could</li>
<li class="L6644" rel="L6644">bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last</li>
<li class="L6645" rel="L6645">night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope</li>
<li class="L6646" rel="L6646">to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions</li>
<li class="L6647" rel="L6647">and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which</li>
<li class="L6648" rel="L6648">is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which</li>
<li class="L6649" rel="L6649">may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity</li>
<li class="L6650" rel="L6650">must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.</li>
<li class="L6651" rel="L6651"></li>
<li class="L6652" rel="L6652">“I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with</li>
<li class="L6653" rel="L6653">others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young</li>
<li class="L6654" rel="L6654">woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance</li>
<li class="L6655" rel="L6655">at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious</li>
<li class="L6656" rel="L6656">attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I</li>
<li class="L6657" rel="L6657">had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir</li>
<li class="L6658" rel="L6658">William Lucas&#39;s accidental information, that Bingley&#39;s attentions to</li>
<li class="L6659" rel="L6659">your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.</li>
<li class="L6660" rel="L6660">He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could</li>
<li class="L6661" rel="L6661">be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend&#39;s behaviour</li>
<li class="L6662" rel="L6662">attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss</li>
<li class="L6663" rel="L6663">Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also</li>
<li class="L6664" rel="L6664">watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever,</li>
<li class="L6665" rel="L6665">but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced</li>
<li class="L6666" rel="L6666">from the evening&#39;s scrutiny, that though she received his attentions</li>
<li class="L6667" rel="L6667">with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of</li>
<li class="L6668" rel="L6668">sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been</li>
<li class="L6669" rel="L6669">in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter</li>
<li class="L6670" rel="L6670">probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict</li>
<li class="L6671" rel="L6671">pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not</li>
<li class="L6672" rel="L6672">scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister&#39;s countenance and</li>
<li class="L6673" rel="L6673">air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction</li>
<li class="L6674" rel="L6674">that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be</li>
<li class="L6675" rel="L6675">easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is</li>
<li class="L6676" rel="L6676">certain--but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions</li>
<li class="L6677" rel="L6677">are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe</li>
<li class="L6678" rel="L6678">her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial</li>
<li class="L6679" rel="L6679">conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the</li>
<li class="L6680" rel="L6680">marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have</li>
<li class="L6681" rel="L6681">the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of</li>
<li class="L6682" rel="L6682">connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But</li>
<li class="L6683" rel="L6683">there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still</li>
<li class="L6684" rel="L6684">existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had</li>
<li class="L6685" rel="L6685">myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before</li>
<li class="L6686" rel="L6686">me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your</li>
<li class="L6687" rel="L6687">mother&#39;s family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that</li>
<li class="L6688" rel="L6688">total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by</li>
<li class="L6689" rel="L6689">herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your</li>
<li class="L6690" rel="L6690">father. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern</li>
<li class="L6691" rel="L6691">for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this</li>
<li class="L6692" rel="L6692">representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to</li>
<li class="L6693" rel="L6693">have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure,</li>
<li class="L6694" rel="L6694">is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than</li>
<li class="L6695" rel="L6695">it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say</li>
<li class="L6696" rel="L6696">farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties</li>
<li class="L6697" rel="L6697">was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led</li>
<li class="L6698" rel="L6698">me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy</li>
<li class="L6699" rel="L6699">connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as</li>
<li class="L6700" rel="L6700">you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.</li>
<li class="L6701" rel="L6701"></li>
<li class="L6702" rel="L6702">“The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters&#39; uneasiness</li>
<li class="L6703" rel="L6703">had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was</li>
<li class="L6704" rel="L6704">soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in</li>
<li class="L6705" rel="L6705">detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in</li>
<li class="L6706" rel="L6706">London. We accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office</li>
<li class="L6707" rel="L6707">of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I</li>
<li class="L6708" rel="L6708">described, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance</li>
<li class="L6709" rel="L6709">might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose</li>
<li class="L6710" rel="L6710">that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been</li>
<li class="L6711" rel="L6711">seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your</li>
<li class="L6712" rel="L6712">sister&#39;s indifference. He had before believed her to return his</li>
<li class="L6713" rel="L6713">affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great</li>
<li class="L6714" rel="L6714">natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his</li>
<li class="L6715" rel="L6715">own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was</li>
<li class="L6716" rel="L6716">no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into</li>
<li class="L6717" rel="L6717">Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the</li>
<li class="L6718" rel="L6718">work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There</li>
<li class="L6719" rel="L6719">is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not</li>
<li class="L6720" rel="L6720">reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the</li>
<li class="L6721" rel="L6721">measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister&#39;s being in</li>
<li class="L6722" rel="L6722">town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her</li>
<li class="L6723" rel="L6723">brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without</li>
<li class="L6724" rel="L6724">ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me</li>
<li class="L6725" rel="L6725">enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this</li>
<li class="L6726" rel="L6726">concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it</li>
<li class="L6727" rel="L6727">was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no</li>
<li class="L6728" rel="L6728">other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister&#39;s feelings, it</li>
<li class="L6729" rel="L6729">was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to</li>
<li class="L6730" rel="L6730">you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn</li>
<li class="L6731" rel="L6731">them.</li>
<li class="L6732" rel="L6732"></li>
<li class="L6733" rel="L6733">“With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured</li>
<li class="L6734" rel="L6734">Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his</li>
<li class="L6735" rel="L6735">connection with my family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I</li>
<li class="L6736" rel="L6736">am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more</li>
<li class="L6737" rel="L6737">than one witness of undoubted veracity.</li>
<li class="L6738" rel="L6738"></li>
<li class="L6739" rel="L6739">“Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many</li>
<li class="L6740" rel="L6740">years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good</li>
<li class="L6741" rel="L6741">conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to</li>
<li class="L6742" rel="L6742">be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his</li>
<li class="L6743" rel="L6743">kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at</li>
<li class="L6744" rel="L6744">school, and afterwards at Cambridge--most important assistance, as his</li>
<li class="L6745" rel="L6745">own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have</li>
<li class="L6746" rel="L6746">been unable to give him a gentleman&#39;s education. My father was not only</li>
<li class="L6747" rel="L6747">fond of this young man&#39;s society, whose manners were always engaging; he</li>
<li class="L6748" rel="L6748">had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be</li>
<li class="L6749" rel="L6749">his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is</li>
<li class="L6750" rel="L6750">many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different</li>
<li class="L6751" rel="L6751">manner. The vicious propensities--the want of principle, which he was</li>
<li class="L6752" rel="L6752">careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape</li>
<li class="L6753" rel="L6753">the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself,</li>
<li class="L6754" rel="L6754">and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.</li>
<li class="L6755" rel="L6755">Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree</li>
<li class="L6756" rel="L6756">you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham</li>
<li class="L6757" rel="L6757">has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from</li>
<li class="L6758" rel="L6758">unfolding his real character--it adds even another motive.</li>
<li class="L6759" rel="L6759"></li>
<li class="L6760" rel="L6760">“My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to</li>
<li class="L6761" rel="L6761">Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly</li>
<li class="L6762" rel="L6762">recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner</li>
<li class="L6763" rel="L6763">that his profession might allow--and if he took orders, desired that a</li>
<li class="L6764" rel="L6764">valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There</li>
<li class="L6765" rel="L6765">was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long</li>
<li class="L6766" rel="L6766">survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham</li>
<li class="L6767" rel="L6767">wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders,</li>
<li class="L6768" rel="L6768">he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more</li>
<li class="L6769" rel="L6769">immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he</li>
<li class="L6770" rel="L6770">could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying</li>
<li class="L6771" rel="L6771">law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would</li>
<li class="L6772" rel="L6772">be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed</li>
<li class="L6773" rel="L6773">him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to</li>
<li class="L6774" rel="L6774">his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the</li>
<li class="L6775" rel="L6775">business was therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistance</li>
<li class="L6776" rel="L6776">in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to</li>
<li class="L6777" rel="L6777">receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection</li>
<li class="L6778" rel="L6778">between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him</li>
<li class="L6779" rel="L6779">to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly</li>
<li class="L6780" rel="L6780">lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free</li>
<li class="L6781" rel="L6781">from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.</li>
<li class="L6782" rel="L6782">For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the</li>
<li class="L6783" rel="L6783">incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to</li>
<li class="L6784" rel="L6784">me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured</li>
<li class="L6785" rel="L6785">me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He</li>
<li class="L6786" rel="L6786">had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely</li>
<li class="L6787" rel="L6787">resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in</li>
<li class="L6788" rel="L6788">question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was</li>
<li class="L6789" rel="L6789">well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not</li>
<li class="L6790" rel="L6790">have forgotten my revered father&#39;s intentions. You will hardly blame</li>
<li class="L6791" rel="L6791">me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every</li>
<li class="L6792" rel="L6792">repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of</li>
<li class="L6793" rel="L6793">his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me</li>
<li class="L6794" rel="L6794">to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every</li>
<li class="L6795" rel="L6795">appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But</li>
<li class="L6796" rel="L6796">last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.</li>
<li class="L6797" rel="L6797"></li>
<li class="L6798" rel="L6798">“I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself,</li>
<li class="L6799" rel="L6799">and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold</li>
<li class="L6800" rel="L6800">to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your</li>
<li class="L6801" rel="L6801">secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to</li>
<li class="L6802" rel="L6802">the guardianship of my mother&#39;s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.</li>
<li class="L6803" rel="L6803">About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed</li>
<li class="L6804" rel="L6804">for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided</li>
<li class="L6805" rel="L6805">over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by</li>
<li class="L6806" rel="L6806">design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him</li>
<li class="L6807" rel="L6807">and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and</li>
<li class="L6808" rel="L6808">by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,</li>
<li class="L6809" rel="L6809">whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to</li>
<li class="L6810" rel="L6810">her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and</li>
<li class="L6811" rel="L6811">to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her</li>
<li class="L6812" rel="L6812">excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed</li>
<li class="L6813" rel="L6813">the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two</li>
<li class="L6814" rel="L6814">before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the</li>
<li class="L6815" rel="L6815">idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as</li>
<li class="L6816" rel="L6816">a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and</li>
<li class="L6817" rel="L6817">how I acted. Regard for my sister&#39;s credit and feelings prevented</li>
<li class="L6818" rel="L6818">any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place</li>
<li class="L6819" rel="L6819">immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr.</li>
<li class="L6820" rel="L6820">Wickham&#39;s chief object was unquestionably my sister&#39;s fortune, which</li>
<li class="L6821" rel="L6821">is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of</li>
<li class="L6822" rel="L6822">revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have</li>
<li class="L6823" rel="L6823">been complete indeed.</li>
<li class="L6824" rel="L6824"></li>
<li class="L6825" rel="L6825">“This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have</li>
<li class="L6826" rel="L6826">been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as</li>
<li class="L6827" rel="L6827">false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr.</li>
<li class="L6828" rel="L6828">Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he</li>
<li class="L6829" rel="L6829">had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered</li>
<li class="L6830" rel="L6830">at. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either,</li>
<li class="L6831" rel="L6831">detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in</li>
<li class="L6832" rel="L6832">your inclination.</li>
<li class="L6833" rel="L6833"></li>
<li class="L6834" rel="L6834">“You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but</li>
<li class="L6835" rel="L6835">I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to</li>
<li class="L6836" rel="L6836">be revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more</li>
<li class="L6837" rel="L6837">particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our</li>
<li class="L6838" rel="L6838">near relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of</li>
<li class="L6839" rel="L6839">the executors of my father&#39;s will, has been unavoidably acquainted</li>
<li class="L6840" rel="L6840">with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of _me_</li>
<li class="L6841" rel="L6841">should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by</li>
<li class="L6842" rel="L6842">the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be</li>
<li class="L6843" rel="L6843">the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some</li>
<li class="L6844" rel="L6844">opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the</li>
<li class="L6845" rel="L6845">morning. I will only add, God bless you.</li>
<li class="L6846" rel="L6846"></li>
<li class="L6847" rel="L6847">“FITZWILLIAM DARCY”</li>
<li class="L6848" rel="L6848"></li>
<li class="L6849" rel="L6849"></li>
<li class="L6850" rel="L6850"></li>
<li class="L6851" rel="L6851">Chapter 36</li>
<li class="L6852" rel="L6852"></li>
<li class="L6853" rel="L6853"></li>
<li class="L6854" rel="L6854">If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to</li>
<li class="L6855" rel="L6855">contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of</li>
<li class="L6856" rel="L6856">its contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly</li>
<li class="L6857" rel="L6857">she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.</li>
<li class="L6858" rel="L6858">Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did</li>
<li class="L6859" rel="L6859">she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;</li>
<li class="L6860" rel="L6860">and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation</li>
<li class="L6861" rel="L6861">to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong</li>
<li class="L6862" rel="L6862">prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what</li>
<li class="L6863" rel="L6863">had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly</li>
<li class="L6864" rel="L6864">left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the</li>
<li class="L6865" rel="L6865">next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of</li>
<li class="L6866" rel="L6866">the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister&#39;s insensibility she</li>
<li class="L6867" rel="L6867">instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst</li>
<li class="L6868" rel="L6868">objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing</li>
<li class="L6869" rel="L6869">him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied</li>
<li class="L6870" rel="L6870">her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and</li>
<li class="L6871" rel="L6871">insolence.</li>
<li class="L6872" rel="L6872"></li>
<li class="L6873" rel="L6873">But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when</li>
<li class="L6874" rel="L6874">she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which,</li>
<li class="L6875" rel="L6875">if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which</li>
<li class="L6876" rel="L6876">bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her</li>
<li class="L6877" rel="L6877">feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.</li>
<li class="L6878" rel="L6878">Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished</li>
<li class="L6879" rel="L6879">to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false!</li>
<li class="L6880" rel="L6880">This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!”--and when she had</li>
<li class="L6881" rel="L6881">gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the</li>
<li class="L6882" rel="L6882">last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not</li>
<li class="L6883" rel="L6883">regard it, that she would never look in it again.</li>
<li class="L6884" rel="L6884"></li>
<li class="L6885" rel="L6885">In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on</li>
<li class="L6886" rel="L6886">nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter</li>
<li class="L6887" rel="L6887">was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she</li>
<li class="L6888" rel="L6888">again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and</li>
<li class="L6889" rel="L6889">commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.</li>
<li class="L6890" rel="L6890">The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what</li>
<li class="L6891" rel="L6891">he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though</li>
<li class="L6892" rel="L6892">she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own</li>
<li class="L6893" rel="L6893">words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the</li>
<li class="L6894" rel="L6894">will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living</li>
<li class="L6895" rel="L6895">was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was</li>
<li class="L6896" rel="L6896">impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the</li>
<li class="L6897" rel="L6897">other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did</li>
<li class="L6898" rel="L6898">not err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the</li>
<li class="L6899" rel="L6899">particulars immediately following of Wickham&#39;s resigning all pretensions</li>
<li class="L6900" rel="L6900">to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three</li>
<li class="L6901" rel="L6901">thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down</li>
<li class="L6902" rel="L6902">the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be</li>
<li class="L6903" rel="L6903">impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with</li>
<li class="L6904" rel="L6904">little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read</li>
<li class="L6905" rel="L6905">on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had</li>
<li class="L6906" rel="L6906">believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to</li>
<li class="L6907" rel="L6907">render Mr. Darcy&#39;s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a</li>
<li class="L6908" rel="L6908">turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.</li>
<li class="L6909" rel="L6909"></li>
<li class="L6910" rel="L6910">The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at</li>
<li class="L6911" rel="L6911">Mr. Wickham&#39;s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could</li>
<li class="L6912" rel="L6912">bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his</li>
<li class="L6913" rel="L6913">entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the</li>
<li class="L6914" rel="L6914">persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town,</li>
<li class="L6915" rel="L6915">had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life</li>
<li class="L6916" rel="L6916">nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As</li>
<li class="L6917" rel="L6917">to his real character, had information been in her power, she had</li>
<li class="L6918" rel="L6918">never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had</li>
<li class="L6919" rel="L6919">established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried</li>
<li class="L6920" rel="L6920">to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of</li>
<li class="L6921" rel="L6921">integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of</li>
<li class="L6922" rel="L6922">Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those</li>
<li class="L6923" rel="L6923">casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy</li>
<li class="L6924" rel="L6924">had described as the idleness and vice of many years&#39; continuance. But</li>
<li class="L6925" rel="L6925">no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before</li>
<li class="L6926" rel="L6926">her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more</li>
<li class="L6927" rel="L6927">substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and</li>
<li class="L6928" rel="L6928">the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After</li>
<li class="L6929" rel="L6929">pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to</li>
<li class="L6930" rel="L6930">read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss</li>
<li class="L6931" rel="L6931">Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel</li>
<li class="L6932" rel="L6932">Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was</li>
<li class="L6933" rel="L6933">referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam</li>
<li class="L6934" rel="L6934">himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his</li>
<li class="L6935" rel="L6935">near concern in all his cousin&#39;s affairs, and whose character she had no</li>
<li class="L6936" rel="L6936">reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to</li>
<li class="L6937" rel="L6937">him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and</li>
<li class="L6938" rel="L6938">at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never</li>
<li class="L6939" rel="L6939">have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his</li>
<li class="L6940" rel="L6940">cousin&#39;s corroboration.</li>
<li class="L6941" rel="L6941"></li>
<li class="L6942" rel="L6942">She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation</li>
<li class="L6943" rel="L6943">between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips&#39;s.</li>
<li class="L6944" rel="L6944">Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_</li>
<li class="L6945" rel="L6945">struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and</li>
<li class="L6946" rel="L6946">wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting</li>
<li class="L6947" rel="L6947">himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions</li>
<li class="L6948" rel="L6948">with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear</li>
<li class="L6949" rel="L6949">of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that</li>
<li class="L6950" rel="L6950">_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball</li>
<li class="L6951" rel="L6951">the very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield</li>
<li class="L6952" rel="L6952">family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but</li>
<li class="L6953" rel="L6953">herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed;</li>
<li class="L6954" rel="L6954">that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy&#39;s</li>
<li class="L6955" rel="L6955">character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would</li>
<li class="L6956" rel="L6956">always prevent his exposing the son.</li>
<li class="L6957" rel="L6957"></li>
<li class="L6958" rel="L6958">How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!</li>
<li class="L6959" rel="L6959">His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and</li>
<li class="L6960" rel="L6960">hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer</li>
<li class="L6961" rel="L6961">the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.</li>
<li class="L6962" rel="L6962">His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had</li>
<li class="L6963" rel="L6963">either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying</li>
<li class="L6964" rel="L6964">his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most</li>
<li class="L6965" rel="L6965">incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter</li>
<li class="L6966" rel="L6966">and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not</li>
<li class="L6967" rel="L6967">but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago</li>
<li class="L6968" rel="L6968">asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as</li>
<li class="L6969" rel="L6969">were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their</li>
<li class="L6970" rel="L6970">acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much</li>
<li class="L6971" rel="L6971">together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything</li>
<li class="L6972" rel="L6972">that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him</li>
<li class="L6973" rel="L6973">of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was</li>
<li class="L6974" rel="L6974">esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a</li>
<li class="L6975" rel="L6975">brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his</li>
<li class="L6976" rel="L6976">sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling; that had his</li>
<li class="L6977" rel="L6977">actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of</li>
<li class="L6978" rel="L6978">everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and</li>
<li class="L6979" rel="L6979">that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man</li>
<li class="L6980" rel="L6980">as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.</li>
<li class="L6981" rel="L6981"></li>
<li class="L6982" rel="L6982">She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham</li>
<li class="L6983" rel="L6983">could she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced,</li>
<li class="L6984" rel="L6984">absurd.</li>
<li class="L6985" rel="L6985"></li>
<li class="L6986" rel="L6986">“How despicably I have acted!” she cried; “I, who have prided myself</li>
<li class="L6987" rel="L6987">on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have</li>
<li class="L6988" rel="L6988">often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified</li>
<li class="L6989" rel="L6989">my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this</li>
<li class="L6990" rel="L6990">discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could</li>
<li class="L6991" rel="L6991">not have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my</li>
<li class="L6992" rel="L6992">folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect</li>
<li class="L6993" rel="L6993">of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted</li>
<li class="L6994" rel="L6994">prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were</li>
<li class="L6995" rel="L6995">concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.”</li>
<li class="L6996" rel="L6996"></li>
<li class="L6997" rel="L6997">From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line</li>
<li class="L6998" rel="L6998">which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy&#39;s explanation</li>
<li class="L6999" rel="L6999">_there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely</li>
<li class="L7000" rel="L7000">different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that</li>
<li class="L7001" rel="L7001">credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to</li>
<li class="L7002" rel="L7002">give in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her</li>
<li class="L7003" rel="L7003">sister&#39;s attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte&#39;s</li>
<li class="L7004" rel="L7004">opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his</li>
<li class="L7005" rel="L7005">description of Jane. She felt that Jane&#39;s feelings, though fervent, were</li>
<li class="L7006" rel="L7006">little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air</li>
<li class="L7007" rel="L7007">and manner not often united with great sensibility.</li>
<li class="L7008" rel="L7008"></li>
<li class="L7009" rel="L7009">When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were</li>
<li class="L7010" rel="L7010">mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense</li>
<li class="L7011" rel="L7011">of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly</li>
<li class="L7012" rel="L7012">for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as</li>
<li class="L7013" rel="L7013">having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first</li>
<li class="L7014" rel="L7014">disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind</li>
<li class="L7015" rel="L7015">than on hers.</li>
<li class="L7016" rel="L7016"></li>
<li class="L7017" rel="L7017">The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed,</li>
<li class="L7018" rel="L7018">but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been</li>
<li class="L7019" rel="L7019">self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered</li>
<li class="L7020" rel="L7020">that Jane&#39;s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest</li>
<li class="L7021" rel="L7021">relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt</li>
<li class="L7022" rel="L7022">by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she</li>
<li class="L7023" rel="L7023">had ever known before.</li>
<li class="L7024" rel="L7024"></li>
<li class="L7025" rel="L7025">After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every</li>
<li class="L7026" rel="L7026">variety of thought--re-considering events, determining probabilities,</li>
<li class="L7027" rel="L7027">and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and</li>
<li class="L7028" rel="L7028">so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made</li>
<li class="L7029" rel="L7029">her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish</li>
<li class="L7030" rel="L7030">of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such</li>
<li class="L7031" rel="L7031">reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.</li>
<li class="L7032" rel="L7032"></li>
<li class="L7033" rel="L7033">She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each</li>
<li class="L7034" rel="L7034">called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take</li>
<li class="L7035" rel="L7035">leave--but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least</li>
<li class="L7036" rel="L7036">an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her</li>
<li class="L7037" rel="L7037">till she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern</li>
<li class="L7038" rel="L7038">in missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no</li>
<li class="L7039" rel="L7039">longer an object; she could think only of her letter.</li>
<li class="L7040" rel="L7040"></li>

<li class="L7042" rel="L7042"></li>
<li class="L7043" rel="L7043">Chapter 37</li>
<li class="L7044" rel="L7044"></li>
<li class="L7045" rel="L7045"></li>
<li class="L7046" rel="L7046">The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having</li>
<li class="L7047" rel="L7047">been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was</li>
<li class="L7048" rel="L7048">able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very</li>
<li class="L7049" rel="L7049">good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the</li>
<li class="L7050" rel="L7050">melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then</li>
<li class="L7051" rel="L7051">hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return</li>
<li class="L7052" rel="L7052">brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,</li>
<li class="L7053" rel="L7053">importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of</li>
<li class="L7054" rel="L7054">having them all to dine with her.</li>
<li class="L7055" rel="L7055"></li>
<li class="L7056" rel="L7056">Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had</li>
<li class="L7057" rel="L7057">she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as</li>
<li class="L7058" rel="L7058">her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her</li>
<li class="L7059" rel="L7059">ladyship&#39;s indignation would have been. “What would she have said? how</li>
<li class="L7060" rel="L7060">would she have behaved?” were questions with which she amused herself.</li>
<li class="L7061" rel="L7061"></li>
<li class="L7062" rel="L7062">Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. “I assure</li>
<li class="L7063" rel="L7063">you, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I believe no one</li>
<li class="L7064" rel="L7064">feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly</li>
<li class="L7065" rel="L7065">attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to</li>
<li class="L7066" rel="L7066">me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The</li>
<li class="L7067" rel="L7067">dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy</li>
<li class="L7068" rel="L7068">seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. His</li>
<li class="L7069" rel="L7069">attachment to Rosings certainly increases.”</li>
<li class="L7070" rel="L7070"></li>
<li class="L7071" rel="L7071">Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which</li>
<li class="L7072" rel="L7072">were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.</li>
<li class="L7073" rel="L7073"></li>
<li class="L7074" rel="L7074">Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of</li>
<li class="L7075" rel="L7075">spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that</li>
<li class="L7076" rel="L7076">she did not like to go home again so soon, she added:</li>
<li class="L7077" rel="L7077"></li>
<li class="L7078" rel="L7078">“But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that</li>
<li class="L7079" rel="L7079">you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your</li>
<li class="L7080" rel="L7080">company, I am sure.”</li>
<li class="L7081" rel="L7081"></li>
<li class="L7082" rel="L7082">“I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,” replied</li>
<li class="L7083" rel="L7083">Elizabeth, “but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town</li>
<li class="L7084" rel="L7084">next Saturday.”</li>
<li class="L7085" rel="L7085"></li>
<li class="L7086" rel="L7086">“Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected</li>
<li class="L7087" rel="L7087">you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There</li>
<li class="L7088" rel="L7088">can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly</li>
<li class="L7089" rel="L7089">spare you for another fortnight.”</li>
<li class="L7090" rel="L7090"></li>
<li class="L7091" rel="L7091">“But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.”</li>
<li class="L7092" rel="L7092"></li>
<li class="L7093" rel="L7093">“Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters</li>
<li class="L7094" rel="L7094">are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay</li>
<li class="L7095" rel="L7095">another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as</li>
<li class="L7096" rel="L7096">far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as</li>
<li class="L7097" rel="L7097">Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room</li>
<li class="L7098" rel="L7098">for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I</li>
<li class="L7099" rel="L7099">should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.”</li>
<li class="L7100" rel="L7100"></li>
<li class="L7101" rel="L7101">“You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our</li>
<li class="L7102" rel="L7102">original plan.”</li>
<li class="L7103" rel="L7103"></li>
<li class="L7104" rel="L7104">Lady Catherine seemed resigned. “Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant</li>
<li class="L7105" rel="L7105">with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea</li>
<li class="L7106" rel="L7106">of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.</li>
<li class="L7107" rel="L7107">You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in</li>
<li class="L7108" rel="L7108">the world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly</li>
<li class="L7109" rel="L7109">guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my</li>
<li class="L7110" rel="L7110">niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her</li>
<li class="L7111" rel="L7111">having two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of</li>
<li class="L7112" rel="L7112">Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with</li>
<li class="L7113" rel="L7113">propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those</li>
<li class="L7114" rel="L7114">things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I</li>
<li class="L7115" rel="L7115">am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be</li>
<li class="L7116" rel="L7116">discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.”</li>
<li class="L7117" rel="L7117"></li>
<li class="L7118" rel="L7118">“My uncle is to send a servant for us.”</li>
<li class="L7119" rel="L7119"></li>
<li class="L7120" rel="L7120">“Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you</li>
<li class="L7121" rel="L7121">have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses?</li>
<li class="L7122" rel="L7122">Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be</li>
<li class="L7123" rel="L7123">attended to.”</li>
<li class="L7124" rel="L7124"></li>
<li class="L7125" rel="L7125">Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,</li>
<li class="L7126" rel="L7126">and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,</li>
<li class="L7127" rel="L7127">which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so</li>
<li class="L7128" rel="L7128">occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be</li>
<li class="L7129" rel="L7129">reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it</li>
<li class="L7130" rel="L7130">as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary</li>
<li class="L7131" rel="L7131">walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant</li>
<li class="L7132" rel="L7132">recollections.</li>
<li class="L7133" rel="L7133"></li>
<li class="L7134" rel="L7134">Mr. Darcy&#39;s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She</li>
<li class="L7135" rel="L7135">studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at</li>
<li class="L7136" rel="L7136">times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,</li>
<li class="L7137" rel="L7137">she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly</li>
<li class="L7138" rel="L7138">she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against</li>
<li class="L7139" rel="L7139">herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.</li>
<li class="L7140" rel="L7140">His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she</li>
<li class="L7141" rel="L7141">could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal,</li>
<li class="L7142" rel="L7142">or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past</li>
<li class="L7143" rel="L7143">behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in</li>
<li class="L7144" rel="L7144">the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.</li>
<li class="L7145" rel="L7145">They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at</li>
<li class="L7146" rel="L7146">them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his</li>
<li class="L7147" rel="L7147">youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right</li>
<li class="L7148" rel="L7148">herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently</li>
<li class="L7149" rel="L7149">united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine</li>
<li class="L7150" rel="L7150">and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother&#39;s indulgence,</li>
<li class="L7151" rel="L7151">what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,</li>
<li class="L7152" rel="L7152">irritable, and completely under Lydia&#39;s guidance, had been always</li>
<li class="L7153" rel="L7153">affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would</li>
<li class="L7154" rel="L7154">scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While</li>
<li class="L7155" rel="L7155">there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while</li>
<li class="L7156" rel="L7156">Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there</li>
<li class="L7157" rel="L7157">forever.</li>
<li class="L7158" rel="L7158"></li>
<li class="L7159" rel="L7159">Anxiety on Jane&#39;s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy&#39;s</li>
<li class="L7160" rel="L7160">explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,</li>
<li class="L7161" rel="L7161">heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved</li>
<li class="L7162" rel="L7162">to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any</li>
<li class="L7163" rel="L7163">could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How</li>
<li class="L7164" rel="L7164">grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every</li>
<li class="L7165" rel="L7165">respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had</li>
<li class="L7166" rel="L7166">been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!</li>
<li class="L7167" rel="L7167"></li>
<li class="L7168" rel="L7168">When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham&#39;s</li>
<li class="L7169" rel="L7169">character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had</li>
<li class="L7170" rel="L7170">seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it</li>
<li class="L7171" rel="L7171">almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.</li>
<li class="L7172" rel="L7172"></li>
<li class="L7173" rel="L7173">Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of</li>
<li class="L7174" rel="L7174">her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent</li>
<li class="L7175" rel="L7175">there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of</li>
<li class="L7176" rel="L7176">their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,</li>
<li class="L7177" rel="L7177">and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right</li>
<li class="L7178" rel="L7178">way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the</li>
<li class="L7179" rel="L7179">work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.</li>
<li class="L7180" rel="L7180"></li>
<li class="L7181" rel="L7181">When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them</li>
<li class="L7182" rel="L7182">a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;</li>
<li class="L7183" rel="L7183">and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her</li>
<li class="L7184" rel="L7184">hand to both.</li>
<li class="L7185" rel="L7185"></li>
<li class="L7186" rel="L7186"></li>

<li class="L7189" rel="L7189"></li>
<li class="L7190" rel="L7190"></li>
<li class="L7191" rel="L7191">On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few</li>
<li class="L7192" rel="L7192">minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of</li>
<li class="L7193" rel="L7193">paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.</li>
<li class="L7194" rel="L7194"></li>
<li class="L7195" rel="L7195">“I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether Mrs. Collins has yet</li>
<li class="L7196" rel="L7196">expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very</li>
<li class="L7197" rel="L7197">certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for</li>
<li class="L7198" rel="L7198">it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We</li>
<li class="L7199" rel="L7199">know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain</li>
<li class="L7200" rel="L7200">manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we</li>
<li class="L7201" rel="L7201">see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like</li>
<li class="L7202" rel="L7202">yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,</li>
<li class="L7203" rel="L7203">and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending</li>
<li class="L7204" rel="L7204">your time unpleasantly.”</li>
<li class="L7205" rel="L7205"></li>
<li class="L7206" rel="L7206">Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She</li>
<li class="L7207" rel="L7207">had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with</li>
<li class="L7208" rel="L7208">Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_</li>
<li class="L7209" rel="L7209">feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling</li>
<li class="L7210" rel="L7210">solemnity replied:</li>
<li class="L7211" rel="L7211"></li>
<li class="L7212" rel="L7212">“It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not</li>
<li class="L7213" rel="L7213">disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately</li>
<li class="L7214" rel="L7214">having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and,</li>
<li class="L7215" rel="L7215">from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the</li>
<li class="L7216" rel="L7216">humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford</li>
<li class="L7217" rel="L7217">visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to</li>
<li class="L7218" rel="L7218">Lady Catherine&#39;s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage</li>
<li class="L7219" rel="L7219">and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You</li>
<li class="L7220" rel="L7220">see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge</li>
<li class="L7221" rel="L7221">that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should</li>
<li class="L7222" rel="L7222">not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are</li>
<li class="L7223" rel="L7223">sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.”</li>
<li class="L7224" rel="L7224"></li>
<li class="L7225" rel="L7225">Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was</li>
<li class="L7226" rel="L7226">obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility</li>
<li class="L7227" rel="L7227">and truth in a few short sentences.</li>
<li class="L7228" rel="L7228"></li>
<li class="L7229" rel="L7229">“You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into</li>
<li class="L7230" rel="L7230">Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will</li>
<li class="L7231" rel="L7231">be able to do so. Lady Catherine&#39;s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you</li>
<li class="L7232" rel="L7232">have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear</li>
<li class="L7233" rel="L7233">that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be</li>
<li class="L7234" rel="L7234">as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,</li>
<li class="L7235" rel="L7235">that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in</li>
<li class="L7236" rel="L7236">marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of</li>
<li class="L7237" rel="L7237">thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of</li>
<li class="L7238" rel="L7238">character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each</li>
<li class="L7239" rel="L7239">other.”</li>
<li class="L7240" rel="L7240"></li>
<li class="L7241" rel="L7241">Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was</li>
<li class="L7242" rel="L7242">the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed</li>
<li class="L7243" rel="L7243">and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to</li>
<li class="L7244" rel="L7244">have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang.</li>
<li class="L7245" rel="L7245">Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she</li>
<li class="L7246" rel="L7246">had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that</li>
<li class="L7247" rel="L7247">her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her</li>
<li class="L7248" rel="L7248">home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their</li>
<li class="L7249" rel="L7249">dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.</li>
<li class="L7250" rel="L7250"></li>
<li class="L7251" rel="L7251">At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels</li>
<li class="L7252" rel="L7252">placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate</li>
<li class="L7253" rel="L7253">parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by</li>
<li class="L7254" rel="L7254">Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her</li>
<li class="L7255" rel="L7255">with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks</li>
<li class="L7256" rel="L7256">for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his</li>
<li class="L7257" rel="L7257">compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her</li>
<li class="L7258" rel="L7258">in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,</li>
<li class="L7259" rel="L7259">when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had</li>
<li class="L7260" rel="L7260">hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.</li>
<li class="L7261" rel="L7261"></li>
<li class="L7262" rel="L7262">“But,” he added, “you will of course wish to have your humble respects</li>
<li class="L7263" rel="L7263">delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you</li>
<li class="L7264" rel="L7264">while you have been here.”</li>
<li class="L7265" rel="L7265"></li>
<li class="L7266" rel="L7266">Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and</li>
<li class="L7267" rel="L7267">the carriage drove off.</li>
<li class="L7268" rel="L7268"></li>
<li class="L7269" rel="L7269">“Good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes&#39; silence, “it seems</li>
<li class="L7270" rel="L7270">but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have</li>
<li class="L7271" rel="L7271">happened!”</li>
<li class="L7272" rel="L7272"></li>
<li class="L7273" rel="L7273">“A great many indeed,” said her companion with a sigh.</li>
<li class="L7274" rel="L7274"></li>
<li class="L7275" rel="L7275">“We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!</li>
<li class="L7276" rel="L7276">How much I shall have to tell!”</li>
<li class="L7277" rel="L7277"></li>
<li class="L7278" rel="L7278">Elizabeth added privately, “And how much I shall have to conceal!”</li>
<li class="L7279" rel="L7279"></li>
<li class="L7280" rel="L7280">Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and</li>
<li class="L7281" rel="L7281">within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner&#39;s</li>
<li class="L7282" rel="L7282">house, where they were to remain a few days.</li>
<li class="L7283" rel="L7283"></li>
<li class="L7284" rel="L7284">Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her</li>
<li class="L7285" rel="L7285">spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her</li>
<li class="L7286" rel="L7286">aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at</li>
<li class="L7287" rel="L7287">Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.</li>
<li class="L7288" rel="L7288"></li>
<li class="L7289" rel="L7289">It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for</li>
<li class="L7290" rel="L7290">Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy&#39;s proposals. To know</li>
<li class="L7291" rel="L7291">that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish</li>
<li class="L7292" rel="L7292">Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own</li>
<li class="L7293" rel="L7293">vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation</li>
<li class="L7294" rel="L7294">to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision</li>
<li class="L7295" rel="L7295">in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate;</li>
<li class="L7296" rel="L7296">and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried</li>
<li class="L7297" rel="L7297">into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister</li>
<li class="L7298" rel="L7298">further.</li>

<li class="L7300" rel="L7300"></li>

<li class="L7302" rel="L7302">Chapter 39</li>
<li class="L7303" rel="L7303"></li>
<li class="L7304" rel="L7304"></li>
<li class="L7305" rel="L7305">It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out</li>
<li class="L7306" rel="L7306">together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;</li>
<li class="L7307" rel="L7307">and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet&#39;s carriage</li>
<li class="L7308" rel="L7308">was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman&#39;s</li>
<li class="L7309" rel="L7309">punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.</li>
<li class="L7310" rel="L7310">These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed</li>
<li class="L7311" rel="L7311">in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and</li>
<li class="L7312" rel="L7312">dressing a salad and cucumber.</li>
<li class="L7313" rel="L7313"></li>
<li class="L7314" rel="L7314">After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set</li>
<li class="L7315" rel="L7315">out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,</li>
<li class="L7316" rel="L7316">“Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?”</li>
<li class="L7317" rel="L7317"></li>
<li class="L7318" rel="L7318">“And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia, “but you must lend us the</li>
<li class="L7319" rel="L7319">money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” Then, showing</li>
<li class="L7320" rel="L7320">her purchases--“Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think</li>
<li class="L7321" rel="L7321">it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall</li>
<li class="L7322" rel="L7322">pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any</li>
<li class="L7323" rel="L7323">better.”</li>
<li class="L7324" rel="L7324"></li>
<li class="L7325" rel="L7325">And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect</li>
<li class="L7326" rel="L7326">unconcern, “Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and</li>
<li class="L7327" rel="L7327">when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I</li>
<li class="L7328" rel="L7328">think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what</li>
<li class="L7329" rel="L7329">one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they</li>
<li class="L7330" rel="L7330">are going in a fortnight.”</li>
<li class="L7331" rel="L7331"></li>
<li class="L7332" rel="L7332">“Are they indeed!” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.</li>
<li class="L7333" rel="L7333"></li>
<li class="L7334" rel="L7334">“They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to</li>
<li class="L7335" rel="L7335">take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme;</li>
<li class="L7336" rel="L7336">and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to</li>
<li class="L7337" rel="L7337">go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall</li>
<li class="L7338" rel="L7338">have!”</li>
<li class="L7339" rel="L7339"></li>
<li class="L7340" rel="L7340">“Yes,” thought Elizabeth, “_that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed,</li>
<li class="L7341" rel="L7341">and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole</li>
<li class="L7342" rel="L7342">campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor</li>
<li class="L7343" rel="L7343">regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!”</li>
<li class="L7344" rel="L7344"></li>
<li class="L7345" rel="L7345">“Now I have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down at</li>
<li class="L7346" rel="L7346">table. “What do you think? It is excellent news--capital news--and about</li>
<li class="L7347" rel="L7347">a certain person we all like!”</li>
<li class="L7348" rel="L7348"></li>
<li class="L7349" rel="L7349">Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need</li>
<li class="L7350" rel="L7350">not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:</li>
<li class="L7351" rel="L7351"></li>
<li class="L7352" rel="L7352">“Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the</li>
<li class="L7353" rel="L7353">waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse</li>
<li class="L7354" rel="L7354">things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad</li>
<li class="L7355" rel="L7355">he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for</li>
<li class="L7356" rel="L7356">my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?</li>
<li class="L7357" rel="L7357">There is no danger of Wickham&#39;s marrying Mary King. There&#39;s for you! She</li>
<li class="L7358" rel="L7358">is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.”</li>
<li class="L7359" rel="L7359"></li>
<li class="L7360" rel="L7360">“And Mary King is safe!” added Elizabeth; “safe from a connection</li>
<li class="L7361" rel="L7361">imprudent as to fortune.”</li>
<li class="L7362" rel="L7362"></li>
<li class="L7363" rel="L7363">“She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.”</li>
<li class="L7364" rel="L7364"></li>
<li class="L7365" rel="L7365">“But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said Jane.</li>
<li class="L7366" rel="L7366"></li>
<li class="L7367" rel="L7367">“I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never cared</li>
<li class="L7368" rel="L7368">three straws about her--who could about such a nasty little freckled</li>
<li class="L7369" rel="L7369">thing?”</li>
<li class="L7370" rel="L7370"></li>
<li class="L7371" rel="L7371">Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such</li>
<li class="L7372" rel="L7372">coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_</li>
<li class="L7373" rel="L7373">was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!</li>
<li class="L7374" rel="L7374"></li>
<li class="L7375" rel="L7375">As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was</li>
<li class="L7376" rel="L7376">ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their</li>
<li class="L7377" rel="L7377">boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty&#39;s and</li>
<li class="L7378" rel="L7378">Lydia&#39;s purchases, were seated in it.</li>
<li class="L7379" rel="L7379"></li>
<li class="L7380" rel="L7380">“How nicely we are all crammed in,” cried Lydia. “I am glad I bought my</li>
<li class="L7381" rel="L7381">bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now</li>
<li class="L7382" rel="L7382">let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way</li>
<li class="L7383" rel="L7383">home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all</li>
<li class="L7384" rel="L7384">since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any</li>
<li class="L7385" rel="L7385">flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband</li>
<li class="L7386" rel="L7386">before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.</li>
<li class="L7387" rel="L7387">She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not</li>
<li class="L7388" rel="L7388">being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to</li>
<li class="L7389" rel="L7389">get husbands, you can&#39;t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.</li>
<li class="L7390" rel="L7390">Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!</li>
<li class="L7391" rel="L7391">how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would</li>
<li class="L7392" rel="L7392">chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece</li>
<li class="L7393" rel="L7393">of fun the other day at Colonel Forster&#39;s. Kitty and me were to spend</li>
<li class="L7394" rel="L7394">the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the</li>
<li class="L7395" rel="L7395">evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so</li>
<li class="L7396" rel="L7396">she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen</li>
<li class="L7397" rel="L7397">was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We</li>
<li class="L7398" rel="L7398">dressed up Chamberlayne in woman&#39;s clothes on purpose to pass for a</li>
<li class="L7399" rel="L7399">lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.</li>
<li class="L7400" rel="L7400">Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow</li>
<li class="L7401" rel="L7401">one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,</li>
<li class="L7402" rel="L7402">and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they</li>
<li class="L7403" rel="L7403">did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.</li>
<li class="L7404" rel="L7404">Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect</li>
<li class="L7405" rel="L7405">something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.”</li>
<li class="L7406" rel="L7406"></li>
<li class="L7407" rel="L7407">With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did</li>
<li class="L7408" rel="L7408">Lydia, assisted by Kitty&#39;s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her</li>
<li class="L7409" rel="L7409">companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she</li>
<li class="L7410" rel="L7410">could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham&#39;s name.</li>
<li class="L7411" rel="L7411"></li>
<li class="L7412" rel="L7412">Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane</li>
<li class="L7413" rel="L7413">in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet</li>
<li class="L7414" rel="L7414">say voluntarily to Elizabeth:</li>
<li class="L7415" rel="L7415"></li>
<li class="L7416" rel="L7416">“I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.”</li>
<li class="L7417" rel="L7417"></li>
<li class="L7418" rel="L7418">Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases</li>
<li class="L7419" rel="L7419">came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that</li>
<li class="L7420" rel="L7420">occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and</li>
<li class="L7421" rel="L7421">poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one</li>
<li class="L7422" rel="L7422">hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat</li>
<li class="L7423" rel="L7423">some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger</li>
<li class="L7424" rel="L7424">Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person&#39;s,</li>
<li class="L7425" rel="L7425">was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who</li>
<li class="L7426" rel="L7426">would hear her.</li>
<li class="L7427" rel="L7427"></li>
<li class="L7428" rel="L7428">“Oh! Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!</li>
<li class="L7429" rel="L7429">As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there</li>
<li class="L7430" rel="L7430">was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty</li>
<li class="L7431" rel="L7431">had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved</li>
<li class="L7432" rel="L7432">very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold</li>
<li class="L7433" rel="L7433">luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated</li>
<li class="L7434" rel="L7434">you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never</li>
<li class="L7435" rel="L7435">should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then</li>
<li class="L7436" rel="L7436">we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that</li>
<li class="L7437" rel="L7437">anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”</li>
<li class="L7438" rel="L7438"></li>
<li class="L7439" rel="L7439">To this Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear sister,</li>
<li class="L7440" rel="L7440">to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the</li>
<li class="L7441" rel="L7441">generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for</li>
<li class="L7442" rel="L7442">_me_--I should infinitely prefer a book.”</li>
<li class="L7443" rel="L7443"></li>
<li class="L7444" rel="L7444">But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to</li>
<li class="L7445" rel="L7445">anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.</li>
<li class="L7446" rel="L7446"></li>
<li class="L7447" rel="L7447">In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk</li>
<li class="L7448" rel="L7448">to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily</li>
<li class="L7449" rel="L7449">opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could</li>
<li class="L7450" rel="L7450">not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.</li>
<li class="L7451" rel="L7451">There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr.</li>
<li class="L7452" rel="L7452">Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The</li>
<li class="L7453" rel="L7453">comfort to _her_ of the regiment&#39;s approaching removal was indeed beyond</li>
<li class="L7454" rel="L7454">expression. In a fortnight they were to go--and once gone, she hoped</li>
<li class="L7455" rel="L7455">there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.</li>
<li class="L7456" rel="L7456"></li>
<li class="L7457" rel="L7457">She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton</li>
<li class="L7458" rel="L7458">scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under</li>
<li class="L7459" rel="L7459">frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her</li>
<li class="L7460" rel="L7460">father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were</li>
<li class="L7461" rel="L7461">at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often</li>
<li class="L7462" rel="L7462">disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.</li>
<li class="L7463" rel="L7463"></li>
<li class="L7464" rel="L7464"></li>

<li class="L7467" rel="L7467"></li>
<li class="L7468" rel="L7468"></li>
<li class="L7469" rel="L7469">Elizabeth&#39;s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could</li>
<li class="L7470" rel="L7470">no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every</li>
<li class="L7471" rel="L7471">particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be</li>
<li class="L7472" rel="L7472">surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene</li>
<li class="L7473" rel="L7473">between Mr. Darcy and herself.</li>
<li class="L7474" rel="L7474"></li>
<li class="L7475" rel="L7475">Miss Bennet&#39;s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly</li>
<li class="L7476" rel="L7476">partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly</li>
<li class="L7477" rel="L7477">natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was</li>
<li class="L7478" rel="L7478">sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so</li>
<li class="L7479" rel="L7479">little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the</li>
<li class="L7480" rel="L7480">unhappiness which her sister&#39;s refusal must have given him.</li>
<li class="L7481" rel="L7481"></li>
<li class="L7482" rel="L7482">“His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly</li>
<li class="L7483" rel="L7483">ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his</li>
<li class="L7484" rel="L7484">disappointment!”</li>
<li class="L7485" rel="L7485"></li>
<li class="L7486" rel="L7486">“Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has</li>
<li class="L7487" rel="L7487">other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.</li>
<li class="L7488" rel="L7488">You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”</li>
<li class="L7489" rel="L7489"></li>
<li class="L7490" rel="L7490">“Blame you! Oh, no.”</li>
<li class="L7491" rel="L7491"></li>
<li class="L7492" rel="L7492">“But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”</li>
<li class="L7493" rel="L7493"></li>
<li class="L7494" rel="L7494">“No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”</li>
<li class="L7495" rel="L7495"></li>
<li class="L7496" rel="L7496">“But you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very next</li>
<li class="L7497" rel="L7497">day.”</li>
<li class="L7498" rel="L7498"></li>
<li class="L7499" rel="L7499">She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far</li>
<li class="L7500" rel="L7500">as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane!</li>
<li class="L7501" rel="L7501">who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that</li>
<li class="L7502" rel="L7502">so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here</li>
<li class="L7503" rel="L7503">collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy&#39;s vindication, though</li>
<li class="L7504" rel="L7504">grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.</li>
<li class="L7505" rel="L7505">Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and</li>
<li class="L7506" rel="L7506">seek to clear the one without involving the other.</li>
<li class="L7507" rel="L7507"></li>
<li class="L7508" rel="L7508">“This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both</li>
<li class="L7509" rel="L7509">of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied</li>
<li class="L7510" rel="L7510">with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just</li>
<li class="L7511" rel="L7511">enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting</li>
<li class="L7512" rel="L7512">about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy&#39;s;</li>
<li class="L7513" rel="L7513">but you shall do as you choose.”</li>
<li class="L7514" rel="L7514"></li>
<li class="L7515" rel="L7515">It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.</li>
<li class="L7516" rel="L7516"></li>
<li class="L7517" rel="L7517">“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham so</li>
<li class="L7518" rel="L7518">very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only</li>
<li class="L7519" rel="L7519">consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the</li>
<li class="L7520" rel="L7520">knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing</li>
<li class="L7521" rel="L7521">of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it</li>
<li class="L7522" rel="L7522">so.”</li>
<li class="L7523" rel="L7523"></li>
<li class="L7524" rel="L7524">“Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so</li>
<li class="L7525" rel="L7525">full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am</li>
<li class="L7526" rel="L7526">growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion</li>
<li class="L7527" rel="L7527">makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will</li>
<li class="L7528" rel="L7528">be as light as a feather.”</li>
<li class="L7529" rel="L7529"></li>
<li class="L7530" rel="L7530">“Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his</li>
<li class="L7531" rel="L7531">countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!”</li>
<li class="L7532" rel="L7532"></li>
<li class="L7533" rel="L7533">“There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those</li>
<li class="L7534" rel="L7534">two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the</li>
<li class="L7535" rel="L7535">appearance of it.”</li>
<li class="L7536" rel="L7536"></li>
<li class="L7537" rel="L7537">“I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you</li>
<li class="L7538" rel="L7538">used to do.”</li>
<li class="L7539" rel="L7539"></li>
<li class="L7540" rel="L7540">“And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike</li>
<li class="L7541" rel="L7541">to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one&#39;s genius, such an</li>
<li class="L7542" rel="L7542">opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually</li>
<li class="L7543" rel="L7543">abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing</li>
<li class="L7544" rel="L7544">at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.”</li>
<li class="L7545" rel="L7545"></li>
<li class="L7546" rel="L7546">“Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat</li>
<li class="L7547" rel="L7547">the matter as you do now.”</li>
<li class="L7548" rel="L7548"></li>
<li class="L7549" rel="L7549">“Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And</li>
<li class="L7550" rel="L7550">with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say</li>
<li class="L7551" rel="L7551">that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I</li>
<li class="L7552" rel="L7552">had! Oh! how I wanted you!”</li>
<li class="L7553" rel="L7553"></li>
<li class="L7554" rel="L7554">“How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions</li>
<li class="L7555" rel="L7555">in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly</li>
<li class="L7556" rel="L7556">undeserved.”</li>
<li class="L7557" rel="L7557"></li>
<li class="L7558" rel="L7558">“Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most</li>
<li class="L7559" rel="L7559">natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There</li>
<li class="L7560" rel="L7560">is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I</li>
<li class="L7561" rel="L7561">ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand</li>
<li class="L7562" rel="L7562">Wickham&#39;s character.”</li>
<li class="L7563" rel="L7563"></li>
<li class="L7564" rel="L7564">Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can be no</li>
<li class="L7565" rel="L7565">occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?”</li>
<li class="L7566" rel="L7566"></li>
<li class="L7567" rel="L7567">“That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me</li>
<li class="L7568" rel="L7568">to make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular</li>
<li class="L7569" rel="L7569">relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to</li>
<li class="L7570" rel="L7570">myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his</li>
<li class="L7571" rel="L7571">conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy</li>
<li class="L7572" rel="L7572">is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in</li>
<li class="L7573" rel="L7573">Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal</li>
<li class="L7574" rel="L7574">to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to</li>
<li class="L7575" rel="L7575">anyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out,</li>
<li class="L7576" rel="L7576">and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At</li>
<li class="L7577" rel="L7577">present I will say nothing about it.”</li>
<li class="L7578" rel="L7578"></li>
<li class="L7579" rel="L7579">“You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for</li>
<li class="L7580" rel="L7580">ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to</li>
<li class="L7581" rel="L7581">re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.”</li>
<li class="L7582" rel="L7582"></li>
<li class="L7583" rel="L7583">The tumult of Elizabeth&#39;s mind was allayed by this conversation. She had</li>
<li class="L7584" rel="L7584">got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,</li>
<li class="L7585" rel="L7585">and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish</li>
<li class="L7586" rel="L7586">to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind,</li>
<li class="L7587" rel="L7587">of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other</li>
<li class="L7588" rel="L7588">half of Mr. Darcy&#39;s letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she</li>
<li class="L7589" rel="L7589">had been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one</li>
<li class="L7590" rel="L7590">could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect</li>
<li class="L7591" rel="L7591">understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off</li>
<li class="L7592" rel="L7592">this last encumbrance of mystery. “And then,” said she, “if that very</li>
<li class="L7593" rel="L7593">improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to</li>
<li class="L7594" rel="L7594">tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The</li>
<li class="L7595" rel="L7595">liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!”</li>
<li class="L7596" rel="L7596"></li>
<li class="L7597" rel="L7597">She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real</li>
<li class="L7598" rel="L7598">state of her sister&#39;s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a</li>
<li class="L7599" rel="L7599">very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself</li>
<li class="L7600" rel="L7600">in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment,</li>
<li class="L7601" rel="L7601">and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first</li>
<li class="L7602" rel="L7602">attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance,</li>
<li class="L7603" rel="L7603">and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her</li>
<li class="L7604" rel="L7604">attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the</li>
<li class="L7605" rel="L7605">indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own</li>
<li class="L7606" rel="L7606">health and their tranquillity.</li>
<li class="L7607" rel="L7607"></li>
<li class="L7608" rel="L7608">“Well, Lizzy,” said Mrs. Bennet one day, “what is your opinion _now_ of</li>
<li class="L7609" rel="L7609">this sad business of Jane&#39;s? For my part, I am determined never to speak</li>
<li class="L7610" rel="L7610">of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But</li>
<li class="L7611" rel="L7611">I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is</li>
<li class="L7612" rel="L7612">a very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there&#39;s the least</li>
<li class="L7613" rel="L7613">chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of</li>
<li class="L7614" rel="L7614">his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of</li>
<li class="L7615" rel="L7615">everybody, too, who is likely to know.”</li>
<li class="L7616" rel="L7616"></li>
<li class="L7617" rel="L7617">“I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.”</li>
<li class="L7618" rel="L7618"></li>
<li class="L7619" rel="L7619">“Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I</li>
<li class="L7620" rel="L7620">shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I</li>
<li class="L7621" rel="L7621">would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will</li>
<li class="L7622" rel="L7622">die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.”</li>
<li class="L7623" rel="L7623"></li>
<li class="L7624" rel="L7624">But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,</li>
<li class="L7625" rel="L7625">she made no answer.</li>
<li class="L7626" rel="L7626"></li>
<li class="L7627" rel="L7627">“Well, Lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the</li>
<li class="L7628" rel="L7628">Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope</li>
<li class="L7629" rel="L7629">it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an</li>
<li class="L7630" rel="L7630">excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her</li>
<li class="L7631" rel="L7631">mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_</li>
<li class="L7632" rel="L7632">housekeeping, I dare say.”</li>
<li class="L7633" rel="L7633"></li>
<li class="L7634" rel="L7634">“No, nothing at all.”</li>
<li class="L7635" rel="L7635"></li>
<li class="L7636" rel="L7636">“A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes, _they_ will</li>
<li class="L7637" rel="L7637">take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed</li>
<li class="L7638" rel="L7638">for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often</li>
<li class="L7639" rel="L7639">talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as</li>
<li class="L7640" rel="L7640">quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.”</li>
<li class="L7641" rel="L7641"></li>
<li class="L7642" rel="L7642">“It was a subject which they could not mention before me.”</li>
<li class="L7643" rel="L7643"></li>
<li class="L7644" rel="L7644">“No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they</li>
<li class="L7645" rel="L7645">often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an</li>
<li class="L7646" rel="L7646">estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be</li>
<li class="L7647" rel="L7647">ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.”</li>
<li class="L7648" rel="L7648"></li>
<li class="L7649" rel="L7649"></li>

<li class="L7653" rel="L7653"></li>
<li class="L7654" rel="L7654">The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was</li>
<li class="L7655" rel="L7655">the last of the regiment&#39;s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies</li>
<li class="L7656" rel="L7656">in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost</li>
<li class="L7657" rel="L7657">universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,</li>
<li class="L7658" rel="L7658">and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very</li>
<li class="L7659" rel="L7659">frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and</li>
<li class="L7660" rel="L7660">Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such</li>
<li class="L7661" rel="L7661">hard-heartedness in any of the family.</li>
<li class="L7662" rel="L7662"></li>
<li class="L7663" rel="L7663">“Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?” would they</li>
<li class="L7664" rel="L7664">often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “How can you be smiling so,</li>
<li class="L7665" rel="L7665">Lizzy?”</li>
<li class="L7666" rel="L7666"></li>
<li class="L7667" rel="L7667">Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what</li>
<li class="L7668" rel="L7668">she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years</li>
<li class="L7669" rel="L7669">ago.</li>
<li class="L7670" rel="L7670"></li>
<li class="L7671" rel="L7671">“I am sure,” said she, “I cried for two days together when Colonel</li>
<li class="L7672" rel="L7672">Miller&#39;s regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart.”</li>
<li class="L7673" rel="L7673"></li>
<li class="L7674" rel="L7674">“I am sure I shall break _mine_,” said Lydia.</li>
<li class="L7675" rel="L7675"></li>
<li class="L7676" rel="L7676">“If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.</li>
<li class="L7677" rel="L7677"></li>
<li class="L7678" rel="L7678">“Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so</li>
<li class="L7679" rel="L7679">disagreeable.”</li>
<li class="L7680" rel="L7680"></li>
<li class="L7681" rel="L7681">“A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.”</li>
<li class="L7682" rel="L7682"></li>
<li class="L7683" rel="L7683">“And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,”</li>
<li class="L7684" rel="L7684"> added Kitty.</li>
<li class="L7685" rel="L7685"></li>
<li class="L7686" rel="L7686">Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through</li>
<li class="L7687" rel="L7687">Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense</li>
<li class="L7688" rel="L7688">of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy&#39;s</li>
<li class="L7689" rel="L7689">objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his</li>
<li class="L7690" rel="L7690">interference in the views of his friend.</li>
<li class="L7691" rel="L7691"></li>
<li class="L7692" rel="L7692">But the gloom of Lydia&#39;s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she</li>
<li class="L7693" rel="L7693">received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of</li>
<li class="L7694" rel="L7694">the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a</li>
<li class="L7695" rel="L7695">very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour</li>
<li class="L7696" rel="L7696">and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of</li>
<li class="L7697" rel="L7697">their _three_ months&#39; acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.</li>
<li class="L7698" rel="L7698"></li>
<li class="L7699" rel="L7699">The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,</li>
<li class="L7700" rel="L7700">the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely</li>
<li class="L7701" rel="L7701">to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister&#39;s feelings, Lydia</li>
<li class="L7702" rel="L7702">flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone&#39;s</li>
<li class="L7703" rel="L7703">congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;</li>
<li class="L7704" rel="L7704">whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate</li>
<li class="L7705" rel="L7705">in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.</li>
<li class="L7706" rel="L7706"></li>
<li class="L7707" rel="L7707">“I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,”</li>
<li class="L7708" rel="L7708"> said she, “Though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much</li>
<li class="L7709" rel="L7709">right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.”</li>
<li class="L7710" rel="L7710"></li>
<li class="L7711" rel="L7711">In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make</li>
<li class="L7712" rel="L7712">her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from</li>
<li class="L7713" rel="L7713">exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she</li>
<li class="L7714" rel="L7714">considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense</li>
<li class="L7715" rel="L7715">for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it</li>
<li class="L7716" rel="L7716">known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her</li>
<li class="L7717" rel="L7717">go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia&#39;s general</li>
<li class="L7718" rel="L7718">behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of</li>
<li class="L7719" rel="L7719">such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more</li>
<li class="L7720" rel="L7720">imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must</li>
<li class="L7721" rel="L7721">be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:</li>
<li class="L7722" rel="L7722"></li>
<li class="L7723" rel="L7723">“Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public</li>
<li class="L7724" rel="L7724">place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so</li>
<li class="L7725" rel="L7725">little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present</li>
<li class="L7726" rel="L7726">circumstances.”</li>
<li class="L7727" rel="L7727"></li>
<li class="L7728" rel="L7728">“If you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the very great disadvantage to</li>
<li class="L7729" rel="L7729">us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia&#39;s unguarded and</li>
<li class="L7730" rel="L7730">imprudent manner--nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you</li>
<li class="L7731" rel="L7731">would judge differently in the affair.”</li>
<li class="L7732" rel="L7732"></li>
<li class="L7733" rel="L7733">“Already arisen?” repeated Mr. Bennet. “What, has she frightened away</li>
<li class="L7734" rel="L7734">some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such</li>
<li class="L7735" rel="L7735">squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity</li>
<li class="L7736" rel="L7736">are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who</li>
<li class="L7737" rel="L7737">have been kept aloof by Lydia&#39;s folly.”</li>
<li class="L7738" rel="L7738"></li>
<li class="L7739" rel="L7739">“Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not</li>
<li class="L7740" rel="L7740">of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our</li>
<li class="L7741" rel="L7741">importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the</li>
<li class="L7742" rel="L7742">wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark</li>
<li class="L7743" rel="L7743">Lydia&#39;s character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear</li>
<li class="L7744" rel="L7744">father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and</li>
<li class="L7745" rel="L7745">of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of</li>
<li class="L7746" rel="L7746">her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character</li>
<li class="L7747" rel="L7747">will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt</li>
<li class="L7748" rel="L7748">that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the</li>
<li class="L7749" rel="L7749">worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond</li>
<li class="L7750" rel="L7750">youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness</li>
<li class="L7751" rel="L7751">of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal</li>
<li class="L7752" rel="L7752">contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger</li>
<li class="L7753" rel="L7753">Kitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,</li>
<li class="L7754" rel="L7754">ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you</li>
<li class="L7755" rel="L7755">suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever</li>
<li class="L7756" rel="L7756">they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the</li>
<li class="L7757" rel="L7757">disgrace?”</li>
<li class="L7758" rel="L7758"></li>
<li class="L7759" rel="L7759">Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and</li>
<li class="L7760" rel="L7760">affectionately taking her hand said in reply:</li>
<li class="L7761" rel="L7761"></li>
<li class="L7762" rel="L7762">“Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known</li>
<li class="L7763" rel="L7763">you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less</li>
<li class="L7764" rel="L7764">advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly</li>
<li class="L7765" rel="L7765">sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to</li>
<li class="L7766" rel="L7766">Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will</li>
<li class="L7767" rel="L7767">keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an</li>
<li class="L7768" rel="L7768">object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance</li>
<li class="L7769" rel="L7769">even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find</li>
<li class="L7770" rel="L7770">women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being</li>
<li class="L7771" rel="L7771">there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow</li>
<li class="L7772" rel="L7772">many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest</li>
<li class="L7773" rel="L7773">of her life.”</li>
<li class="L7774" rel="L7774"></li>
<li class="L7775" rel="L7775">With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion</li>
<li class="L7776" rel="L7776">continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not</li>
<li class="L7777" rel="L7777">in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on</li>
<li class="L7778" rel="L7778">them. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret</li>
<li class="L7779" rel="L7779">over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her</li>
<li class="L7780" rel="L7780">disposition.</li>
<li class="L7781" rel="L7781"></li>
<li class="L7782" rel="L7782">Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her</li>
<li class="L7783" rel="L7783">father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their</li>
<li class="L7784" rel="L7784">united volubility. In Lydia&#39;s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised</li>
<li class="L7785" rel="L7785">every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye</li>
<li class="L7786" rel="L7786">of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.</li>
<li class="L7787" rel="L7787">She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them</li>
<li class="L7788" rel="L7788">at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp--its tents</li>
<li class="L7789" rel="L7789">stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young</li>
<li class="L7790" rel="L7790">and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she</li>
<li class="L7791" rel="L7791">saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six</li>
<li class="L7792" rel="L7792">officers at once.</li>
<li class="L7793" rel="L7793"></li>
<li class="L7794" rel="L7794">Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such</li>
<li class="L7795" rel="L7795">realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have</li>
<li class="L7796" rel="L7796">been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.</li>
<li class="L7797" rel="L7797">Lydia&#39;s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy</li>
<li class="L7798" rel="L7798">conviction of her husband&#39;s never intending to go there himself.</li>
<li class="L7799" rel="L7799"></li>
<li class="L7800" rel="L7800">But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures</li>
<li class="L7801" rel="L7801">continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia&#39;s leaving</li>
<li class="L7802" rel="L7802">home.</li>
<li class="L7803" rel="L7803"></li>
<li class="L7804" rel="L7804">Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been</li>
<li class="L7805" rel="L7805">frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty</li>
<li class="L7806" rel="L7806">well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even</li>
<li class="L7807" rel="L7807">learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted</li>
<li class="L7808" rel="L7808">her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present</li>
<li class="L7809" rel="L7809">behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,</li>
<li class="L7810" rel="L7810">for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which</li>
<li class="L7811" rel="L7811">had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after</li>
<li class="L7812" rel="L7812">what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in</li>
<li class="L7813" rel="L7813">finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous</li>
<li class="L7814" rel="L7814">gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the</li>
<li class="L7815" rel="L7815">reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever</li>
<li class="L7816" rel="L7816">cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,</li>
<li class="L7817" rel="L7817">and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.</li>
<li class="L7818" rel="L7818"></li>
<li class="L7819" rel="L7819">On the very last day of the regiment&#39;s remaining at Meryton, he dined,</li>
<li class="L7820" rel="L7820">with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth</li>
<li class="L7821" rel="L7821">disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some</li>
<li class="L7822" rel="L7822">inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she</li>
<li class="L7823" rel="L7823">mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam&#39;s and Mr. Darcy&#39;s having both spent three</li>
<li class="L7824" rel="L7824">weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.</li>
<li class="L7825" rel="L7825"></li>
<li class="L7826" rel="L7826">He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment&#39;s</li>
<li class="L7827" rel="L7827">recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen</li>
<li class="L7828" rel="L7828">him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,</li>
<li class="L7829" rel="L7829">asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.</li>
<li class="L7830" rel="L7830">With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:</li>
<li class="L7831" rel="L7831"></li>
<li class="L7832" rel="L7832">“How long did you say he was at Rosings?”</li>
<li class="L7833" rel="L7833"></li>
<li class="L7834" rel="L7834">“Nearly three weeks.”</li>
<li class="L7835" rel="L7835"></li>
<li class="L7836" rel="L7836">“And you saw him frequently?”</li>
<li class="L7837" rel="L7837"></li>
<li class="L7838" rel="L7838">“Yes, almost every day.”</li>
<li class="L7839" rel="L7839"></li>
<li class="L7840" rel="L7840">“His manners are very different from his cousin&#39;s.”</li>
<li class="L7841" rel="L7841"></li>
<li class="L7842" rel="L7842">“Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.”</li>
<li class="L7843" rel="L7843"></li>
<li class="L7844" rel="L7844">“Indeed!” cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. “And</li>
<li class="L7845" rel="L7845">pray, may I ask?--” But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “Is</li>
<li class="L7846" rel="L7846">it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility</li>
<li class="L7847" rel="L7847">to his ordinary style?--for I dare not hope,” he continued in a lower</li>
<li class="L7848" rel="L7848">and more serious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.”</li>
<li class="L7849" rel="L7849"></li>
<li class="L7850" rel="L7850">“Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, I believe, he is very much</li>
<li class="L7851" rel="L7851">what he ever was.”</li>
<li class="L7852" rel="L7852"></li>
<li class="L7853" rel="L7853">While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to</li>
<li class="L7854" rel="L7854">rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a</li>
<li class="L7855" rel="L7855">something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive</li>
<li class="L7856" rel="L7856">and anxious attention, while she added:</li>
<li class="L7857" rel="L7857"></li>
<li class="L7858" rel="L7858">“When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that</li>
<li class="L7859" rel="L7859">his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from</li>
<li class="L7860" rel="L7860">knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”</li>
<li class="L7861" rel="L7861"></li>
<li class="L7862" rel="L7862">Wickham&#39;s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated</li>
<li class="L7863" rel="L7863">look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his</li>
<li class="L7864" rel="L7864">embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of</li>
<li class="L7865" rel="L7865">accents:</li>
<li class="L7866" rel="L7866"></li>
<li class="L7867" rel="L7867">“You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily</li>
<li class="L7868" rel="L7868">comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume</li>
<li class="L7869" rel="L7869">even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,</li>
<li class="L7870" rel="L7870">may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only</li>
<li class="L7871" rel="L7871">deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only</li>
<li class="L7872" rel="L7872">fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been</li>
<li class="L7873" rel="L7873">alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good</li>
<li class="L7874" rel="L7874">opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always</li>
<li class="L7875" rel="L7875">operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be</li>
<li class="L7876" rel="L7876">imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I</li>
<li class="L7877" rel="L7877">am certain he has very much at heart.”</li>
<li class="L7878" rel="L7878"></li>
<li class="L7879" rel="L7879">Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a</li>
<li class="L7880" rel="L7880">slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on</li>
<li class="L7881" rel="L7881">the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge</li>
<li class="L7882" rel="L7882">him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his</li>
<li class="L7883" rel="L7883">side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish</li>
<li class="L7884" rel="L7884">Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a</li>
<li class="L7885" rel="L7885">mutual desire of never meeting again.</li>
<li class="L7886" rel="L7886"></li>
<li class="L7887" rel="L7887">When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,</li>
<li class="L7888" rel="L7888">from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation</li>
<li class="L7889" rel="L7889">between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the</li>
<li class="L7890" rel="L7890">only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.</li>
<li class="L7891" rel="L7891">Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,</li>
<li class="L7892" rel="L7892">and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the</li>
<li class="L7893" rel="L7893">opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible--advice which</li>
<li class="L7894" rel="L7894">there was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in</li>
<li class="L7895" rel="L7895">the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more</li>
<li class="L7896" rel="L7896">gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.</li>
<li class="L7897" rel="L7897"></li>
<li class="L7898" rel="L7898"></li>
<li class="L7899" rel="L7899"></li>
<li class="L7900" rel="L7900">Chapter 42</li>
<li class="L7901" rel="L7901"></li>
<li class="L7902" rel="L7902"></li>
<li class="L7903" rel="L7903">Had Elizabeth&#39;s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could</li>
<li class="L7904" rel="L7904">not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic</li>
<li class="L7905" rel="L7905">comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance</li>
<li class="L7906" rel="L7906">of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a</li>
<li class="L7907" rel="L7907">woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in</li>
<li class="L7908" rel="L7908">their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,</li>
<li class="L7909" rel="L7909">esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views</li>
<li class="L7910" rel="L7910">of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of</li>
<li class="L7911" rel="L7911">a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own</li>
<li class="L7912" rel="L7912">imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often</li>
<li class="L7913" rel="L7913">console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of</li>
<li class="L7914" rel="L7914">the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal</li>
<li class="L7915" rel="L7915">enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as</li>
<li class="L7916" rel="L7916">her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not</li>
<li class="L7917" rel="L7917">the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his</li>
<li class="L7918" rel="L7918">wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true</li>
<li class="L7919" rel="L7919">philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.</li>
<li class="L7920" rel="L7920"></li>
<li class="L7921" rel="L7921">Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her</li>
<li class="L7922" rel="L7922">father&#39;s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but</li>
<li class="L7923" rel="L7923">respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of</li>
<li class="L7924" rel="L7924">herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to</li>
<li class="L7925" rel="L7925">banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation</li>
<li class="L7926" rel="L7926">and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own</li>
<li class="L7927" rel="L7927">children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so</li>
<li class="L7928" rel="L7928">strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so</li>
<li class="L7929" rel="L7929">unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising</li>
<li class="L7930" rel="L7930">from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,</li>
<li class="L7931" rel="L7931">might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even</li>
<li class="L7932" rel="L7932">if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.</li>
<li class="L7933" rel="L7933"></li>
<li class="L7934" rel="L7934">When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham&#39;s departure she found little</li>
<li class="L7935" rel="L7935">other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties</li>
<li class="L7936" rel="L7936">abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and</li>
<li class="L7937" rel="L7937">sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around</li>
<li class="L7938" rel="L7938">them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty</li>
<li class="L7939" rel="L7939">might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers</li>
<li class="L7940" rel="L7940">of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition</li>
<li class="L7941" rel="L7941">greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all</li>
<li class="L7942" rel="L7942">her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a</li>
<li class="L7943" rel="L7943">watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what</li>
<li class="L7944" rel="L7944">has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had been</li>
<li class="L7945" rel="L7945">looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the</li>
<li class="L7946" rel="L7946">satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to</li>
<li class="L7947" rel="L7947">name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity--to have</li>
<li class="L7948" rel="L7948">some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by</li>
<li class="L7949" rel="L7949">again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the</li>
<li class="L7950" rel="L7950">present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes</li>
<li class="L7951" rel="L7951">was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation</li>
<li class="L7952" rel="L7952">for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother</li>
<li class="L7953" rel="L7953">and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the</li>
<li class="L7954" rel="L7954">scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.</li>
<li class="L7955" rel="L7955"></li>
<li class="L7956" rel="L7956">“But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish for.</li>
<li class="L7957" rel="L7957">Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.</li>
<li class="L7958" rel="L7958">But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my</li>
<li class="L7959" rel="L7959">sister&#39;s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of</li>
<li class="L7960" rel="L7960">pleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can</li>
<li class="L7961" rel="L7961">never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by</li>
<li class="L7962" rel="L7962">the defence of some little peculiar vexation.”</li>
<li class="L7963" rel="L7963"></li>
<li class="L7964" rel="L7964">When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely</li>
<li class="L7965" rel="L7965">to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and</li>
<li class="L7966" rel="L7966">always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that</li>
<li class="L7967" rel="L7967">they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers</li>
<li class="L7968" rel="L7968">had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as</li>
<li class="L7969" rel="L7969">made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which</li>
<li class="L7970" rel="L7970">she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a</li>
<li class="L7971" rel="L7971">violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to</li>
<li class="L7972" rel="L7972">the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still</li>
<li class="L7973" rel="L7973">less to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were</li>
<li class="L7974" rel="L7974">much too full of lines under the words to be made public.</li>
<li class="L7975" rel="L7975"></li>
<li class="L7976" rel="L7976">After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good</li>
<li class="L7977" rel="L7977">humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore</li>
<li class="L7978" rel="L7978">a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came</li>
<li class="L7979" rel="L7979">back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet</li>
<li class="L7980" rel="L7980">was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of</li>
<li class="L7981" rel="L7981">June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without</li>
<li class="L7982" rel="L7982">tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by</li>
<li class="L7983" rel="L7983">the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to</li>
<li class="L7984" rel="L7984">mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious</li>
<li class="L7985" rel="L7985">arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in</li>
<li class="L7986" rel="L7986">Meryton.</li>
<li class="L7987" rel="L7987"></li>
<li class="L7988" rel="L7988">The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast</li>
<li class="L7989" rel="L7989">approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter</li>
<li class="L7990" rel="L7990">arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and</li>
<li class="L7991" rel="L7991">curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from</li>
<li class="L7992" rel="L7992">setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again</li>
<li class="L7993" rel="L7993">within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so</li>
<li class="L7994" rel="L7994">far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with</li>
<li class="L7995" rel="L7995">the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up</li>
<li class="L7996" rel="L7996">the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the</li>
<li class="L7997" rel="L7997">present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that</li>
<li class="L7998" rel="L7998">county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three</li>
<li class="L7999" rel="L7999">weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The</li>
<li class="L8000" rel="L8000">town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where</li>
<li class="L8001" rel="L8001">they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of</li>
<li class="L8002" rel="L8002">her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,</li>
<li class="L8003" rel="L8003">Dovedale, or the Peak.</li>
<li class="L8004" rel="L8004"></li>
<li class="L8005" rel="L8005">Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing</li>
<li class="L8006" rel="L8006">the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it</li>
<li class="L8007" rel="L8007">was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;</li>
<li class="L8008" rel="L8008">and all was soon right again.</li>
<li class="L8009" rel="L8009"></li>
<li class="L8010" rel="L8010">With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was</li>
<li class="L8011" rel="L8011">impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its</li>
<li class="L8012" rel="L8012">owner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity,</li>
<li class="L8013" rel="L8013">and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.”</li>
<li class="L8014" rel="L8014"></li>
<li class="L8015" rel="L8015">The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away</li>
<li class="L8016" rel="L8016">before her uncle and aunt&#39;s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr.</li>
<li class="L8017" rel="L8017">and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at</li>
<li class="L8018" rel="L8018">Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two</li>
<li class="L8019" rel="L8019">younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their</li>
<li class="L8020" rel="L8020">cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and</li>
<li class="L8021" rel="L8021">sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every</li>
<li class="L8022" rel="L8022">way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.</li>
<li class="L8023" rel="L8023"></li>
<li class="L8024" rel="L8024">The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the</li>
<li class="L8025" rel="L8025">next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.</li>
<li class="L8026" rel="L8026">One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness of companions;</li>
<li class="L8027" rel="L8027">a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear</li>
<li class="L8028" rel="L8028">inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection</li>
<li class="L8029" rel="L8029">and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were</li>
<li class="L8030" rel="L8030">disappointments abroad.</li>
<li class="L8031" rel="L8031"></li>
<li class="L8032" rel="L8032">It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,</li>
<li class="L8033" rel="L8033">nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither</li>
<li class="L8034" rel="L8034">lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are</li>
<li class="L8035" rel="L8035">sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present</li>
<li class="L8036" rel="L8036">concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner&#39;s</li>
<li class="L8037" rel="L8037">former residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance</li>
<li class="L8038" rel="L8038">still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the</li>
<li class="L8039" rel="L8039">principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton,</li>
<li class="L8040" rel="L8040">Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not</li>
<li class="L8041" rel="L8041">in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In</li>
<li class="L8042" rel="L8042">talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed</li>
<li class="L8043" rel="L8043">an inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his</li>
<li class="L8044" rel="L8044">willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.</li>
<li class="L8045" rel="L8045"></li>
<li class="L8046" rel="L8046">“My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard</li>
<li class="L8047" rel="L8047">so much?” said her aunt; “a place, too, with which so many of your</li>
<li class="L8048" rel="L8048">acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you</li>
<li class="L8049" rel="L8049">know.”</li>
<li class="L8050" rel="L8050"></li>
<li class="L8051" rel="L8051">Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at</li>
<li class="L8052" rel="L8052">Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She</li>
<li class="L8053" rel="L8053">must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so</li>
<li class="L8054" rel="L8054">many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.</li>
<li class="L8055" rel="L8055"></li>
<li class="L8056" rel="L8056">Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine house</li>
<li class="L8057" rel="L8057">richly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but</li>
<li class="L8058" rel="L8058">the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the</li>
<li class="L8059" rel="L8059">country.”</li>
<li class="L8060" rel="L8060"></li>
<li class="L8061" rel="L8061">Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce. The</li>
<li class="L8062" rel="L8062">possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly</li>
<li class="L8063" rel="L8063">occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and</li>
<li class="L8064" rel="L8064">thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such</li>
<li class="L8065" rel="L8065">a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved</li>
<li class="L8066" rel="L8066">that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the</li>
<li class="L8067" rel="L8067">absence of the family were unfavourably answered.</li>
<li class="L8068" rel="L8068"></li>
<li class="L8069" rel="L8069">Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid</li>
<li class="L8070" rel="L8070">whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its</li>
<li class="L8071" rel="L8071">proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for</li>
<li class="L8072" rel="L8072">the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her</li>
<li class="L8073" rel="L8073">alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of</li>
<li class="L8074" rel="L8074">curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the</li>
<li class="L8075" rel="L8075">next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and</li>
<li class="L8076" rel="L8076">with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike</li>
<li class="L8077" rel="L8077">to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.</li>
<li class="L8078" rel="L8078"></li>
<li class="L8079" rel="L8079"></li>
<li class="L8080" rel="L8080"></li>
<li class="L8081" rel="L8081">Chapter 43</li>
<li class="L8082" rel="L8082"></li>
<li class="L8083" rel="L8083"></li>
<li class="L8084" rel="L8084">Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of</li>
<li class="L8085" rel="L8085">Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned</li>
<li class="L8086" rel="L8086">in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.</li>
<li class="L8087" rel="L8087"></li>
<li class="L8088" rel="L8088">The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They</li>
<li class="L8089" rel="L8089">entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through</li>
<li class="L8090" rel="L8090">a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.</li>
<li class="L8091" rel="L8091"></li>
<li class="L8092" rel="L8092">Elizabeth&#39;s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired</li>
<li class="L8093" rel="L8093">every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for</li>
<li class="L8094" rel="L8094">half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable</li>
<li class="L8095" rel="L8095">eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by</li>
<li class="L8096" rel="L8096">Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which</li>
<li class="L8097" rel="L8097">the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone</li>
<li class="L8098" rel="L8098">building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of</li>
<li class="L8099" rel="L8099">high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was</li>
<li class="L8100" rel="L8100">swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks</li>
<li class="L8101" rel="L8101">were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She</li>
<li class="L8102" rel="L8102">had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural</li>
<li class="L8103" rel="L8103">beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were</li>
<li class="L8104" rel="L8104">all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that</li>
<li class="L8105" rel="L8105">to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!</li>
<li class="L8106" rel="L8106"></li>
<li class="L8107" rel="L8107">They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,</li>
<li class="L8108" rel="L8108">while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of</li>
<li class="L8109" rel="L8109">meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been</li>
<li class="L8110" rel="L8110">mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the</li>
<li class="L8111" rel="L8111">hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to</li>
<li class="L8112" rel="L8112">wonder at her being where she was.</li>
<li class="L8113" rel="L8113"></li>
<li class="L8114" rel="L8114">The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less</li>
<li class="L8115" rel="L8115">fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They</li>
<li class="L8116" rel="L8116">followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned</li>
<li class="L8117" rel="L8117">room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went</li>
<li class="L8118" rel="L8118">to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which</li>
<li class="L8119" rel="L8119">they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,</li>
<li class="L8120" rel="L8120">was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and</li>
<li class="L8121" rel="L8121">she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its</li>
<li class="L8122" rel="L8122">banks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it,</li>
<li class="L8123" rel="L8123">with delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking</li>
<li class="L8124" rel="L8124">different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be</li>
<li class="L8125" rel="L8125">seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to</li>
<li class="L8126" rel="L8126">the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of</li>
<li class="L8127" rel="L8127">his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of</li>
<li class="L8128" rel="L8128">splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.</li>
<li class="L8129" rel="L8129"></li>
<li class="L8130" rel="L8130">“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress! With</li>
<li class="L8131" rel="L8131">these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of</li>
<li class="L8132" rel="L8132">viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and</li>
<li class="L8133" rel="L8133">welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,”--recollecting</li>
<li class="L8134" rel="L8134">herself--“that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to</li>
<li class="L8135" rel="L8135">me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”</li>
<li class="L8136" rel="L8136"></li>
<li class="L8137" rel="L8137">This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something very like</li>
<li class="L8138" rel="L8138">regret.</li>
<li class="L8139" rel="L8139"></li>
<li class="L8140" rel="L8140">She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really</li>
<li class="L8141" rel="L8141">absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question</li>
<li class="L8142" rel="L8142">was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.</li>
<li class="L8143" rel="L8143">Reynolds replied that he was, adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with</li>
<li class="L8144" rel="L8144">a large party of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own</li>
<li class="L8145" rel="L8145">journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!</li>
<li class="L8146" rel="L8146"></li>
<li class="L8147" rel="L8147">Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the</li>
<li class="L8148" rel="L8148">likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures,</li>
<li class="L8149" rel="L8149">over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.</li>
<li class="L8150" rel="L8150">The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young</li>
<li class="L8151" rel="L8151">gentleman, the son of her late master&#39;s steward, who had been brought</li>
<li class="L8152" rel="L8152">up by him at his own expense. “He is now gone into the army,” she added;</li>
<li class="L8153" rel="L8153">“but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.”</li>
<li class="L8154" rel="L8154"></li>
<li class="L8155" rel="L8155">Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not</li>
<li class="L8156" rel="L8156">return it.</li>
<li class="L8157" rel="L8157"></li>
<li class="L8158" rel="L8158">“And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,</li>
<li class="L8159" rel="L8159">“is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the</li>
<li class="L8160" rel="L8160">other--about eight years ago.”</li>
<li class="L8161" rel="L8161"></li>
<li class="L8162" rel="L8162">“I have heard much of your master&#39;s fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner,</li>
<li class="L8163" rel="L8163">looking at the picture; “it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell</li>
<li class="L8164" rel="L8164">us whether it is like or not.”</li>
<li class="L8165" rel="L8165"></li>
<li class="L8166" rel="L8166">Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this</li>
<li class="L8167" rel="L8167">intimation of her knowing her master.</li>
<li class="L8168" rel="L8168"></li>
<li class="L8169" rel="L8169">“Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”</li>
<li class="L8170" rel="L8170"></li>
<li class="L8171" rel="L8171">Elizabeth coloured, and said: “A little.”</li>
<li class="L8172" rel="L8172"></li>
<li class="L8173" rel="L8173">“And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma&#39;am?”</li>
<li class="L8174" rel="L8174"></li>
<li class="L8175" rel="L8175">“Yes, very handsome.”</li>
<li class="L8176" rel="L8176"></li>
<li class="L8177" rel="L8177">“I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you</li>
<li class="L8178" rel="L8178">will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late</li>
<li class="L8179" rel="L8179">master&#39;s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to</li>
<li class="L8180" rel="L8180">be then. He was very fond of them.”</li>
<li class="L8181" rel="L8181"></li>
<li class="L8182" rel="L8182">This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham&#39;s being among them.</li>
<li class="L8183" rel="L8183"></li>
<li class="L8184" rel="L8184">Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn</li>
<li class="L8185" rel="L8185">when she was only eight years old.</li>
<li class="L8186" rel="L8186"></li>
<li class="L8187" rel="L8187">“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mrs. Gardiner.</li>
<li class="L8188" rel="L8188"></li>
<li class="L8189" rel="L8189">“Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so</li>
<li class="L8190" rel="L8190">accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is</li>
<li class="L8191" rel="L8191">a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she</li>
<li class="L8192" rel="L8192">comes here to-morrow with him.”</li>
<li class="L8193" rel="L8193"></li>
<li class="L8194" rel="L8194">Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her</li>
<li class="L8195" rel="L8195">communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either</li>
<li class="L8196" rel="L8196">by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her</li>
<li class="L8197" rel="L8197">master and his sister.</li>
<li class="L8198" rel="L8198"></li>
<li class="L8199" rel="L8199">“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”</li>
<li class="L8200" rel="L8200"></li>
<li class="L8201" rel="L8201">“Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his</li>
<li class="L8202" rel="L8202">time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”</li>
<li class="L8203" rel="L8203"></li>
<li class="L8204" rel="L8204">“Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”</li>
<li class="L8205" rel="L8205"></li>
<li class="L8206" rel="L8206">“If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”</li>
<li class="L8207" rel="L8207"></li>
<li class="L8208" rel="L8208">“Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is</li>
<li class="L8209" rel="L8209">good enough for him.”</li>
<li class="L8210" rel="L8210"></li>
<li class="L8211" rel="L8211">Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is</li>
<li class="L8212" rel="L8212">very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”</li>
<li class="L8213" rel="L8213"></li>
<li class="L8214" rel="L8214">“I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him,”</li>
<li class="L8215" rel="L8215"> replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she</li>
<li class="L8216" rel="L8216">listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, “I have</li>
<li class="L8217" rel="L8217">never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever</li>
<li class="L8218" rel="L8218">since he was four years old.”</li>
<li class="L8219" rel="L8219"></li>
<li class="L8220" rel="L8220">This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her</li>
<li class="L8221" rel="L8221">ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.</li>
<li class="L8222" rel="L8222">Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was</li>
<li class="L8223" rel="L8223">grateful to her uncle for saying:</li>
<li class="L8224" rel="L8224"></li>
<li class="L8225" rel="L8225">“There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in</li>
<li class="L8226" rel="L8226">having such a master.”</li>
<li class="L8227" rel="L8227"></li>
<li class="L8228" rel="L8228">“Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could</li>
<li class="L8229" rel="L8229">not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are</li>
<li class="L8230" rel="L8230">good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and</li>
<li class="L8231" rel="L8231">he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the</li>
<li class="L8232" rel="L8232">world.”</li>
<li class="L8233" rel="L8233"></li>
<li class="L8234" rel="L8234">Elizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.</li>
<li class="L8235" rel="L8235"></li>
<li class="L8236" rel="L8236">“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.</li>
<li class="L8237" rel="L8237"></li>
<li class="L8238" rel="L8238">“Yes, ma&#39;am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just</li>
<li class="L8239" rel="L8239">as affable to the poor.”</li>
<li class="L8240" rel="L8240"></li>
<li class="L8241" rel="L8241">Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.</li>
<li class="L8242" rel="L8242">Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects</li>
<li class="L8243" rel="L8243">of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the</li>
<li class="L8244" rel="L8244">furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family</li>
<li class="L8245" rel="L8245">prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her</li>
<li class="L8246" rel="L8246">master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his</li>
<li class="L8247" rel="L8247">many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.</li>
<li class="L8248" rel="L8248"></li>
<li class="L8249" rel="L8249">“He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever</li>
<li class="L8250" rel="L8250">lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but</li>
<li class="L8251" rel="L8251">themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give</li>
<li class="L8252" rel="L8252">him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw</li>
<li class="L8253" rel="L8253">anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away</li>
<li class="L8254" rel="L8254">like other young men.”</li>
<li class="L8255" rel="L8255"></li>
<li class="L8256" rel="L8256">“In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.</li>
<li class="L8257" rel="L8257"></li>
<li class="L8258" rel="L8258">“This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not</li>
<li class="L8259" rel="L8259">quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”</li>
<li class="L8260" rel="L8260"></li>
<li class="L8261" rel="L8261">“Perhaps we might be deceived.”</li>
<li class="L8262" rel="L8262"></li>
<li class="L8263" rel="L8263">“That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”</li>
<li class="L8264" rel="L8264"></li>
<li class="L8265" rel="L8265">On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty</li>
<li class="L8266" rel="L8266">sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than</li>
<li class="L8267" rel="L8267">the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to</li>
<li class="L8268" rel="L8268">give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when</li>
<li class="L8269" rel="L8269">last at Pemberley.</li>
<li class="L8270" rel="L8270"></li>
<li class="L8271" rel="L8271">“He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked towards</li>
<li class="L8272" rel="L8272">one of the windows.</li>
<li class="L8273" rel="L8273"></li>
<li class="L8274" rel="L8274">Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy&#39;s delight, when she should enter</li>
<li class="L8275" rel="L8275">the room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added. “Whatever</li>
<li class="L8276" rel="L8276">can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There</li>
<li class="L8277" rel="L8277">is nothing he would not do for her.”</li>
<li class="L8278" rel="L8278"></li>
<li class="L8279" rel="L8279">The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were</li>
<li class="L8280" rel="L8280">all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings;</li>
<li class="L8281" rel="L8281">but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already</li>
<li class="L8282" rel="L8282">visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss</li>
<li class="L8283" rel="L8283">Darcy&#39;s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and</li>
<li class="L8284" rel="L8284">also more intelligible.</li>
<li class="L8285" rel="L8285"></li>
<li class="L8286" rel="L8286">In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have</li>
<li class="L8287" rel="L8287">little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of</li>
<li class="L8288" rel="L8288">the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested</li>
<li class="L8289" rel="L8289">her--and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a</li>
<li class="L8290" rel="L8290">smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he</li>
<li class="L8291" rel="L8291">looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest</li>
<li class="L8292" rel="L8292">contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.</li>
<li class="L8293" rel="L8293">Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father&#39;s</li>
<li class="L8294" rel="L8294">lifetime.</li>
<li class="L8295" rel="L8295"></li>
<li class="L8296" rel="L8296">There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth&#39;s mind, a more gentle</li>
<li class="L8297" rel="L8297">sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of</li>
<li class="L8298" rel="L8298">their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds</li>
<li class="L8299" rel="L8299">was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise</li>
<li class="L8300" rel="L8300">of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she</li>
<li class="L8301" rel="L8301">considered how many people&#39;s happiness were in his guardianship!--how</li>
<li class="L8302" rel="L8302">much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much of</li>
<li class="L8303" rel="L8303">good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought</li>
<li class="L8304" rel="L8304">forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she</li>
<li class="L8305" rel="L8305">stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his</li>
<li class="L8306" rel="L8306">eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of</li>
<li class="L8307" rel="L8307">gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and</li>
<li class="L8308" rel="L8308">softened its impropriety of expression.</li>
<li class="L8309" rel="L8309"></li>
<li class="L8310" rel="L8310">When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,</li>
<li class="L8311" rel="L8311">they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were</li>
<li class="L8312" rel="L8312">consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.</li>
<li class="L8313" rel="L8313"></li>
<li class="L8314" rel="L8314">As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back</li>
<li class="L8315" rel="L8315">to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former</li>
<li class="L8316" rel="L8316">was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself</li>
<li class="L8317" rel="L8317">suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.</li>
<li class="L8318" rel="L8318"></li>
<li class="L8319" rel="L8319">They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his</li>
<li class="L8320" rel="L8320">appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes</li>
<li class="L8321" rel="L8321">instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest</li>
<li class="L8322" rel="L8322">blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from</li>
<li class="L8323" rel="L8323">surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,</li>
<li class="L8324" rel="L8324">and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least</li>
<li class="L8325" rel="L8325">of perfect civility.</li>
<li class="L8326" rel="L8326"></li>
<li class="L8327" rel="L8327">She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,</li>
<li class="L8328" rel="L8328">received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be</li>
<li class="L8329" rel="L8329">overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture</li>
<li class="L8330" rel="L8330">they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two</li>
<li class="L8331" rel="L8331">that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener&#39;s expression of surprise, on</li>
<li class="L8332" rel="L8332">beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little</li>
<li class="L8333" rel="L8333">aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,</li>
<li class="L8334" rel="L8334">scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer</li>
<li class="L8335" rel="L8335">she returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the</li>
<li class="L8336" rel="L8336">alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that</li>
<li class="L8337" rel="L8337">he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the</li>
<li class="L8338" rel="L8338">impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few</li>
<li class="L8339" rel="L8339">minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in</li>
<li class="L8340" rel="L8340">her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent</li>
<li class="L8341" rel="L8341">had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as</li>
<li class="L8342" rel="L8342">to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in</li>
<li class="L8343" rel="L8343">Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the</li>
<li class="L8344" rel="L8344">distraction of his thoughts.</li>
<li class="L8345" rel="L8345"></li>
<li class="L8346" rel="L8346">At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few</li>
<li class="L8347" rel="L8347">moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took</li>
<li class="L8348" rel="L8348">leave.</li>
<li class="L8349" rel="L8349"></li>
<li class="L8350" rel="L8350">The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but</li>
<li class="L8351" rel="L8351">Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,</li>
<li class="L8352" rel="L8352">followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her</li>
<li class="L8353" rel="L8353">coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the</li>
<li class="L8354" rel="L8354">world! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light</li>
<li class="L8355" rel="L8355">might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely</li>
<li class="L8356" rel="L8356">thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he</li>
<li class="L8357" rel="L8357">thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes</li>
<li class="L8358" rel="L8358">sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination;</li>
<li class="L8359" rel="L8359">for it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted</li>
<li class="L8360" rel="L8360">from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over</li>
<li class="L8361" rel="L8361">the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly</li>
<li class="L8362" rel="L8362">altered--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was</li>
<li class="L8363" rel="L8363">amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!</li>
<li class="L8364" rel="L8364">Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never</li>
<li class="L8365" rel="L8365">had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What</li>
<li class="L8366" rel="L8366">a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put</li>
<li class="L8367" rel="L8367">his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account</li>
<li class="L8368" rel="L8368">for it.</li>
<li class="L8369" rel="L8369"></li>
<li class="L8370" rel="L8370">They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and</li>
<li class="L8371" rel="L8371">every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer</li>
<li class="L8372" rel="L8372">reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time</li>
<li class="L8373" rel="L8373">before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered</li>
<li class="L8374" rel="L8374">mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and</li>
<li class="L8375" rel="L8375">seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she</li>
<li class="L8376" rel="L8376">distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that</li>
<li class="L8377" rel="L8377">one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then</li>
<li class="L8378" rel="L8378">was. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--in</li>
<li class="L8379" rel="L8379">what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,</li>
<li class="L8380" rel="L8380">she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he</li>
<li class="L8381" rel="L8381">felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was</li>
<li class="L8382" rel="L8382">not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in</li>
<li class="L8383" rel="L8383">seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with</li>
<li class="L8384" rel="L8384">composure.</li>
<li class="L8385" rel="L8385"></li>
<li class="L8386" rel="L8386">At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind</li>
<li class="L8387" rel="L8387">aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.</li>
<li class="L8388" rel="L8388"></li>
<li class="L8389" rel="L8389">They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,</li>
<li class="L8390" rel="L8390">ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of</li>
<li class="L8391" rel="L8391">the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the</li>
<li class="L8392" rel="L8392">valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading</li>
<li class="L8393" rel="L8393">many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish</li>
<li class="L8394" rel="L8394">of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.</li>
<li class="L8395" rel="L8395">With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.</li>
<li class="L8396" rel="L8396">It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which</li>
<li class="L8397" rel="L8397">brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods,</li>
<li class="L8398" rel="L8398">to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed</li>
<li class="L8399" rel="L8399">it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene;</li>
<li class="L8400" rel="L8400">it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the</li>
<li class="L8401" rel="L8401">valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,</li>
<li class="L8402" rel="L8402">and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.</li>
<li class="L8403" rel="L8403">Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the</li>
<li class="L8404" rel="L8404">bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,</li>
<li class="L8405" rel="L8405">who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only</li>
<li class="L8406" rel="L8406">of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,</li>
<li class="L8407" rel="L8407">therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house</li>
<li class="L8408" rel="L8408">on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their</li>
<li class="L8409" rel="L8409">progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the</li>
<li class="L8410" rel="L8410">taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the</li>
<li class="L8411" rel="L8411">occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the</li>
<li class="L8412" rel="L8412">man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this</li>
<li class="L8413" rel="L8413">slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth&#39;s astonishment</li>
<li class="L8414" rel="L8414">was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy</li>
<li class="L8415" rel="L8415">approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here</li>
<li class="L8416" rel="L8416">less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before</li>
<li class="L8417" rel="L8417">they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared</li>
<li class="L8418" rel="L8418">for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with</li>
<li class="L8419" rel="L8419">calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,</li>
<li class="L8420" rel="L8420">she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea</li>
<li class="L8421" rel="L8421">lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the</li>
<li class="L8422" rel="L8422">turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw</li>
<li class="L8423" rel="L8423">that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his</li>
<li class="L8424" rel="L8424">politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;</li>
<li class="L8425" rel="L8425">but she had not got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when</li>
<li class="L8426" rel="L8426">some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of</li>
<li class="L8427" rel="L8427">Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed,</li>
<li class="L8428" rel="L8428">and she said no more.</li>
<li class="L8429" rel="L8429"></li>
<li class="L8430" rel="L8430">Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked</li>
<li class="L8431" rel="L8431">her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.</li>
<li class="L8432" rel="L8432">This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared;</li>
<li class="L8433" rel="L8433">and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the</li>
<li class="L8434" rel="L8434">acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had</li>
<li class="L8435" rel="L8435">revolted in his offer to herself. “What will be his surprise,” thought</li>
<li class="L8436" rel="L8436">she, “when he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of</li>
<li class="L8437" rel="L8437">fashion.”</li>
<li class="L8438" rel="L8438"></li>
<li class="L8439" rel="L8439">The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their</li>
<li class="L8440" rel="L8440">relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore</li>
<li class="L8441" rel="L8441">it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he</li>
<li class="L8442" rel="L8442">could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the</li>
<li class="L8443" rel="L8443">connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and</li>
<li class="L8444" rel="L8444">so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into</li>
<li class="L8445" rel="L8445">conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,</li>
<li class="L8446" rel="L8446">could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had</li>
<li class="L8447" rel="L8447">some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most</li>
<li class="L8448" rel="L8448">attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every</li>
<li class="L8449" rel="L8449">expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,</li>
<li class="L8450" rel="L8450">his taste, or his good manners.</li>
<li class="L8451" rel="L8451"></li>
<li class="L8452" rel="L8452">The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy</li>
<li class="L8453" rel="L8453">invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he</li>
<li class="L8454" rel="L8454">chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time</li>
<li class="L8455" rel="L8455">to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of</li>
<li class="L8456" rel="L8456">the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was</li>
<li class="L8457" rel="L8457">walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.</li>
<li class="L8458" rel="L8458">Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment</li>
<li class="L8459" rel="L8459">must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and</li>
<li class="L8460" rel="L8460">continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From what can</li>
<li class="L8461" rel="L8461">it proceed? It cannot be for _me_--it cannot be for _my_ sake that his</li>
<li class="L8462" rel="L8462">manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a</li>
<li class="L8463" rel="L8463">change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.”</li>
<li class="L8464" rel="L8464"></li>
<li class="L8465" rel="L8465">After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two</li>
<li class="L8466" rel="L8466">gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to</li>
<li class="L8467" rel="L8467">the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious</li>
<li class="L8468" rel="L8468">water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated</li>
<li class="L8469" rel="L8469">in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found</li>
<li class="L8470" rel="L8470">Elizabeth&#39;s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred</li>
<li class="L8471" rel="L8471">her husband&#39;s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on</li>
<li class="L8472" rel="L8472">together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him</li>
<li class="L8473" rel="L8473">to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the</li>
<li class="L8474" rel="L8474">place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been</li>
<li class="L8475" rel="L8475">very unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that</li>
<li class="L8476" rel="L8476">you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we</li>
<li class="L8477" rel="L8477">left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected</li>
<li class="L8478" rel="L8478">in the country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that</li>
<li class="L8479" rel="L8479">business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours</li>
<li class="L8480" rel="L8480">before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “They</li>
<li class="L8481" rel="L8481">will join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some</li>
<li class="L8482" rel="L8482">who will claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”</li>
<li class="L8483" rel="L8483"></li>
<li class="L8484" rel="L8484">Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly</li>
<li class="L8485" rel="L8485">driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley&#39;s name had been the last</li>
<li class="L8486" rel="L8486">mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, _his_</li>
<li class="L8487" rel="L8487">mind was not very differently engaged.</li>
<li class="L8488" rel="L8488"></li>
<li class="L8489" rel="L8489">“There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a</li>
<li class="L8490" rel="L8490">pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow</li>
<li class="L8491" rel="L8491">me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance</li>
<li class="L8492" rel="L8492">during your stay at Lambton?”</li>
<li class="L8493" rel="L8493"></li>
<li class="L8494" rel="L8494">The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great</li>
<li class="L8495" rel="L8495">for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt</li>
<li class="L8496" rel="L8496">that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her</li>
<li class="L8497" rel="L8497">must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was</li>
<li class="L8498" rel="L8498">satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made</li>
<li class="L8499" rel="L8499">him think really ill of her.</li>
<li class="L8500" rel="L8500"></li>
<li class="L8501" rel="L8501">They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth</li>
<li class="L8502" rel="L8502">was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and</li>
<li class="L8503" rel="L8503">pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of</li>
<li class="L8504" rel="L8504">the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had</li>
<li class="L8505" rel="L8505">reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a</li>
<li class="L8506" rel="L8506">mile behind.</li>
<li class="L8507" rel="L8507"></li>
<li class="L8508" rel="L8508">He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not</li>
<li class="L8509" rel="L8509">tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might</li>
<li class="L8510" rel="L8510">have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but</li>
<li class="L8511" rel="L8511">there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected</li>
<li class="L8512" rel="L8512">that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale</li>
<li class="L8513" rel="L8513">with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her</li>
<li class="L8514" rel="L8514">patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was</li>
<li class="L8515" rel="L8515">over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner&#39;s coming up they were all pressed to go</li>
<li class="L8516" rel="L8516">into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and</li>
<li class="L8517" rel="L8517">they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the</li>
<li class="L8518" rel="L8518">ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him</li>
<li class="L8519" rel="L8519">walking slowly towards the house.</li>
<li class="L8520" rel="L8520"></li>
<li class="L8521" rel="L8521">The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them</li>
<li class="L8522" rel="L8522">pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.</li>
<li class="L8523" rel="L8523">“He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.</li>
<li class="L8524" rel="L8524"></li>
<li class="L8525" rel="L8525">“There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her</li>
<li class="L8526" rel="L8526">aunt, “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now</li>
<li class="L8527" rel="L8527">say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I</li>
<li class="L8528" rel="L8528">have seen nothing of it.”</li>
<li class="L8529" rel="L8529"></li>
<li class="L8530" rel="L8530">“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more</li>
<li class="L8531" rel="L8531">than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such</li>
<li class="L8532" rel="L8532">attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”</li>
<li class="L8533" rel="L8533"></li>
<li class="L8534" rel="L8534">“To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham;</li>
<li class="L8535" rel="L8535">or, rather, he has not Wickham&#39;s countenance, for his features</li>
<li class="L8536" rel="L8536">are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so</li>
<li class="L8537" rel="L8537">disagreeable?”</li>
<li class="L8538" rel="L8538"></li>
<li class="L8539" rel="L8539">Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked</li>
<li class="L8540" rel="L8540">him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never</li>
<li class="L8541" rel="L8541">seen him so pleasant as this morning.</li>
<li class="L8542" rel="L8542"></li>
<li class="L8543" rel="L8543">“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied</li>
<li class="L8544" rel="L8544">her uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him</li>
<li class="L8545" rel="L8545">at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off</li>
<li class="L8546" rel="L8546">his grounds.”</li>
<li class="L8547" rel="L8547"></li>
<li class="L8548" rel="L8548">Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but</li>
<li class="L8549" rel="L8549">said nothing.</li>
<li class="L8550" rel="L8550"></li>
<li class="L8551" rel="L8551">“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really</li>
<li class="L8552" rel="L8552">should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by</li>
<li class="L8553" rel="L8553">anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.</li>
<li class="L8554" rel="L8554">On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he</li>
<li class="L8555" rel="L8555">speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would</li>
<li class="L8556" rel="L8556">not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the</li>
<li class="L8557" rel="L8557">good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!</li>
<li class="L8558" rel="L8558">I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal</li>
<li class="L8559" rel="L8559">master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every</li>
<li class="L8560" rel="L8560">virtue.”</li>
<li class="L8561" rel="L8561"></li>
<li class="L8562" rel="L8562">Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of</li>
<li class="L8563" rel="L8563">his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in</li>
<li class="L8564" rel="L8564">as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from</li>
<li class="L8565" rel="L8565">his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different</li>
<li class="L8566" rel="L8566">construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor</li>
<li class="L8567" rel="L8567">Wickham&#39;s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In</li>
<li class="L8568" rel="L8568">confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary</li>
<li class="L8569" rel="L8569">transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming</li>
<li class="L8570" rel="L8570">her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.</li>
<li class="L8571" rel="L8571"></li>
<li class="L8572" rel="L8572">Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now</li>
<li class="L8573" rel="L8573">approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to</li>
<li class="L8574" rel="L8574">the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out</li>
<li class="L8575" rel="L8575">to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of</li>
<li class="L8576" rel="L8576">anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning&#39;s walk they</li>
<li class="L8577" rel="L8577">had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former</li>
<li class="L8578" rel="L8578">acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a</li>
<li class="L8579" rel="L8579">intercourse renewed after many years&#39; discontinuance.</li>
<li class="L8580" rel="L8580"></li>
<li class="L8581" rel="L8581">The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth</li>
<li class="L8582" rel="L8582">much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing</li>
<li class="L8583" rel="L8583">but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy&#39;s civility, and, above</li>
<li class="L8584" rel="L8584">all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.</li>
<li class="L8585" rel="L8585"></li>
<li class="L8586" rel="L8586"></li>
<li class="L8587" rel="L8587"></li>
<li class="L8588" rel="L8588">Chapter 44</li>
<li class="L8589" rel="L8589"></li>
<li class="L8590" rel="L8590"></li>
<li class="L8591" rel="L8591">Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit</li>
<li class="L8592" rel="L8592">her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently</li>
<li class="L8593" rel="L8593">resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.</li>
<li class="L8594" rel="L8594">But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their</li>
<li class="L8595" rel="L8595">arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the</li>
<li class="L8596" rel="L8596">place with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn</li>
<li class="L8597" rel="L8597">to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a</li>
<li class="L8598" rel="L8598">carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in</li>
<li class="L8599" rel="L8599">a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing</li>
<li class="L8600" rel="L8600">the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her</li>
<li class="L8601" rel="L8601">surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she</li>
<li class="L8602" rel="L8602">expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment</li>
<li class="L8603" rel="L8603">of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many</li>
<li class="L8604" rel="L8604">of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on</li>
<li class="L8605" rel="L8605">the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that</li>
<li class="L8606" rel="L8606">there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a</li>
<li class="L8607" rel="L8607">quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these</li>
<li class="L8608" rel="L8608">newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of</li>
<li class="L8609" rel="L8609">Elizabeth&#39;s feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite</li>
<li class="L8610" rel="L8610">amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet,</li>
<li class="L8611" rel="L8611">she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much</li>
<li class="L8612" rel="L8612">in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally</li>
<li class="L8613" rel="L8613">suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.</li>
<li class="L8614" rel="L8614"></li>
<li class="L8615" rel="L8615">She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked</li>
<li class="L8616" rel="L8616">up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of</li>
<li class="L8617" rel="L8617">inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.</li>
<li class="L8618" rel="L8618"></li>
<li class="L8619" rel="L8619">Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction</li>
<li class="L8620" rel="L8620">took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new</li>
<li class="L8621" rel="L8621">acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her</li>
<li class="L8622" rel="L8622">being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;</li>
<li class="L8623" rel="L8623">but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was</li>
<li class="L8624" rel="L8624">only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from</li>
<li class="L8625" rel="L8625">her beyond a monosyllable.</li>
<li class="L8626" rel="L8626"></li>
<li class="L8627" rel="L8627">Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though</li>
<li class="L8628" rel="L8628">little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance</li>
<li class="L8629" rel="L8629">womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there</li>
<li class="L8630" rel="L8630">was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly</li>
<li class="L8631" rel="L8631">unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as</li>
<li class="L8632" rel="L8632">acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much</li>
<li class="L8633" rel="L8633">relieved by discerning such different feelings.</li>
<li class="L8634" rel="L8634"></li>
<li class="L8635" rel="L8635">They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley</li>
<li class="L8636" rel="L8636">was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her</li>
<li class="L8637" rel="L8637">satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley&#39;s quick</li>
<li class="L8638" rel="L8638">step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All</li>
<li class="L8639" rel="L8639">Elizabeth&#39;s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still</li>
<li class="L8640" rel="L8640">felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected</li>
<li class="L8641" rel="L8641">cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He</li>
<li class="L8642" rel="L8642">inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked</li>
<li class="L8643" rel="L8643">and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.</li>
<li class="L8644" rel="L8644"></li>
<li class="L8645" rel="L8645">To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage</li>
<li class="L8646" rel="L8646">than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before</li>
<li class="L8647" rel="L8647">them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just</li>
<li class="L8648" rel="L8648">arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards</li>
<li class="L8649" rel="L8649">each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from</li>
<li class="L8650" rel="L8650">those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew</li>
<li class="L8651" rel="L8651">what it was to love. Of the lady&#39;s sensations they remained a little</li>
<li class="L8652" rel="L8652">in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was</li>
<li class="L8653" rel="L8653">evident enough.</li>
<li class="L8654" rel="L8654"></li>
<li class="L8655" rel="L8655">Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the</li>
<li class="L8656" rel="L8656">feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and</li>
<li class="L8657" rel="L8657">to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she</li>
<li class="L8658" rel="L8658">feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she</li>
<li class="L8659" rel="L8659">endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley</li>
<li class="L8660" rel="L8660">was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.</li>
<li class="L8661" rel="L8661"></li>
<li class="L8662" rel="L8662">In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!</li>
<li class="L8663" rel="L8663">how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in</li>
<li class="L8664" rel="L8664">a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on</li>
<li class="L8665" rel="L8665">former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion</li>
<li class="L8666" rel="L8666">that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,</li>
<li class="L8667" rel="L8667">though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his</li>
<li class="L8668" rel="L8668">behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look</li>
<li class="L8669" rel="L8669">appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred</li>
<li class="L8670" rel="L8670">between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point</li>
<li class="L8671" rel="L8671">she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred</li>
<li class="L8672" rel="L8672">ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a</li>
<li class="L8673" rel="L8673">recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying</li>
<li class="L8674" rel="L8674">more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed</li>
<li class="L8675" rel="L8675">to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone</li>
<li class="L8676" rel="L8676">which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long time since</li>
<li class="L8677" rel="L8677">he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could reply,</li>
<li class="L8678" rel="L8678">he added, “It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of</li>
<li class="L8679" rel="L8679">November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.”</li>
<li class="L8680" rel="L8680"></li>
<li class="L8681" rel="L8681">Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards</li>
<li class="L8682" rel="L8682">took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether</li>
<li class="L8683" rel="L8683">_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,</li>
<li class="L8684" rel="L8684">nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which</li>
<li class="L8685" rel="L8685">gave them meaning.</li>
<li class="L8686" rel="L8686"></li>
<li class="L8687" rel="L8687">It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself;</li>
<li class="L8688" rel="L8688">but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general</li>
<li class="L8689" rel="L8689">complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed</li>
<li class="L8690" rel="L8690">from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that</li>
<li class="L8691" rel="L8691">the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however</li>
<li class="L8692" rel="L8692">temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When</li>
<li class="L8693" rel="L8693">she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion</li>
<li class="L8694" rel="L8694">of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a</li>
<li class="L8695" rel="L8695">disgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the</li>
<li class="L8696" rel="L8696">very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last</li>
<li class="L8697" rel="L8697">lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was</li>
<li class="L8698" rel="L8698">so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly</li>
<li class="L8699" rel="L8699">restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company</li>
<li class="L8700" rel="L8700">of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations</li>
<li class="L8701" rel="L8701">at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from</li>
<li class="L8702" rel="L8702">self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance</li>
<li class="L8703" rel="L8703">could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the</li>
<li class="L8704" rel="L8704">acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw</li>
<li class="L8705" rel="L8705">down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and</li>
<li class="L8706" rel="L8706">Rosings.</li>
<li class="L8707" rel="L8707"></li>
<li class="L8708" rel="L8708">Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose</li>
<li class="L8709" rel="L8709">to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing</li>
<li class="L8710" rel="L8710">their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner</li>
<li class="L8711" rel="L8711">at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a</li>
<li class="L8712" rel="L8712">diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,</li>
<li class="L8713" rel="L8713">readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing</li>
<li class="L8714" rel="L8714">how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its</li>
<li class="L8715" rel="L8715">acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however,</li>
<li class="L8716" rel="L8716">that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than</li>
<li class="L8717" rel="L8717">any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of</li>
<li class="L8718" rel="L8718">society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for</li>
<li class="L8719" rel="L8719">her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.</li>
<li class="L8720" rel="L8720"></li>
<li class="L8721" rel="L8721">Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth</li>
<li class="L8722" rel="L8722">again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to</li>
<li class="L8723" rel="L8723">make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all</li>
<li class="L8724" rel="L8724">this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on</li>
<li class="L8725" rel="L8725">this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their</li>
<li class="L8726" rel="L8726">visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some</li>
<li class="L8727" rel="L8727">satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been</li>
<li class="L8728" rel="L8728">little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her</li>
<li class="L8729" rel="L8729">uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their</li>
<li class="L8730" rel="L8730">favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.</li>
<li class="L8731" rel="L8731"></li>
<li class="L8732" rel="L8732">But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner&#39;s curiosity; it was</li>
<li class="L8733" rel="L8733">not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was</li>
<li class="L8734" rel="L8734">much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;</li>
<li class="L8735" rel="L8735">it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to</li>
<li class="L8736" rel="L8736">interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.</li>
<li class="L8737" rel="L8737"></li>
<li class="L8738" rel="L8738">Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far</li>
<li class="L8739" rel="L8739">as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could</li>
<li class="L8740" rel="L8740">not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character</li>
<li class="L8741" rel="L8741">from their own feelings and his servant&#39;s report, without any reference</li>
<li class="L8742" rel="L8742">to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known</li>
<li class="L8743" rel="L8743">would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,</li>
<li class="L8744" rel="L8744">however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible</li>
<li class="L8745" rel="L8745">that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four</li>
<li class="L8746" rel="L8746">years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be</li>
<li class="L8747" rel="L8747">hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of</li>
<li class="L8748" rel="L8748">their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had</li>
<li class="L8749" rel="L8749">nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,</li>
<li class="L8750" rel="L8750">it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town</li>
<li class="L8751" rel="L8751">where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he</li>
<li class="L8752" rel="L8752">was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.</li>
<li class="L8753" rel="L8753"></li>
<li class="L8754" rel="L8754">With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held</li>
<li class="L8755" rel="L8755">there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the</li>
<li class="L8756" rel="L8756">son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known</li>
<li class="L8757" rel="L8757">fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind</li>
<li class="L8758" rel="L8758">him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.</li>
<li class="L8759" rel="L8759"></li>
<li class="L8760" rel="L8760">As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than</li>
<li class="L8761" rel="L8761">the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not</li>
<li class="L8762" rel="L8762">long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion;</li>
<li class="L8763" rel="L8763">and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She</li>
<li class="L8764" rel="L8764">certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she</li>
<li class="L8765" rel="L8765">had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,</li>
<li class="L8766" rel="L8766">that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his</li>
<li class="L8767" rel="L8767">valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some</li>
<li class="L8768" rel="L8768">time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened</li>
<li class="L8769" rel="L8769">into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in</li>
<li class="L8770" rel="L8770">his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,</li>
<li class="L8771" rel="L8771">which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,</li>
<li class="L8772" rel="L8772">there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.</li>
<li class="L8773" rel="L8773">It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,</li>
<li class="L8774" rel="L8774">but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and</li>
<li class="L8775" rel="L8775">acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations</li>
<li class="L8776" rel="L8776">accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid</li>
<li class="L8777" rel="L8777">her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most</li>
<li class="L8778" rel="L8778">eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display</li>
<li class="L8779" rel="L8779">of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only</li>
<li class="L8780" rel="L8780">were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent</li>
<li class="L8781" rel="L8781">on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much</li>
<li class="L8782" rel="L8782">pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent</li>
<li class="L8783" rel="L8783">love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a</li>
<li class="L8784" rel="L8784">sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be</li>
<li class="L8785" rel="L8785">exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,</li>
<li class="L8786" rel="L8786">she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how</li>
<li class="L8787" rel="L8787">far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would</li>
<li class="L8788" rel="L8788">be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her</li>
<li class="L8789" rel="L8789">fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of</li>
<li class="L8790" rel="L8790">his addresses.</li>
<li class="L8791" rel="L8791"></li>
<li class="L8792" rel="L8792">It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that</li>
<li class="L8793" rel="L8793">such a striking civility as Miss Darcy&#39;s in coming to see them on the</li>
<li class="L8794" rel="L8794">very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a</li>
<li class="L8795" rel="L8795">late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled,</li>
<li class="L8796" rel="L8796">by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that</li>
<li class="L8797" rel="L8797">it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following</li>
<li class="L8798" rel="L8798">morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when</li>
<li class="L8799" rel="L8799">she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.</li>
<li class="L8800" rel="L8800"></li>
<li class="L8801" rel="L8801">Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been</li>
<li class="L8802" rel="L8802">renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting</li>
<li class="L8803" rel="L8803">some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.</li>
<li class="L8804" rel="L8804"></li>
<li class="L8805" rel="L8805"></li>
<li class="L8806" rel="L8806"></li>
<li class="L8807" rel="L8807">Chapter 45</li>
<li class="L8808" rel="L8808"></li>
<li class="L8809" rel="L8809"></li>
<li class="L8810" rel="L8810">Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley&#39;s dislike of her had</li>
<li class="L8811" rel="L8811">originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her</li>
<li class="L8812" rel="L8812">appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how</li>
<li class="L8813" rel="L8813">much civility on that lady&#39;s side the acquaintance would now be renewed.</li>
<li class="L8814" rel="L8814"></li>
<li class="L8815" rel="L8815">On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,</li>
<li class="L8816" rel="L8816">whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows</li>
<li class="L8817" rel="L8817">opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody</li>
<li class="L8818" rel="L8818">hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts</li>
<li class="L8819" rel="L8819">which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.</li>
<li class="L8820" rel="L8820"></li>
<li class="L8821" rel="L8821">In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there</li>
<li class="L8822" rel="L8822">with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in</li>
<li class="L8823" rel="L8823">London. Georgiana&#39;s reception of them was very civil, but attended with</li>
<li class="L8824" rel="L8824">all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear</li>
<li class="L8825" rel="L8825">of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior</li>
<li class="L8826" rel="L8826">the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,</li>
<li class="L8827" rel="L8827">however, did her justice, and pitied her.</li>
<li class="L8828" rel="L8828"></li>
<li class="L8829" rel="L8829">By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and,</li>
<li class="L8830" rel="L8830">on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,</li>
<li class="L8831" rel="L8831">succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a</li>
<li class="L8832" rel="L8832">genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind</li>
<li class="L8833" rel="L8833">of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the</li>
<li class="L8834" rel="L8834">others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from</li>
<li class="L8835" rel="L8835">Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she</li>
<li class="L8836" rel="L8836">wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a</li>
<li class="L8837" rel="L8837">short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.</li>
<li class="L8838" rel="L8838"></li>
<li class="L8839" rel="L8839">Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,</li>
<li class="L8840" rel="L8840">and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without</li>
<li class="L8841" rel="L8841">calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her</li>
<li class="L8842" rel="L8842">from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an</li>
<li class="L8843" rel="L8843">inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity</li>
<li class="L8844" rel="L8844">of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every</li>
<li class="L8845" rel="L8845">moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she</li>
<li class="L8846" rel="L8846">feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether</li>
<li class="L8847" rel="L8847">she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After</li>
<li class="L8848" rel="L8848">sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss</li>
<li class="L8849" rel="L8849">Bingley&#39;s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold</li>
<li class="L8850" rel="L8850">inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal</li>
<li class="L8851" rel="L8851">indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.</li>
<li class="L8852" rel="L8852"></li>
<li class="L8853" rel="L8853">The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the</li>
<li class="L8854" rel="L8854">entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the</li>
<li class="L8855" rel="L8855">finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many</li>
<li class="L8856" rel="L8856">a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been</li>
<li class="L8857" rel="L8857">given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole</li>
<li class="L8858" rel="L8858">party--for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the</li>
<li class="L8859" rel="L8859">beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected</li>
<li class="L8860" rel="L8860">them round the table.</li>
<li class="L8861" rel="L8861"></li>
<li class="L8862" rel="L8862">While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether</li>
<li class="L8863" rel="L8863">she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the</li>
<li class="L8864" rel="L8864">feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but</li>
<li class="L8865" rel="L8865">a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to</li>
<li class="L8866" rel="L8866">regret that he came.</li>
<li class="L8867" rel="L8867"></li>
<li class="L8868" rel="L8868">He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other</li>
<li class="L8869" rel="L8869">gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him</li>
<li class="L8870" rel="L8870">only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to</li>
<li class="L8871" rel="L8871">Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely</li>
<li class="L8872" rel="L8872">resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more</li>
<li class="L8873" rel="L8873">necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she</li>
<li class="L8874" rel="L8874">saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,</li>
<li class="L8875" rel="L8875">and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour</li>
<li class="L8876" rel="L8876">when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive</li>
<li class="L8877" rel="L8877">curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley&#39;s, in spite of the</li>
<li class="L8878" rel="L8878">smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its</li>
<li class="L8879" rel="L8879">objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions</li>
<li class="L8880" rel="L8880">to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother&#39;s</li>
<li class="L8881" rel="L8881">entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he</li>
<li class="L8882" rel="L8882">was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded</li>
<li class="L8883" rel="L8883">as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss</li>
<li class="L8884" rel="L8884">Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the</li>
<li class="L8885" rel="L8885">first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:</li>
<li class="L8886" rel="L8886"></li>
<li class="L8887" rel="L8887">“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from Meryton?</li>
<li class="L8888" rel="L8888">They must be a great loss to _your_ family.”</li>
<li class="L8889" rel="L8889"></li>
<li class="L8890" rel="L8890">In Darcy&#39;s presence she dared not mention Wickham&#39;s name; but Elizabeth</li>
<li class="L8891" rel="L8891">instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the</li>
<li class="L8892" rel="L8892">various recollections connected with him gave her a moment&#39;s distress;</li>
<li class="L8893" rel="L8893">but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she</li>
<li class="L8894" rel="L8894">presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While</li>
<li class="L8895" rel="L8895">she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened</li>
<li class="L8896" rel="L8896">complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with</li>
<li class="L8897" rel="L8897">confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what</li>
<li class="L8898" rel="L8898">pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would</li>
<li class="L8899" rel="L8899">have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose</li>
<li class="L8900" rel="L8900">Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed</li>
<li class="L8901" rel="L8901">her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in</li>
<li class="L8902" rel="L8902">Darcy&#39;s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies</li>
<li class="L8903" rel="L8903">and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected</li>
<li class="L8904" rel="L8904">with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy&#39;s</li>
<li class="L8905" rel="L8905">meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy</li>
<li class="L8906" rel="L8906">was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley&#39;s connections</li>
<li class="L8907" rel="L8907">her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very</li>
<li class="L8908" rel="L8908">wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming</li>
<li class="L8909" rel="L8909">hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without</li>
<li class="L8910" rel="L8910">meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss</li>
<li class="L8911" rel="L8911">Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern</li>
<li class="L8912" rel="L8912">for the welfare of his friend.</li>
<li class="L8913" rel="L8913"></li>
<li class="L8914" rel="L8914">Elizabeth&#39;s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and</li>
<li class="L8915" rel="L8915">as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to</li>
<li class="L8916" rel="L8916">Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able</li>
<li class="L8917" rel="L8917">to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely</li>
<li class="L8918" rel="L8918">recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which</li>
<li class="L8919" rel="L8919">had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have</li>
<li class="L8920" rel="L8920">fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.</li>
<li class="L8921" rel="L8921"></li>
<li class="L8922" rel="L8922">Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above</li>
<li class="L8923" rel="L8923">mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss</li>
<li class="L8924" rel="L8924">Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth&#39;s person,</li>
<li class="L8925" rel="L8925">behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother&#39;s</li>
<li class="L8926" rel="L8926">recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not</li>
<li class="L8927" rel="L8927">err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana</li>
<li class="L8928" rel="L8928">without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When</li>
<li class="L8929" rel="L8929">Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to</li>
<li class="L8930" rel="L8930">him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.</li>
<li class="L8931" rel="L8931"></li>
<li class="L8932" rel="L8932">“How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,” she</li>
<li class="L8933" rel="L8933">cried; “I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since</li>
<li class="L8934" rel="L8934">the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing</li>
<li class="L8935" rel="L8935">that we should not have known her again.”</li>
<li class="L8936" rel="L8936"></li>
<li class="L8937" rel="L8937">However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented</li>
<li class="L8938" rel="L8938">himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than</li>
<li class="L8939" rel="L8939">her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the</li>
<li class="L8940" rel="L8940">summer.</li>
<li class="L8941" rel="L8941"></li>
<li class="L8942" rel="L8942">“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could</li>
<li class="L8943" rel="L8943">see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no</li>
<li class="L8944" rel="L8944">brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose</li>
<li class="L8945" rel="L8945">wants character--there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are</li>
<li class="L8946" rel="L8946">tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes,</li>
<li class="L8947" rel="L8947">which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything</li>
<li class="L8948" rel="L8948">extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do</li>
<li class="L8949" rel="L8949">not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency</li>
<li class="L8950" rel="L8950">without fashion, which is intolerable.”</li>
<li class="L8951" rel="L8951"></li>
<li class="L8952" rel="L8952">Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not</li>
<li class="L8953" rel="L8953">the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always</li>
<li class="L8954" rel="L8954">wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the</li>
<li class="L8955" rel="L8955">success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a</li>
<li class="L8956" rel="L8956">determination of making him speak, she continued:</li>
<li class="L8957" rel="L8957"></li>
<li class="L8958" rel="L8958">“I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all</li>
<li class="L8959" rel="L8959">were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect</li>
<li class="L8960" rel="L8960">your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, &#39;_She_</li>
<li class="L8961" rel="L8961">a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.&#39; But afterwards she</li>
<li class="L8962" rel="L8962">seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at</li>
<li class="L8963" rel="L8963">one time.”</li>
<li class="L8964" rel="L8964"></li>
<li class="L8965" rel="L8965">“Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but _that_</li>
<li class="L8966" rel="L8966">was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have</li>
<li class="L8967" rel="L8967">considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”</li>
<li class="L8968" rel="L8968"></li>
<li class="L8969" rel="L8969">He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of</li>
<li class="L8970" rel="L8970">having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.</li>
<li class="L8971" rel="L8971"></li>
<li class="L8972" rel="L8972">Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their</li>
<li class="L8973" rel="L8973">visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them</li>
<li class="L8974" rel="L8974">both. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,</li>
<li class="L8975" rel="L8975">except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked</li>
<li class="L8976" rel="L8976">of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--of everything but</li>
<li class="L8977" rel="L8977">himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of</li>
<li class="L8978" rel="L8978">him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece&#39;s</li>
<li class="L8979" rel="L8979">beginning the subject.</li>
<li class="L8980" rel="L8980"></li>
<li class="L8981" rel="L8981"></li>
<li class="L8982" rel="L8982"></li>
<li class="L8983" rel="L8983">Chapter 46</li>
<li class="L8984" rel="L8984"></li>
<li class="L8985" rel="L8985"></li>
<li class="L8986" rel="L8986">Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from</li>
<li class="L8987" rel="L8987">Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been</li>
<li class="L8988" rel="L8988">renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but</li>
<li class="L8989" rel="L8989">on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the</li>
<li class="L8990" rel="L8990">receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that</li>
<li class="L8991" rel="L8991">it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as</li>
<li class="L8992" rel="L8992">Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.</li>
<li class="L8993" rel="L8993"></li>
<li class="L8994" rel="L8994">They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and</li>
<li class="L8995" rel="L8995">her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by</li>
<li class="L8996" rel="L8996">themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had been</li>
<li class="L8997" rel="L8997">written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their</li>
<li class="L8998" rel="L8998">little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;</li>
<li class="L8999" rel="L8999">but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident</li>
<li class="L9000" rel="L9000">agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:</li>
<li class="L9001" rel="L9001"></li>
<li class="L9002" rel="L9002">“Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a</li>
<li class="L9003" rel="L9003">most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be</li>
<li class="L9004" rel="L9004">assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.</li>
<li class="L9005" rel="L9005">An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,</li>
<li class="L9006" rel="L9006">from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland</li>
<li class="L9007" rel="L9007">with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our</li>
<li class="L9008" rel="L9008">surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am</li>
<li class="L9009" rel="L9009">very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing</li>
<li class="L9010" rel="L9010">to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.</li>
<li class="L9011" rel="L9011">Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step</li>
<li class="L9012" rel="L9012">(and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is</li>
<li class="L9013" rel="L9013">disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.</li>
<li class="L9014" rel="L9014">Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How</li>
<li class="L9015" rel="L9015">thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against</li>
<li class="L9016" rel="L9016">him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about</li>
<li class="L9017" rel="L9017">twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at</li>
<li class="L9018" rel="L9018">eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have</li>
<li class="L9019" rel="L9019">passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect</li>
<li class="L9020" rel="L9020">him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of</li>
<li class="L9021" rel="L9021">their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor</li>
<li class="L9022" rel="L9022">mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly</li>
<li class="L9023" rel="L9023">know what I have written.”</li>
<li class="L9024" rel="L9024"></li>
<li class="L9025" rel="L9025">Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing</li>
<li class="L9026" rel="L9026">what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the</li>
<li class="L9027" rel="L9027">other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it</li>
<li class="L9028" rel="L9028">had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.</li>
<li class="L9029" rel="L9029"></li>
<li class="L9030" rel="L9030">“By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I</li>
<li class="L9031" rel="L9031">wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my</li>
<li class="L9032" rel="L9032">head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest</li>
<li class="L9033" rel="L9033">Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,</li>
<li class="L9034" rel="L9034">and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham</li>
<li class="L9035" rel="L9035">and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has</li>
<li class="L9036" rel="L9036">taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone</li>
<li class="L9037" rel="L9037">to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the</li>
<li class="L9038" rel="L9038">day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia&#39;s short</li>
<li class="L9039" rel="L9039">letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna</li>
<li class="L9040" rel="L9040">Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.</li>
<li class="L9041" rel="L9041">never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was</li>
<li class="L9042" rel="L9042">repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.</li>
<li class="L9043" rel="L9043">intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham,</li>
<li class="L9044" rel="L9044">but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney</li>
<li class="L9045" rel="L9045">coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that</li>
<li class="L9046" rel="L9046">is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.</li>
<li class="L9047" rel="L9047">I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that</li>
<li class="L9048" rel="L9048">side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing</li>
<li class="L9049" rel="L9049">them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but</li>
<li class="L9050" rel="L9050">without any success--no such people had been seen to pass through. With</li>
<li class="L9051" rel="L9051">the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions</li>
<li class="L9052" rel="L9052">to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved</li>
<li class="L9053" rel="L9053">for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our</li>
<li class="L9054" rel="L9054">distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the</li>
<li class="L9055" rel="L9055">worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make</li>
<li class="L9056" rel="L9056">it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue</li>
<li class="L9057" rel="L9057">their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a</li>
<li class="L9058" rel="L9058">young woman of Lydia&#39;s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose</li>
<li class="L9059" rel="L9059">her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that</li>
<li class="L9060" rel="L9060">Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his</li>
<li class="L9061" rel="L9061">head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to</li>
<li class="L9062" rel="L9062">be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she</li>
<li class="L9063" rel="L9063">exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And</li>
<li class="L9064" rel="L9064">as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has</li>
<li class="L9065" rel="L9065">anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of</li>
<li class="L9066" rel="L9066">confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you</li>
<li class="L9067" rel="L9067">have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the</li>
<li class="L9068" rel="L9068">first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not</li>
<li class="L9069" rel="L9069">so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I</li>
<li class="L9070" rel="L9070">take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but</li>
<li class="L9071" rel="L9071">circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to</li>
<li class="L9072" rel="L9072">come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well,</li>
<li class="L9073" rel="L9073">that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something</li>
<li class="L9074" rel="L9074">more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel</li>
<li class="L9075" rel="L9075">Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure</li>
<li class="L9076" rel="L9076">I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any</li>
<li class="L9077" rel="L9077">measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to</li>
<li class="L9078" rel="L9078">be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my</li>
<li class="L9079" rel="L9079">uncle&#39;s advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will</li>
<li class="L9080" rel="L9080">immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”</li>
<li class="L9081" rel="L9081"></li>
<li class="L9082" rel="L9082">“Oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat</li>
<li class="L9083" rel="L9083">as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing</li>
<li class="L9084" rel="L9084">a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was</li>
<li class="L9085" rel="L9085">opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous</li>
<li class="L9086" rel="L9086">manner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak,</li>
<li class="L9087" rel="L9087">she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia&#39;s situation,</li>
<li class="L9088" rel="L9088">hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find</li>
<li class="L9089" rel="L9089">Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not</li>
<li class="L9090" rel="L9090">an instant to lose.”</li>
<li class="L9091" rel="L9091"></li>
<li class="L9092" rel="L9092">“Good God! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than</li>
<li class="L9093" rel="L9093">politeness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a minute;</li>
<li class="L9094" rel="L9094">but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are</li>
<li class="L9095" rel="L9095">not well enough; you cannot go yourself.”</li>
<li class="L9096" rel="L9096"></li>
<li class="L9097" rel="L9097">Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how</li>
<li class="L9098" rel="L9098">little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back</li>
<li class="L9099" rel="L9099">the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless</li>
<li class="L9100" rel="L9100">an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and</li>
<li class="L9101" rel="L9101">mistress home instantly.</li>
<li class="L9102" rel="L9102"></li>
<li class="L9103" rel="L9103">On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and</li>
<li class="L9104" rel="L9104">looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,</li>
<li class="L9105" rel="L9105">or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,</li>
<li class="L9106" rel="L9106">“Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you</li>
<li class="L9107" rel="L9107">present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.”</li>
<li class="L9108" rel="L9108"></li>
<li class="L9109" rel="L9109">“No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “There</li>
<li class="L9110" rel="L9110">is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by</li>
<li class="L9111" rel="L9111">some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.”</li>
<li class="L9112" rel="L9112"></li>
<li class="L9113" rel="L9113">She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could</li>
<li class="L9114" rel="L9114">not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say</li>
<li class="L9115" rel="L9115">something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate</li>
<li class="L9116" rel="L9116">silence. At length she spoke again. “I have just had a letter from Jane,</li>
<li class="L9117" rel="L9117">with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger</li>
<li class="L9118" rel="L9118">sister has left all her friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into</li>
<li class="L9119" rel="L9119">the power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton.</li>
<li class="L9120" rel="L9120">_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no</li>
<li class="L9121" rel="L9121">connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.”</li>
<li class="L9122" rel="L9122"></li>
<li class="L9123" rel="L9123">Darcy was fixed in astonishment. “When I consider,” she added in a yet</li>
<li class="L9124" rel="L9124">more agitated voice, “that I might have prevented it! I, who knew what</li>
<li class="L9125" rel="L9125">he was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I</li>
<li class="L9126" rel="L9126">learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not</li>
<li class="L9127" rel="L9127">have happened. But it is all--all too late now.”</li>
<li class="L9128" rel="L9128"></li>
<li class="L9129" rel="L9129">“I am grieved indeed,” cried Darcy; “grieved--shocked. But is it</li>
<li class="L9130" rel="L9130">certain--absolutely certain?”</li>
<li class="L9131" rel="L9131"></li>
<li class="L9132" rel="L9132">“Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced</li>
<li class="L9133" rel="L9133">almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to</li>
<li class="L9134" rel="L9134">Scotland.”</li>
<li class="L9135" rel="L9135"></li>
<li class="L9136" rel="L9136">“And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?”</li>
<li class="L9137" rel="L9137"></li>
<li class="L9138" rel="L9138">“My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle&#39;s</li>
<li class="L9139" rel="L9139">immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But</li>
<li class="L9140" rel="L9140">nothing can be done--I know very well that nothing can be done. How is</li>
<li class="L9141" rel="L9141">such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have</li>
<li class="L9142" rel="L9142">not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!”</li>
<li class="L9143" rel="L9143"></li>
<li class="L9144" rel="L9144">Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.</li>
<li class="L9145" rel="L9145"></li>
<li class="L9146" rel="L9146">“When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character--Oh! had I known what</li>
<li class="L9147" rel="L9147">I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too</li>
<li class="L9148" rel="L9148">much. Wretched, wretched mistake!”</li>
<li class="L9149" rel="L9149"></li>
<li class="L9150" rel="L9150">Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking</li>
<li class="L9151" rel="L9151">up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air</li>
<li class="L9152" rel="L9152">gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her</li>
<li class="L9153" rel="L9153">power was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family</li>
<li class="L9154" rel="L9154">weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither</li>
<li class="L9155" rel="L9155">wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing</li>
<li class="L9156" rel="L9156">consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It</li>
<li class="L9157" rel="L9157">was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own</li>
<li class="L9158" rel="L9158">wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved</li>
<li class="L9159" rel="L9159">him, as now, when all love must be vain.</li>
<li class="L9160" rel="L9160"></li>
<li class="L9161" rel="L9161">But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the</li>
<li class="L9162" rel="L9162">humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed</li>
<li class="L9163" rel="L9163">up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,</li>
<li class="L9164" rel="L9164">Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of</li>
<li class="L9165" rel="L9165">several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by</li>
<li class="L9166" rel="L9166">the voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke</li>
<li class="L9167" rel="L9167">compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, “I am afraid you have been</li>
<li class="L9168" rel="L9168">long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my</li>
<li class="L9169" rel="L9169">stay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything</li>
<li class="L9170" rel="L9170">could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to</li>
<li class="L9171" rel="L9171">such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may</li>
<li class="L9172" rel="L9172">seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I</li>
<li class="L9173" rel="L9173">fear, prevent my sister&#39;s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley</li>
<li class="L9174" rel="L9174">to-day.”</li>
<li class="L9175" rel="L9175"></li>
<li class="L9176" rel="L9176">“Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that</li>
<li class="L9177" rel="L9177">urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as</li>
<li class="L9178" rel="L9178">long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.”</li>
<li class="L9179" rel="L9179"></li>
<li class="L9180" rel="L9180">He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for</li>
<li class="L9181" rel="L9181">her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present</li>
<li class="L9182" rel="L9182">reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only</li>
<li class="L9183" rel="L9183">one serious, parting look, went away.</li>
<li class="L9184" rel="L9184"></li>
<li class="L9185" rel="L9185">As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they</li>
<li class="L9186" rel="L9186">should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as</li>
<li class="L9187" rel="L9187">had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a</li>
<li class="L9188" rel="L9188">retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full</li>
<li class="L9189" rel="L9189">of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those</li>
<li class="L9190" rel="L9190">feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would</li>
<li class="L9191" rel="L9191">formerly have rejoiced in its termination.</li>
<li class="L9192" rel="L9192"></li>
<li class="L9193" rel="L9193">If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth&#39;s</li>
<li class="L9194" rel="L9194">change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if</li>
<li class="L9195" rel="L9195">otherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or</li>
<li class="L9196" rel="L9196">unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on</li>
<li class="L9197" rel="L9197">a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been</li>
<li class="L9198" rel="L9198">exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given</li>
<li class="L9199" rel="L9199">somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham,</li>
<li class="L9200" rel="L9200">and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other</li>
<li class="L9201" rel="L9201">less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him</li>
<li class="L9202" rel="L9202">go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia&#39;s infamy must</li>
<li class="L9203" rel="L9203">produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched</li>
<li class="L9204" rel="L9204">business. Never, since reading Jane&#39;s second letter, had she entertained</li>
<li class="L9205" rel="L9205">a hope of Wickham&#39;s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,</li>
<li class="L9206" rel="L9206">could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least</li>
<li class="L9207" rel="L9207">of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first</li>
<li class="L9208" rel="L9208">letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that</li>
<li class="L9209" rel="L9209">Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry</li>
<li class="L9210" rel="L9210">for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared</li>
<li class="L9211" rel="L9211">incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment</li>
<li class="L9212" rel="L9212">as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose</li>
<li class="L9213" rel="L9213">Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention</li>
<li class="L9214" rel="L9214">of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue</li>
<li class="L9215" rel="L9215">nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.</li>
<li class="L9216" rel="L9216"></li>
<li class="L9217" rel="L9217">She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that</li>
<li class="L9218" rel="L9218">Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia</li>
<li class="L9219" rel="L9219">wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one</li>
<li class="L9220" rel="L9220">officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions</li>
<li class="L9221" rel="L9221">raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been</li>
<li class="L9222" rel="L9222">fluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and</li>
<li class="L9223" rel="L9223">mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now</li>
<li class="L9224" rel="L9224">feel it!</li>
<li class="L9225" rel="L9225"></li>
<li class="L9226" rel="L9226">She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to</li>
<li class="L9227" rel="L9227">share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a</li>
<li class="L9228" rel="L9228">family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and</li>
<li class="L9229" rel="L9229">requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing</li>
<li class="L9230" rel="L9230">could be done for Lydia, her uncle&#39;s interference seemed of the utmost</li>
<li class="L9231" rel="L9231">importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr.</li>
<li class="L9232" rel="L9232">and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant&#39;s</li>
<li class="L9233" rel="L9233">account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them</li>
<li class="L9234" rel="L9234">instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their</li>
<li class="L9235" rel="L9235">summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript</li>
<li class="L9236" rel="L9236">of the last with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had never been a</li>
<li class="L9237" rel="L9237">favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply</li>
<li class="L9238" rel="L9238">afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the</li>
<li class="L9239" rel="L9239">first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every</li>
<li class="L9240" rel="L9240">assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked</li>
<li class="L9241" rel="L9241">him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit,</li>
<li class="L9242" rel="L9242">everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to</li>
<li class="L9243" rel="L9243">be off as soon as possible. “But what is to be done about Pemberley?”</li>
<li class="L9244" rel="L9244"> cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for</li>
<li class="L9245" rel="L9245">us; was it so?”</li>
<li class="L9246" rel="L9246"></li>
<li class="L9247" rel="L9247">“Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.</li>
<li class="L9248" rel="L9248">_That_ is all settled.”</li>
<li class="L9249" rel="L9249"></li>
<li class="L9250" rel="L9250">“What is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to</li>
<li class="L9251" rel="L9251">prepare. “And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real</li>
<li class="L9252" rel="L9252">truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!”</li>
<li class="L9253" rel="L9253"></li>
<li class="L9254" rel="L9254">But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the</li>
<li class="L9255" rel="L9255">hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure</li>
<li class="L9256" rel="L9256">to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was</li>
<li class="L9257" rel="L9257">impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of</li>
<li class="L9258" rel="L9258">business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to</li>
<li class="L9259" rel="L9259">be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their</li>
<li class="L9260" rel="L9260">sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.</li>
<li class="L9261" rel="L9261">Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing</li>
<li class="L9262" rel="L9262">remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of</li>
<li class="L9263" rel="L9263">the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could</li>
<li class="L9264" rel="L9264">have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.</li>
<li class="L9265" rel="L9265"></li>
<li class="L9266" rel="L9266"></li>
<li class="L9267" rel="L9267"></li>
<li class="L9268" rel="L9268">Chapter 47</li>
<li class="L9269" rel="L9269"></li>
<li class="L9270" rel="L9270"></li>
<li class="L9271" rel="L9271">“I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they</li>
<li class="L9272" rel="L9272">drove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I am much</li>
<li class="L9273" rel="L9273">more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the</li>
<li class="L9274" rel="L9274">matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should</li>
<li class="L9275" rel="L9275">form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or</li>
<li class="L9276" rel="L9276">friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel&#39;s family, that I</li>
<li class="L9277" rel="L9277">am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends</li>
<li class="L9278" rel="L9278">would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the</li>
<li class="L9279" rel="L9279">regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is</li>
<li class="L9280" rel="L9280">not adequate to the risk!”</li>
<li class="L9281" rel="L9281"></li>
<li class="L9282" rel="L9282">“Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.</li>
<li class="L9283" rel="L9283"></li>
<li class="L9284" rel="L9284">“Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle&#39;s</li>
<li class="L9285" rel="L9285">opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and</li>
<li class="L9286" rel="L9286">interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of</li>
<li class="L9287" rel="L9287">Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe</li>
<li class="L9288" rel="L9288">him capable of it?”</li>
<li class="L9289" rel="L9289"></li>
<li class="L9290" rel="L9290">“Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other</li>
<li class="L9291" rel="L9291">neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I</li>
<li class="L9292" rel="L9292">dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been</li>
<li class="L9293" rel="L9293">the case?”</li>
<li class="L9294" rel="L9294"></li>
<li class="L9295" rel="L9295">“In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof</li>
<li class="L9296" rel="L9296">that they are not gone to Scotland.”</li>
<li class="L9297" rel="L9297"></li>
<li class="L9298" rel="L9298">“Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such</li>
<li class="L9299" rel="L9299">a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the</li>
<li class="L9300" rel="L9300">Barnet road.”</li>
<li class="L9301" rel="L9301"></li>
<li class="L9302" rel="L9302">“Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though</li>
<li class="L9303" rel="L9303">for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is</li>
<li class="L9304" rel="L9304">not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it</li>
<li class="L9305" rel="L9305">might strike them that they could be more economically, though less</li>
<li class="L9306" rel="L9306">expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.”</li>
<li class="L9307" rel="L9307"></li>
<li class="L9308" rel="L9308">“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their</li>
<li class="L9309" rel="L9309">marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular</li>
<li class="L9310" rel="L9310">friend, you see by Jane&#39;s account, was persuaded of his never intending</li>
<li class="L9311" rel="L9311">to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He</li>
<li class="L9312" rel="L9312">cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she</li>
<li class="L9313" rel="L9313">beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake,</li>
<li class="L9314" rel="L9314">forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what</li>
<li class="L9315" rel="L9315">restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a</li>
<li class="L9316" rel="L9316">dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know</li>
<li class="L9317" rel="L9317">nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your</li>
<li class="L9318" rel="L9318">other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has</li>
<li class="L9319" rel="L9319">no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father&#39;s</li>
<li class="L9320" rel="L9320">behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever</li>
<li class="L9321" rel="L9321">seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would</li>
<li class="L9322" rel="L9322">do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in</li>
<li class="L9323" rel="L9323">such a matter.”</li>
<li class="L9324" rel="L9324"></li>
<li class="L9325" rel="L9325">“But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him</li>
<li class="L9326" rel="L9326">as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?”</li>
<li class="L9327" rel="L9327"></li>
<li class="L9328" rel="L9328">“It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,” replied Elizabeth, with</li>
<li class="L9329" rel="L9329">tears in her eyes, “that a sister&#39;s sense of decency and virtue in such</li>
<li class="L9330" rel="L9330">a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.</li>
<li class="L9331" rel="L9331">Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never</li>
<li class="L9332" rel="L9332">been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year,</li>
<li class="L9333" rel="L9333">nay, for a twelvemonth--she has been given up to nothing but amusement</li>
<li class="L9334" rel="L9334">and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle</li>
<li class="L9335" rel="L9335">and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.</li>
<li class="L9336" rel="L9336">Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,</li>
<li class="L9337" rel="L9337">flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing</li>
<li class="L9338" rel="L9338">everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give</li>
<li class="L9339" rel="L9339">greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are</li>
<li class="L9340" rel="L9340">naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of</li>
<li class="L9341" rel="L9341">person and address that can captivate a woman.”</li>
<li class="L9342" rel="L9342"></li>
<li class="L9343" rel="L9343">“But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so very ill of</li>
<li class="L9344" rel="L9344">Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.”</li>
<li class="L9345" rel="L9345"></li>
<li class="L9346" rel="L9346">“Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be</li>
<li class="L9347" rel="L9347">their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt,</li>
<li class="L9348" rel="L9348">till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what</li>
<li class="L9349" rel="L9349">Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every</li>
<li class="L9350" rel="L9350">sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is</li>
<li class="L9351" rel="L9351">as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.”</li>
<li class="L9352" rel="L9352"></li>
<li class="L9353" rel="L9353">“And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity</li>
<li class="L9354" rel="L9354">as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.</li>
<li class="L9355" rel="L9355"></li>
<li class="L9356" rel="L9356">“I do indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you, the other day,</li>
<li class="L9357" rel="L9357">of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at</li>
<li class="L9358" rel="L9358">Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved</li>
<li class="L9359" rel="L9359">with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other</li>
<li class="L9360" rel="L9360">circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to</li>
<li class="L9361" rel="L9361">relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From</li>
<li class="L9362" rel="L9362">what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,</li>
<li class="L9363" rel="L9363">reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He</li>
<li class="L9364" rel="L9364">must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found</li>
<li class="L9365" rel="L9365">her.”</li>
<li class="L9366" rel="L9366"></li>
<li class="L9367" rel="L9367">“But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you</li>
<li class="L9368" rel="L9368">and Jane seem so well to understand?”</li>
<li class="L9369" rel="L9369"></li>
<li class="L9370" rel="L9370">“Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw</li>
<li class="L9371" rel="L9371">so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was</li>
<li class="L9372" rel="L9372">ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ----shire</li>
<li class="L9373" rel="L9373">was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight&#39;s time. As that was the</li>
<li class="L9374" rel="L9374">case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it</li>
<li class="L9375" rel="L9375">necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could</li>
<li class="L9376" rel="L9376">it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the</li>
<li class="L9377" rel="L9377">neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was</li>
<li class="L9378" rel="L9378">settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening</li>
<li class="L9379" rel="L9379">her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be</li>
<li class="L9380" rel="L9380">in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a</li>
<li class="L9381" rel="L9381">consequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was far</li>
<li class="L9382" rel="L9382">enough from my thoughts.”</li>
<li class="L9383" rel="L9383"></li>
<li class="L9384" rel="L9384">“When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I</li>
<li class="L9385" rel="L9385">suppose, to believe them fond of each other?”</li>
<li class="L9386" rel="L9386"></li>
<li class="L9387" rel="L9387">“Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either</li>
<li class="L9388" rel="L9388">side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware</li>
<li class="L9389" rel="L9389">that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first</li>
<li class="L9390" rel="L9390">he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all</li>
<li class="L9391" rel="L9391">were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for</li>
<li class="L9392" rel="L9392">the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular</li>
<li class="L9393" rel="L9393">attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and</li>
<li class="L9394" rel="L9394">wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,</li>
<li class="L9395" rel="L9395">who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”</li>
<li class="L9396" rel="L9396"></li>
<li class="L9397" rel="L9397">                          * * * * *</li>
<li class="L9398" rel="L9398"></li>
<li class="L9399" rel="L9399">It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added</li>
<li class="L9400" rel="L9400">to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by</li>
<li class="L9401" rel="L9401">its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during</li>
<li class="L9402" rel="L9402">the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth&#39;s thoughts it was never absent.</li>
<li class="L9403" rel="L9403">Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find</li>
<li class="L9404" rel="L9404">no interval of ease or forgetfulness.</li>
<li class="L9405" rel="L9405"></li>
<li class="L9406" rel="L9406">They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night</li>
<li class="L9407" rel="L9407">on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a</li>
<li class="L9408" rel="L9408">comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied</li>
<li class="L9409" rel="L9409">by long expectations.</li>
<li class="L9410" rel="L9410"></li>
<li class="L9411" rel="L9411">The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing</li>
<li class="L9412" rel="L9412">on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the</li>
<li class="L9413" rel="L9413">carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their</li>
<li class="L9414" rel="L9414">faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of</li>
<li class="L9415" rel="L9415">capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.</li>
<li class="L9416" rel="L9416"></li>
<li class="L9417" rel="L9417">Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss,</li>
<li class="L9418" rel="L9418">hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her</li>
<li class="L9419" rel="L9419">mother&#39;s apartment, immediately met her.</li>
<li class="L9420" rel="L9420"></li>
<li class="L9421" rel="L9421">Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the</li>
<li class="L9422" rel="L9422">eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been</li>
<li class="L9423" rel="L9423">heard of the fugitives.</li>
<li class="L9424" rel="L9424"></li>
<li class="L9425" rel="L9425">“Not yet,” replied Jane. “But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope</li>
<li class="L9426" rel="L9426">everything will be well.”</li>
<li class="L9427" rel="L9427"></li>
<li class="L9428" rel="L9428">“Is my father in town?”</li>
<li class="L9429" rel="L9429"></li>
<li class="L9430" rel="L9430">“Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”</li>
<li class="L9431" rel="L9431"></li>
<li class="L9432" rel="L9432">“And have you heard from him often?”</li>
<li class="L9433" rel="L9433"></li>
<li class="L9434" rel="L9434">“We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say</li>
<li class="L9435" rel="L9435">that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I</li>
<li class="L9436" rel="L9436">particularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write</li>
<li class="L9437" rel="L9437">again till he had something of importance to mention.”</li>
<li class="L9438" rel="L9438"></li>
<li class="L9439" rel="L9439">“And my mother--how is she? How are you all?”</li>
<li class="L9440" rel="L9440"></li>
<li class="L9441" rel="L9441">“My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly</li>
<li class="L9442" rel="L9442">shaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you</li>
<li class="L9443" rel="L9443">all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank</li>
<li class="L9444" rel="L9444">Heaven, are quite well.”</li>
<li class="L9445" rel="L9445"></li>
<li class="L9446" rel="L9446">“But you--how are you?” cried Elizabeth. “You look pale. How much you</li>
<li class="L9447" rel="L9447">must have gone through!”</li>
<li class="L9448" rel="L9448"></li>
<li class="L9449" rel="L9449">Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their</li>
<li class="L9450" rel="L9450">conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were</li>
<li class="L9451" rel="L9451">engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach</li>
<li class="L9452" rel="L9452">of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and</li>
<li class="L9453" rel="L9453">thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.</li>
<li class="L9454" rel="L9454"></li>
<li class="L9455" rel="L9455">When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth</li>
<li class="L9456" rel="L9456">had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon</li>
<li class="L9457" rel="L9457">found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of</li>
<li class="L9458" rel="L9458">good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet</li>
<li class="L9459" rel="L9459">deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that</li>
<li class="L9460" rel="L9460">every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,</li>
<li class="L9461" rel="L9461">to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.</li>
<li class="L9462" rel="L9462"></li>
<li class="L9463" rel="L9463">Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes&#39;</li>
<li class="L9464" rel="L9464">conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with</li>
<li class="L9465" rel="L9465">tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous</li>
<li class="L9466" rel="L9466">conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;</li>
<li class="L9467" rel="L9467">blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the</li>
<li class="L9468" rel="L9468">errors of her daughter must principally be owing.</li>
<li class="L9469" rel="L9469"></li>
<li class="L9470" rel="L9470">“If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to Brighton,</li>
<li class="L9471" rel="L9471">with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia</li>
<li class="L9472" rel="L9472">had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out</li>
<li class="L9473" rel="L9473">of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their</li>
<li class="L9474" rel="L9474">side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been</li>
<li class="L9475" rel="L9475">well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the</li>
<li class="L9476" rel="L9476">charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child!</li>
<li class="L9477" rel="L9477">And now here&#39;s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham,</li>
<li class="L9478" rel="L9478">wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become</li>
<li class="L9479" rel="L9479">of us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his</li>
<li class="L9480" rel="L9480">grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we</li>
<li class="L9481" rel="L9481">shall do.”</li>
<li class="L9482" rel="L9482"></li>
<li class="L9483" rel="L9483">They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after</li>
<li class="L9484" rel="L9484">general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her</li>
<li class="L9485" rel="L9485">that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.</li>
<li class="L9486" rel="L9486">Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.</li>
<li class="L9487" rel="L9487"></li>
<li class="L9488" rel="L9488">“Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he; “though it is right to be</li>
<li class="L9489" rel="L9489">prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.</li>
<li class="L9490" rel="L9490">It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we</li>
<li class="L9491" rel="L9491">may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,</li>
<li class="L9492" rel="L9492">and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as</li>
<li class="L9493" rel="L9493">lost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make</li>
<li class="L9494" rel="L9494">him come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult</li>
<li class="L9495" rel="L9495">together as to what is to be done.”</li>
<li class="L9496" rel="L9496"></li>
<li class="L9497" rel="L9497">“Oh! my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what I</li>
<li class="L9498" rel="L9498">could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,</li>
<li class="L9499" rel="L9499">wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them</li>
<li class="L9500" rel="L9500">marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but</li>
<li class="L9501" rel="L9501">tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,</li>
<li class="L9502" rel="L9502">after they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.</li>
<li class="L9503" rel="L9503">Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my</li>
<li class="L9504" rel="L9504">wits--and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me--such</li>
<li class="L9505" rel="L9505">spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that</li>
<li class="L9506" rel="L9506">I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to</li>
<li class="L9507" rel="L9507">give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does</li>
<li class="L9508" rel="L9508">not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I</li>
<li class="L9509" rel="L9509">know you will contrive it all.”</li>
<li class="L9510" rel="L9510"></li>
<li class="L9511" rel="L9511">But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours</li>
<li class="L9512" rel="L9512">in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well</li>
<li class="L9513" rel="L9513">in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till</li>
<li class="L9514" rel="L9514">dinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on</li>
<li class="L9515" rel="L9515">the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.</li>
<li class="L9516" rel="L9516"></li>
<li class="L9517" rel="L9517">Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real</li>
<li class="L9518" rel="L9518">occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to</li>
<li class="L9519" rel="L9519">oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her</li>
<li class="L9520" rel="L9520">tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it</li>
<li class="L9521" rel="L9521">better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could</li>
<li class="L9522" rel="L9522">most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the</li>
<li class="L9523" rel="L9523">subject.</li>
<li class="L9524" rel="L9524"></li>
<li class="L9525" rel="L9525">In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been</li>
<li class="L9526" rel="L9526">too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance</li>
<li class="L9527" rel="L9527">before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The</li>
<li class="L9528" rel="L9528">faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible</li>
<li class="L9529" rel="L9529">in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger</li>
<li class="L9530" rel="L9530">which she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of</li>
<li class="L9531" rel="L9531">fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was</li>
<li class="L9532" rel="L9532">mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance</li>
<li class="L9533" rel="L9533">of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:</li>
<li class="L9534" rel="L9534"></li>
<li class="L9535" rel="L9535">“This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.</li>
<li class="L9536" rel="L9536">But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of</li>
<li class="L9537" rel="L9537">each other the balm of sisterly consolation.”</li>
<li class="L9538" rel="L9538"></li>
<li class="L9539" rel="L9539">Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,</li>
<li class="L9540" rel="L9540">“Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful</li>
<li class="L9541" rel="L9541">lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one</li>
<li class="L9542" rel="L9542">false step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less</li>
<li class="L9543" rel="L9543">brittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in</li>
<li class="L9544" rel="L9544">her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.”</li>
<li class="L9545" rel="L9545"></li>
<li class="L9546" rel="L9546">Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed</li>
<li class="L9547" rel="L9547">to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such</li>
<li class="L9548" rel="L9548">kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.</li>
<li class="L9549" rel="L9549"></li>
<li class="L9550" rel="L9550">In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for</li>
<li class="L9551" rel="L9551">half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of</li>
<li class="L9552" rel="L9552">the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to</li>
<li class="L9553" rel="L9553">satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel</li>
<li class="L9554" rel="L9554">of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss</li>
<li class="L9555" rel="L9555">Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued</li>
<li class="L9556" rel="L9556">the subject, by saying, “But tell me all and everything about it which</li>
<li class="L9557" rel="L9557">I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel</li>
<li class="L9558" rel="L9558">Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement</li>
<li class="L9559" rel="L9559">took place? They must have seen them together for ever.”</li>
<li class="L9560" rel="L9560"></li>
<li class="L9561" rel="L9561">“Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,</li>
<li class="L9562" rel="L9562">especially on Lydia&#39;s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so</li>
<li class="L9563" rel="L9563">grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He</li>
<li class="L9564" rel="L9564">_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had</li>
<li class="L9565" rel="L9565">any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension</li>
<li class="L9566" rel="L9566">first got abroad, it hastened his journey.”</li>
<li class="L9567" rel="L9567"></li>
<li class="L9568" rel="L9568">“And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of</li>
<li class="L9569" rel="L9569">their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?”</li>
<li class="L9570" rel="L9570"></li>
<li class="L9571" rel="L9571">“Yes; but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of</li>
<li class="L9572" rel="L9572">their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not</li>
<li class="L9573" rel="L9573">repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am</li>
<li class="L9574" rel="L9574">inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.”</li>
<li class="L9575" rel="L9575"></li>
<li class="L9576" rel="L9576">“And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a</li>
<li class="L9577" rel="L9577">doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?”</li>
<li class="L9578" rel="L9578"></li>
<li class="L9579" rel="L9579">“How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt</li>
<li class="L9580" rel="L9580">a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister&#39;s happiness with him</li>
<li class="L9581" rel="L9581">in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite</li>
<li class="L9582" rel="L9582">right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how</li>
<li class="L9583" rel="L9583">imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural</li>
<li class="L9584" rel="L9584">triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia&#39;s last letter</li>
<li class="L9585" rel="L9585">she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their</li>
<li class="L9586" rel="L9586">being in love with each other, many weeks.”</li>
<li class="L9587" rel="L9587"></li>
<li class="L9588" rel="L9588">“But not before they went to Brighton?”</li>
<li class="L9589" rel="L9589"></li>
<li class="L9590" rel="L9590">“No, I believe not.”</li>
<li class="L9591" rel="L9591"></li>
<li class="L9592" rel="L9592">“And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does</li>
<li class="L9593" rel="L9593">he know his real character?”</li>
<li class="L9594" rel="L9594"></li>
<li class="L9595" rel="L9595">“I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly</li>
<li class="L9596" rel="L9596">did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad</li>
<li class="L9597" rel="L9597">affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt;</li>
<li class="L9598" rel="L9598">but I hope this may be false.”</li>
<li class="L9599" rel="L9599"></li>
<li class="L9600" rel="L9600">“Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,</li>
<li class="L9601" rel="L9601">this could not have happened!”</li>
<li class="L9602" rel="L9602"></li>
<li class="L9603" rel="L9603">“Perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister. “But to expose</li>
<li class="L9604" rel="L9604">the former faults of any person without knowing what their present</li>
<li class="L9605" rel="L9605">feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions.”</li>
<li class="L9606" rel="L9606"></li>
<li class="L9607" rel="L9607">“Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia&#39;s note to his</li>
<li class="L9608" rel="L9608">wife?”</li>
<li class="L9609" rel="L9609"></li>
<li class="L9610" rel="L9610">“He brought it with him for us to see.”</li>
<li class="L9611" rel="L9611"></li>
<li class="L9612" rel="L9612">Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These</li>
<li class="L9613" rel="L9613">were the contents:</li>
<li class="L9614" rel="L9614"></li>
<li class="L9615" rel="L9615">“MY DEAR HARRIET,</li>
<li class="L9616" rel="L9616"></li>
<li class="L9617" rel="L9617">“You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help</li>
<li class="L9618" rel="L9618">laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am</li>
<li class="L9619" rel="L9619">missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who,</li>
<li class="L9620" rel="L9620">I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I</li>
<li class="L9621" rel="L9621">love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so think</li>
<li class="L9622" rel="L9622">it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of my</li>
<li class="L9623" rel="L9623">going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater,</li>
<li class="L9624" rel="L9624">when I write to them and sign my name &#39;Lydia Wickham.&#39; What a good joke</li>
<li class="L9625" rel="L9625">it will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to</li>
<li class="L9626" rel="L9626">Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night.</li>
<li class="L9627" rel="L9627">Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will</li>
<li class="L9628" rel="L9628">dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall</li>
<li class="L9629" rel="L9629">send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell</li>
<li class="L9630" rel="L9630">Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are</li>
<li class="L9631" rel="L9631">packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will</li>
<li class="L9632" rel="L9632">drink to our good journey.</li>
<li class="L9633" rel="L9633"></li>
<li class="L9634" rel="L9634">“Your affectionate friend,</li>
<li class="L9635" rel="L9635"></li>
<li class="L9636" rel="L9636">“LYDIA BENNET.”</li>
<li class="L9637" rel="L9637"></li>
<li class="L9638" rel="L9638">“Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she had</li>
<li class="L9639" rel="L9639">finished it. “What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment!</li>
<li class="L9640" rel="L9640">But at least it shows that _she_ was serious on the subject of their</li>
<li class="L9641" rel="L9641">journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her</li>
<li class="L9642" rel="L9642">side a _scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!”</li>
<li class="L9643" rel="L9643"></li>
<li class="L9644" rel="L9644">“I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten</li>
<li class="L9645" rel="L9645">minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in</li>
<li class="L9646" rel="L9646">such confusion!”</li>
<li class="L9647" rel="L9647"></li>
<li class="L9648" rel="L9648">“Oh! Jane,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it who</li>
<li class="L9649" rel="L9649">did not know the whole story before the end of the day?”</li>
<li class="L9650" rel="L9650"></li>
<li class="L9651" rel="L9651">“I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is</li>
<li class="L9652" rel="L9652">very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to</li>
<li class="L9653" rel="L9653">give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so</li>
<li class="L9654" rel="L9654">much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen</li>
<li class="L9655" rel="L9655">almost took from me my faculties.”</li>
<li class="L9656" rel="L9656"></li>
<li class="L9657" rel="L9657">“Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look</li>
<li class="L9658" rel="L9658">well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety</li>
<li class="L9659" rel="L9659">upon yourself alone.”</li>
<li class="L9660" rel="L9660"></li>
<li class="L9661" rel="L9661">“Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every</li>
<li class="L9662" rel="L9662">fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them.</li>
<li class="L9663" rel="L9663">Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours</li>
<li class="L9664" rel="L9664">of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn</li>
<li class="L9665" rel="L9665">on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till</li>
<li class="L9666" rel="L9666">Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And</li>
<li class="L9667" rel="L9667">Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to</li>
<li class="L9668" rel="L9668">condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters&#39;, if</li>
<li class="L9669" rel="L9669">they should be of use to us.”</li>
<li class="L9670" rel="L9670"></li>
<li class="L9671" rel="L9671">“She had better have stayed at home,” cried Elizabeth; “perhaps she</li>
<li class="L9672" rel="L9672">_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see</li>
<li class="L9673" rel="L9673">too little of one&#39;s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence</li>
<li class="L9674" rel="L9674">insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.”</li>
<li class="L9675" rel="L9675"></li>
<li class="L9676" rel="L9676">She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had</li>
<li class="L9677" rel="L9677">intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.</li>
<li class="L9678" rel="L9678"></li>
<li class="L9679" rel="L9679">“He meant I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place where</li>
<li class="L9680" rel="L9680">they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could</li>
<li class="L9681" rel="L9681">be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the</li>
<li class="L9682" rel="L9682">number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come</li>
<li class="L9683" rel="L9683">with a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a</li>
<li class="L9684" rel="L9684">gentleman and lady&#39;s removing from one carriage into another might</li>
<li class="L9685" rel="L9685">be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow</li>
<li class="L9686" rel="L9686">discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he</li>
<li class="L9687" rel="L9687">determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible</li>
<li class="L9688" rel="L9688">to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any</li>
<li class="L9689" rel="L9689">other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,</li>
<li class="L9690" rel="L9690">and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding</li>
<li class="L9691" rel="L9691">out even so much as this.”</li>
<li class="L9692" rel="L9692"></li>
<li class="L9693" rel="L9693"></li>
<li class="L9694" rel="L9694"></li>
<li class="L9695" rel="L9695">Chapter 48</li>
<li class="L9696" rel="L9696"></li>
<li class="L9697" rel="L9697"></li>
<li class="L9698" rel="L9698">The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next</li>
<li class="L9699" rel="L9699">morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.</li>
<li class="L9700" rel="L9700">His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and</li>
<li class="L9701" rel="L9701">dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.</li>
<li class="L9702" rel="L9702">They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to</li>
<li class="L9703" rel="L9703">send; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.</li>
<li class="L9704" rel="L9704">Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.</li>
<li class="L9705" rel="L9705"></li>
<li class="L9706" rel="L9706">When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant</li>
<li class="L9707" rel="L9707">information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,</li>
<li class="L9708" rel="L9708">to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could,</li>
<li class="L9709" rel="L9709">to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only</li>
<li class="L9710" rel="L9710">security for her husband&#39;s not being killed in a duel.</li>
<li class="L9711" rel="L9711"></li>
<li class="L9712" rel="L9712">Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few</li>
<li class="L9713" rel="L9713">days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable</li>
<li class="L9714" rel="L9714">to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a</li>
<li class="L9715" rel="L9715">great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also</li>
<li class="L9716" rel="L9716">visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of</li>
<li class="L9717" rel="L9717">cheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without</li>
<li class="L9718" rel="L9718">reporting some fresh instance of Wickham&#39;s extravagance or irregularity,</li>
<li class="L9719" rel="L9719">she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found</li>
<li class="L9720" rel="L9720">them.</li>
<li class="L9721" rel="L9721"></li>
<li class="L9722" rel="L9722">All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months</li>
<li class="L9723" rel="L9723">before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt</li>
<li class="L9724" rel="L9724">to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with</li>
<li class="L9725" rel="L9725">the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman&#39;s family.</li>
<li class="L9726" rel="L9726">Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;</li>
<li class="L9727" rel="L9727">and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the</li>
<li class="L9728" rel="L9728">appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above</li>
<li class="L9729" rel="L9729">half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of</li>
<li class="L9730" rel="L9730">her sister&#39;s ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less</li>
<li class="L9731" rel="L9731">of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come</li>
<li class="L9732" rel="L9732">when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely</li>
<li class="L9733" rel="L9733">despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of</li>
<li class="L9734" rel="L9734">them.</li>
<li class="L9735" rel="L9735"></li>
<li class="L9736" rel="L9736">Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a</li>
<li class="L9737" rel="L9737">letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately</li>
<li class="L9738" rel="L9738">found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street;</li>
<li class="L9739" rel="L9739">that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival,</li>
<li class="L9740" rel="L9740">but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now</li>
<li class="L9741" rel="L9741">determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet</li>
<li class="L9742" rel="L9742">thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first</li>
<li class="L9743" rel="L9743">coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself</li>
<li class="L9744" rel="L9744">did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was</li>
<li class="L9745" rel="L9745">eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr.</li>
<li class="L9746" rel="L9746">Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised</li>
<li class="L9747" rel="L9747">to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect:</li>
<li class="L9748" rel="L9748"></li>
<li class="L9749" rel="L9749">“I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if</li>
<li class="L9750" rel="L9750">possible, from some of the young man&#39;s intimates in the regiment,</li>
<li class="L9751" rel="L9751">whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to</li>
<li class="L9752" rel="L9752">know in what part of town he has now concealed himself. If there were</li>
<li class="L9753" rel="L9753">anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a</li>
<li class="L9754" rel="L9754">clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have</li>
<li class="L9755" rel="L9755">nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in</li>
<li class="L9756" rel="L9756">his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps,</li>
<li class="L9757" rel="L9757">Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any</li>
<li class="L9758" rel="L9758">other person.”</li>
<li class="L9759" rel="L9759"></li>
<li class="L9760" rel="L9760">Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her</li>
<li class="L9761" rel="L9761">authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information</li>
<li class="L9762" rel="L9762">of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. She had never</li>
<li class="L9763" rel="L9763">heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both</li>
<li class="L9764" rel="L9764">of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of</li>
<li class="L9765" rel="L9765">his companions in the ----shire might be able to give more information;</li>
<li class="L9766" rel="L9766">and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application</li>
<li class="L9767" rel="L9767">was a something to look forward to.</li>
<li class="L9768" rel="L9768"></li>
<li class="L9769" rel="L9769">Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious</li>
<li class="L9770" rel="L9770">part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters</li>
<li class="L9771" rel="L9771">was the grand object of every morning&#39;s impatience. Through letters,</li>
<li class="L9772" rel="L9772">whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every</li>
<li class="L9773" rel="L9773">succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.</li>
<li class="L9774" rel="L9774"></li>
<li class="L9775" rel="L9775">But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for</li>
<li class="L9776" rel="L9776">their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane</li>
<li class="L9777" rel="L9777">had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,</li>
<li class="L9778" rel="L9778">she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his</li>
<li class="L9779" rel="L9779">letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as</li>
<li class="L9780" rel="L9780">follows:</li>
<li class="L9781" rel="L9781"></li>
<li class="L9782" rel="L9782">“MY DEAR SIR,</li>
<li class="L9783" rel="L9783"></li>
<li class="L9784" rel="L9784">“I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation</li>
<li class="L9785" rel="L9785">in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now</li>
<li class="L9786" rel="L9786">suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from</li>
<li class="L9787" rel="L9787">Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself</li>
<li class="L9788" rel="L9788">sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in</li>
<li class="L9789" rel="L9789">your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because</li>
<li class="L9790" rel="L9790">proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be</li>
<li class="L9791" rel="L9791">wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune--or that</li>
<li class="L9792" rel="L9792">may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the</li>
<li class="L9793" rel="L9793">most afflicting to a parent&#39;s mind. The death of your daughter would</li>
<li class="L9794" rel="L9794">have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to</li>
<li class="L9795" rel="L9795">be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte</li>
<li class="L9796" rel="L9796">informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has</li>
<li class="L9797" rel="L9797">proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time,</li>
<li class="L9798" rel="L9798">for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think</li>
<li class="L9799" rel="L9799">that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be</li>
<li class="L9800" rel="L9800">guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be,</li>
<li class="L9801" rel="L9801">you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined</li>
<li class="L9802" rel="L9802">by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to</li>
<li class="L9803" rel="L9803">whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that</li>
<li class="L9804" rel="L9804">this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of</li>
<li class="L9805" rel="L9805">all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says,</li>
<li class="L9806" rel="L9806">will connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads</li>
<li class="L9807" rel="L9807">me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event</li>
<li class="L9808" rel="L9808">of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved</li>
<li class="L9809" rel="L9809">in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to</li>
<li class="L9810" rel="L9810">console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child</li>
<li class="L9811" rel="L9811">from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her</li>
<li class="L9812" rel="L9812">own heinous offense.</li>
<li class="L9813" rel="L9813"></li>
<li class="L9814" rel="L9814">“I am, dear sir, etc., etc.”</li>
<li class="L9815" rel="L9815"></li>
<li class="L9816" rel="L9816">Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from</li>
<li class="L9817" rel="L9817">Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.</li>
<li class="L9818" rel="L9818">It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he</li>
<li class="L9819" rel="L9819">kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one</li>
<li class="L9820" rel="L9820">living. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he</li>
<li class="L9821" rel="L9821">had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of</li>
<li class="L9822" rel="L9822">particular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore,</li>
<li class="L9823" rel="L9823">who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the</li>
<li class="L9824" rel="L9824">wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for</li>
<li class="L9825" rel="L9825">secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia&#39;s relations, for</li>
<li class="L9826" rel="L9826">it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a</li>
<li class="L9827" rel="L9827">very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a</li>
<li class="L9828" rel="L9828">thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.</li>
<li class="L9829" rel="L9829">He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more</li>
<li class="L9830" rel="L9830">formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars</li>
<li class="L9831" rel="L9831">from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. “A gamester!”</li>
<li class="L9832" rel="L9832"> she cried. “This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.”</li>
<li class="L9833" rel="L9833"></li>
<li class="L9834" rel="L9834">Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their</li>
<li class="L9835" rel="L9835">father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered</li>
<li class="L9836" rel="L9836">spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded</li>
<li class="L9837" rel="L9837">to his brother-in-law&#39;s entreaty that he would return to his family, and</li>
<li class="L9838" rel="L9838">leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable</li>
<li class="L9839" rel="L9839">for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did</li>
<li class="L9840" rel="L9840">not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering</li>
<li class="L9841" rel="L9841">what her anxiety for his life had been before.</li>
<li class="L9842" rel="L9842"></li>
<li class="L9843" rel="L9843">“What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?” she cried. “Sure he</li>
<li class="L9844" rel="L9844">will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,</li>
<li class="L9845" rel="L9845">and make him marry her, if he comes away?”</li>
<li class="L9846" rel="L9846"></li>
<li class="L9847" rel="L9847">As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she</li>
<li class="L9848" rel="L9848">and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet</li>
<li class="L9849" rel="L9849">came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their</li>
<li class="L9850" rel="L9850">journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.</li>
<li class="L9851" rel="L9851"></li>
<li class="L9852" rel="L9852">Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her</li>
<li class="L9853" rel="L9853">Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. His</li>
<li class="L9854" rel="L9854">name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and</li>
<li class="L9855" rel="L9855">the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their</li>
<li class="L9856" rel="L9856">being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had</li>
<li class="L9857" rel="L9857">received none since her return that could come from Pemberley.</li>
<li class="L9858" rel="L9858"></li>
<li class="L9859" rel="L9859">The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for</li>
<li class="L9860" rel="L9860">the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be</li>
<li class="L9861" rel="L9861">fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time</li>
<li class="L9862" rel="L9862">tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware</li>
<li class="L9863" rel="L9863">that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of</li>
<li class="L9864" rel="L9864">Lydia&#39;s infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,</li>
<li class="L9865" rel="L9865">one sleepless night out of two.</li>
<li class="L9866" rel="L9866"></li>
<li class="L9867" rel="L9867">When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual</li>
<li class="L9868" rel="L9868">philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the</li>
<li class="L9869" rel="L9869">habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him</li>
<li class="L9870" rel="L9870">away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of</li>
<li class="L9871" rel="L9871">it.</li>
<li class="L9872" rel="L9872"></li>
<li class="L9873" rel="L9873">It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that</li>
<li class="L9874" rel="L9874">Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly</li>
<li class="L9875" rel="L9875">expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, “Say</li>
<li class="L9876" rel="L9876">nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,</li>
<li class="L9877" rel="L9877">and I ought to feel it.”</li>
<li class="L9878" rel="L9878"></li>
<li class="L9879" rel="L9879">“You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.</li>
<li class="L9880" rel="L9880"></li>
<li class="L9881" rel="L9881">“You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone</li>
<li class="L9882" rel="L9882">to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have</li>
<li class="L9883" rel="L9883">been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.</li>
<li class="L9884" rel="L9884">It will pass away soon enough.”</li>
<li class="L9885" rel="L9885"></li>
<li class="L9886" rel="L9886">“Do you suppose them to be in London?”</li>
<li class="L9887" rel="L9887"></li>
<li class="L9888" rel="L9888">“Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”</li>
<li class="L9889" rel="L9889"></li>
<li class="L9890" rel="L9890">“And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.</li>
<li class="L9891" rel="L9891"></li>
<li class="L9892" rel="L9892">“She is happy then,” said her father drily; “and her residence there</li>
<li class="L9893" rel="L9893">will probably be of some duration.”</li>
<li class="L9894" rel="L9894"></li>
<li class="L9895" rel="L9895">Then after a short silence he continued:</li>
<li class="L9896" rel="L9896"></li>
<li class="L9897" rel="L9897">“Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me</li>
<li class="L9898" rel="L9898">last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.”</li>
<li class="L9899" rel="L9899"></li>
<li class="L9900" rel="L9900">They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother&#39;s</li>
<li class="L9901" rel="L9901">tea.</li>
<li class="L9902" rel="L9902"></li>
<li class="L9903" rel="L9903">“This is a parade,” he cried, “which does one good; it gives such an</li>
<li class="L9904" rel="L9904">elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my</li>
<li class="L9905" rel="L9905">library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as</li>
<li class="L9906" rel="L9906">I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.”</li>
<li class="L9907" rel="L9907"></li>
<li class="L9908" rel="L9908">“I am not going to run away, papa,” said Kitty fretfully. “If I should</li>
<li class="L9909" rel="L9909">ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.”</li>
<li class="L9910" rel="L9910"></li>
<li class="L9911" rel="L9911">“_You_ go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne</li>
<li class="L9912" rel="L9912">for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and</li>
<li class="L9913" rel="L9913">you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into</li>
<li class="L9914" rel="L9914">my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be</li>
<li class="L9915" rel="L9915">absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.</li>
<li class="L9916" rel="L9916">And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have</li>
<li class="L9917" rel="L9917">spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.”</li>
<li class="L9918" rel="L9918"></li>
<li class="L9919" rel="L9919">Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.</li>
<li class="L9920" rel="L9920"></li>
<li class="L9921" rel="L9921">“Well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good</li>
<li class="L9922" rel="L9922">girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of</li>
<li class="L9923" rel="L9923">them.”</li>

<li class="L9929" rel="L9929"></li>
<li class="L9930" rel="L9930">Two days after Mr. Bennet&#39;s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking</li>
<li class="L9931" rel="L9931">together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper</li>
<li class="L9932" rel="L9932">coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their</li>
<li class="L9933" rel="L9933">mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,</li>
<li class="L9934" rel="L9934">when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, “I beg your pardon,</li>
<li class="L9935" rel="L9935">madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some</li>
<li class="L9936" rel="L9936">good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.”</li>
<li class="L9937" rel="L9937"></li>
<li class="L9938" rel="L9938">“What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.”</li>
<li class="L9939" rel="L9939"></li>
<li class="L9940" rel="L9940">“Dear madam,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don&#39;t you know</li>
<li class="L9941" rel="L9941">there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here</li>
<li class="L9942" rel="L9942">this half-hour, and master has had a letter.”</li>
<li class="L9943" rel="L9943"></li>
<li class="L9944" rel="L9944">Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They</li>
<li class="L9945" rel="L9945">ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the</li>
<li class="L9946" rel="L9946">library; their father was in neither; and they were on the point of</li>
<li class="L9947" rel="L9947">seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the</li>
<li class="L9948" rel="L9948">butler, who said:</li>
<li class="L9949" rel="L9949"></li>
<li class="L9950" rel="L9950">“If you are looking for my master, ma&#39;am, he is walking towards the</li>
<li class="L9951" rel="L9951">little copse.”</li>
<li class="L9952" rel="L9952"></li>
<li class="L9953" rel="L9953">Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once</li>
<li class="L9954" rel="L9954">more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately</li>
<li class="L9955" rel="L9955">pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.</li>
<li class="L9956" rel="L9956"></li>
<li class="L9957" rel="L9957">Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as</li>
<li class="L9958" rel="L9958">Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,</li>
<li class="L9959" rel="L9959">came up with him, and eagerly cried out:</li>
<li class="L9960" rel="L9960"></li>
<li class="L9961" rel="L9961">“Oh, papa, what news--what news? Have you heard from my uncle?”</li>
<li class="L9962" rel="L9962"></li>
<li class="L9963" rel="L9963">“Yes I have had a letter from him by express.”</li>
<li class="L9964" rel="L9964"></li>
<li class="L9965" rel="L9965">“Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?”</li>
<li class="L9966" rel="L9966"></li>
<li class="L9967" rel="L9967">“What is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the letter from</li>
<li class="L9968" rel="L9968">his pocket. “But perhaps you would like to read it.”</li>
<li class="L9969" rel="L9969"></li>
<li class="L9970" rel="L9970">Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.</li>
<li class="L9971" rel="L9971"></li>
<li class="L9972" rel="L9972">“Read it aloud,” said their father, “for I hardly know myself what it is</li>
<li class="L9973" rel="L9973">about.”</li>
<li class="L9974" rel="L9974"></li>
<li class="L9975" rel="L9975">“Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.</li>
<li class="L9976" rel="L9976"></li>
<li class="L9977" rel="L9977">“MY DEAR BROTHER,</li>
<li class="L9978" rel="L9978"></li>
<li class="L9979" rel="L9979">“At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as,</li>
<li class="L9980" rel="L9980">upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you</li>
<li class="L9981" rel="L9981">left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of</li>
<li class="L9982" rel="L9982">London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough</li>
<li class="L9983" rel="L9983">to know they are discovered. I have seen them both--”</li>
<li class="L9984" rel="L9984"></li>
<li class="L9985" rel="L9985">“Then it is as I always hoped,” cried Jane; “they are married!”</li>
<li class="L9986" rel="L9986"></li>
<li class="L9987" rel="L9987">Elizabeth read on:</li>
<li class="L9988" rel="L9988"></li>
<li class="L9989" rel="L9989">“I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there</li>

<li class="L9991" rel="L9991">engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will</li>
<li class="L9992" rel="L9992">not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure</li>
<li class="L9993" rel="L9993">to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand</li>
<li class="L9994" rel="L9994">pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and</li>
<li class="L9995" rel="L9995">my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her,</li>
<li class="L9996" rel="L9996">during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions</li>
<li class="L9997" rel="L9997">which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with,</li>
<li class="L9998" rel="L9998">as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by</li>
<li class="L9999" rel="L9999">express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You</li>
<li class="L10000" rel="L10000">will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham&#39;s</li>
<li class="L10001" rel="L10001">circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.</li>
<li class="L10002" rel="L10002">The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there</li>
<li class="L10003" rel="L10003">will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to</li>
<li class="L10004" rel="L10004">settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude</li>
<li class="L10005" rel="L10005">will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout</li>
<li class="L10006" rel="L10006">the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to</li>
<li class="L10007" rel="L10007">Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the</li>
<li class="L10008" rel="L10008">smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at</li>

<li class="L10010" rel="L10010">fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it</li>
<li class="L10011" rel="L10011">best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope</li>
<li class="L10012" rel="L10012">you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as</li>

<li class="L10016" rel="L10016"></li>
<li class="L10017" rel="L10017">“Is it possible?” cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. “Can it be</li>
<li class="L10018" rel="L10018">possible that he will marry her?”</li>
<li class="L10019" rel="L10019"></li>
<li class="L10020" rel="L10020">“Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,” said her</li>
<li class="L10021" rel="L10021">sister. “My dear father, I congratulate you.”</li>
<li class="L10022" rel="L10022"></li>
<li class="L10023" rel="L10023">“And have you answered the letter?” cried Elizabeth.</li>
<li class="L10024" rel="L10024"></li>
<li class="L10025" rel="L10025">“No; but it must be done soon.”</li>
<li class="L10026" rel="L10026"></li>
<li class="L10027" rel="L10027">Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he</li>
<li class="L10028" rel="L10028">wrote.</li>
<li class="L10029" rel="L10029"></li>
<li class="L10030" rel="L10030">“Oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write immediately.</li>
<li class="L10031" rel="L10031">Consider how important every moment is in such a case.”</li>
<li class="L10032" rel="L10032"></li>
<li class="L10033" rel="L10033">“Let me write for you,” said Jane, “if you dislike the trouble</li>
<li class="L10034" rel="L10034">yourself.”</li>
<li class="L10035" rel="L10035"></li>
<li class="L10036" rel="L10036">“I dislike it very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.”</li>
<li class="L10037" rel="L10037"></li>
<li class="L10038" rel="L10038">And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.</li>
<li class="L10039" rel="L10039"></li>
<li class="L10040" rel="L10040">“And may I ask--” said Elizabeth; “but the terms, I suppose, must be</li>
<li class="L10041" rel="L10041">complied with.”</li>
<li class="L10042" rel="L10042"></li>
<li class="L10043" rel="L10043">“Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.”</li>
<li class="L10044" rel="L10044"></li>
<li class="L10045" rel="L10045">“And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!”</li>
<li class="L10046" rel="L10046"></li>
<li class="L10047" rel="L10047">“Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there</li>
<li class="L10048" rel="L10048">are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money</li>
<li class="L10049" rel="L10049">your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever</li>
<li class="L10050" rel="L10050">to pay him.”</li>
<li class="L10051" rel="L10051"></li>
<li class="L10052" rel="L10052">“Money! My uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, sir?”</li>
<li class="L10053" rel="L10053"></li>
<li class="L10054" rel="L10054">“I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a</li>
<li class="L10055" rel="L10055">temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am</li>
<li class="L10056" rel="L10056">gone.”</li>
<li class="L10057" rel="L10057"></li>
<li class="L10058" rel="L10058">“That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred to me</li>
<li class="L10059" rel="L10059">before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh!</li>
<li class="L10060" rel="L10060">it must be my uncle&#39;s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has</li>
<li class="L10061" rel="L10061">distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.”</li>
<li class="L10062" rel="L10062"></li>
<li class="L10063" rel="L10063">“No,” said her father; “Wickham&#39;s a fool if he takes her with a farthing</li>
<li class="L10064" rel="L10064">less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him,</li>
<li class="L10065" rel="L10065">in the very beginning of our relationship.”</li>
<li class="L10066" rel="L10066"></li>
<li class="L10067" rel="L10067">“Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be</li>
<li class="L10068" rel="L10068">repaid?”</li>
<li class="L10069" rel="L10069"></li>
<li class="L10070" rel="L10070">Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued</li>
<li class="L10071" rel="L10071">silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the</li>
<li class="L10072" rel="L10072">library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.</li>
<li class="L10073" rel="L10073"></li>
<li class="L10074" rel="L10074">“And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth, as soon as they</li>
<li class="L10075" rel="L10075">were by themselves. “How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be</li>
<li class="L10076" rel="L10076">thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,</li>
<li class="L10077" rel="L10077">and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!”</li>
<li class="L10078" rel="L10078"></li>
<li class="L10079" rel="L10079">“I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that he certainly would</li>
<li class="L10080" rel="L10080">not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind</li>
<li class="L10081" rel="L10081">uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten</li>
<li class="L10082" rel="L10082">thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children</li>
<li class="L10083" rel="L10083">of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand</li>
<li class="L10084" rel="L10084">pounds?”</li>
<li class="L10085" rel="L10085"></li>
<li class="L10086" rel="L10086">“If he were ever able to learn what Wickham&#39;s debts have been,” said</li>
<li class="L10087" rel="L10087">Elizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall</li>
<li class="L10088" rel="L10088">exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has</li>
<li class="L10089" rel="L10089">not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never</li>
<li class="L10090" rel="L10090">be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal</li>
<li class="L10091" rel="L10091">protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as</li>
<li class="L10092" rel="L10092">years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is</li>
<li class="L10093" rel="L10093">actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,</li>
<li class="L10094" rel="L10094">she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she</li>
<li class="L10095" rel="L10095">first sees my aunt!”</li>
<li class="L10096" rel="L10096"></li>
<li class="L10097" rel="L10097">“We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,” said</li>
<li class="L10098" rel="L10098">Jane: “I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to</li>
<li class="L10099" rel="L10099">marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of</li>
<li class="L10100" rel="L10100">thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself</li>
<li class="L10101" rel="L10101">they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in</li>
<li class="L10102" rel="L10102">time make their past imprudence forgotten.”</li>
<li class="L10103" rel="L10103"></li>
<li class="L10104" rel="L10104">“Their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither you, nor</li>
<li class="L10105" rel="L10105">I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.”</li>
<li class="L10106" rel="L10106"></li>
<li class="L10107" rel="L10107">It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood</li>
<li class="L10108" rel="L10108">perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,</li>
<li class="L10109" rel="L10109">therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make</li>
<li class="L10110" rel="L10110">it known to her. He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly</li>
<li class="L10111" rel="L10111">replied:</li>
<li class="L10112" rel="L10112"></li>
<li class="L10113" rel="L10113">“Just as you please.”</li>
<li class="L10114" rel="L10114"></li>
<li class="L10115" rel="L10115">“May we take my uncle&#39;s letter to read to her?”</li>
<li class="L10116" rel="L10116"></li>
<li class="L10117" rel="L10117">“Take whatever you like, and get away.”</li>
<li class="L10118" rel="L10118"></li>
<li class="L10119" rel="L10119">Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairs</li>
<li class="L10120" rel="L10120">together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication</li>
<li class="L10121" rel="L10121">would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,</li>
<li class="L10122" rel="L10122">the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As</li>
<li class="L10123" rel="L10123">soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner&#39;s hope of Lydia&#39;s being soon</li>
<li class="L10124" rel="L10124">married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its</li>
<li class="L10125" rel="L10125">exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she</li>
<li class="L10126" rel="L10126">had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter</li>
<li class="L10127" rel="L10127">would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her</li>
<li class="L10128" rel="L10128">felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.</li>
<li class="L10129" rel="L10129"></li>
<li class="L10130" rel="L10130">“My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried. “This is delightful indeed! She will</li>
<li class="L10131" rel="L10131">be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen!</li>
<li class="L10132" rel="L10132">My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage</li>
<li class="L10133" rel="L10133">everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the</li>
<li class="L10134" rel="L10134">clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about</li>
<li class="L10135" rel="L10135">them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him</li>
<li class="L10136" rel="L10136">how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,</li>
<li class="L10137" rel="L10137">Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear</li>
<li class="L10138" rel="L10138">Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!”</li>
<li class="L10139" rel="L10139"></li>
<li class="L10140" rel="L10140">Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of</li>
<li class="L10141" rel="L10141">these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.</li>
<li class="L10142" rel="L10142">Gardiner&#39;s behaviour laid them all under.</li>
<li class="L10143" rel="L10143"></li>
<li class="L10144" rel="L10144">“For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a great</li>
<li class="L10145" rel="L10145">measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to</li>
<li class="L10146" rel="L10146">assist Mr. Wickham with money.”</li>
<li class="L10147" rel="L10147"></li>
<li class="L10148" rel="L10148">“Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but</li>
<li class="L10149" rel="L10149">her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children</li>
<li class="L10150" rel="L10150">must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have</li>
<li class="L10151" rel="L10151">ever had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy!</li>
<li class="L10152" rel="L10152">In a short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well</li>
<li class="L10153" rel="L10153">it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in</li>
<li class="L10154" rel="L10154">such a flutter, that I am sure I can&#39;t write; so I will dictate, and</li>
<li class="L10155" rel="L10155">you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money</li>
<li class="L10156" rel="L10156">afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”</li>
<li class="L10157" rel="L10157"></li>
<li class="L10158" rel="L10158">She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and</li>
<li class="L10159" rel="L10159">cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had</li>
<li class="L10160" rel="L10160">not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her</li>
<li class="L10161" rel="L10161">father was at leisure to be consulted. One day&#39;s delay, she observed,</li>
<li class="L10162" rel="L10162">would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite</li>
<li class="L10163" rel="L10163">so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.</li>
<li class="L10164" rel="L10164"></li>
<li class="L10165" rel="L10165">“I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and tell the</li>
<li class="L10166" rel="L10166">good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call</li>
<li class="L10167" rel="L10167">on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage.</li>
<li class="L10168" rel="L10168">An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do</li>
<li class="L10169" rel="L10169">anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you</li>
<li class="L10170" rel="L10170">heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall</li>
<li class="L10171" rel="L10171">all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.”</li>
<li class="L10172" rel="L10172"></li>
<li class="L10173" rel="L10173">Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her</li>
<li class="L10174" rel="L10174">congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took</li>
<li class="L10175" rel="L10175">refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.</li>
<li class="L10176" rel="L10176"></li>
<li class="L10177" rel="L10177">Poor Lydia&#39;s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was</li>
<li class="L10178" rel="L10178">no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in</li>
<li class="L10179" rel="L10179">looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could</li>
<li class="L10180" rel="L10180">be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had</li>
<li class="L10181" rel="L10181">feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had</li>
<li class="L10182" rel="L10182">gained.</li>
<li class="L10183" rel="L10183"></li>
<li class="L10184" rel="L10184"></li>
<li class="L10185" rel="L10185"></li>
<li class="L10186" rel="L10186">Chapter 50</li>
<li class="L10187" rel="L10187"></li>
<li class="L10188" rel="L10188"></li>
<li class="L10189" rel="L10189">Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that,</li>
<li class="L10190" rel="L10190">instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for</li>
<li class="L10191" rel="L10191">the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived</li>
<li class="L10192" rel="L10192">him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that</li>
<li class="L10193" rel="L10193">respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever</li>
<li class="L10194" rel="L10194">of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of</li>
<li class="L10195" rel="L10195">prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be</li>
<li class="L10196" rel="L10196">her husband might then have rested in its proper place.</li>
<li class="L10197" rel="L10197"></li>
<li class="L10198" rel="L10198">He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone</li>
<li class="L10199" rel="L10199">should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he</li>
<li class="L10200" rel="L10200">was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,</li>
<li class="L10201" rel="L10201">and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.</li>
<li class="L10202" rel="L10202"></li>
<li class="L10203" rel="L10203">When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly</li>
<li class="L10204" rel="L10204">useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join</li>
<li class="L10205" rel="L10205">in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow</li>
<li class="L10206" rel="L10206">and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters</li>
<li class="L10207" rel="L10207">successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.</li>
<li class="L10208" rel="L10208">Bennet, for many years after Lydia&#39;s birth, had been certain that he</li>
<li class="L10209" rel="L10209">would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then</li>
<li class="L10210" rel="L10210">too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her</li>
<li class="L10211" rel="L10211">husband&#39;s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their</li>
<li class="L10212" rel="L10212">income.</li>
<li class="L10213" rel="L10213"></li>
<li class="L10214" rel="L10214">Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and</li>
<li class="L10215" rel="L10215">the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the</li>
<li class="L10216" rel="L10216">latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with</li>
<li class="L10217" rel="L10217">regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet</li>
<li class="L10218" rel="L10218">could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In</li>
<li class="L10219" rel="L10219">terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother,</li>
<li class="L10220" rel="L10220">though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect</li>
<li class="L10221" rel="L10221">approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the</li>
<li class="L10222" rel="L10222">engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed</li>
<li class="L10223" rel="L10223">that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would</li>
<li class="L10224" rel="L10224">be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present</li>
<li class="L10225" rel="L10225">arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the</li>
<li class="L10226" rel="L10226">hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket</li>
<li class="L10227" rel="L10227">allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her</li>
<li class="L10228" rel="L10228">through her mother&#39;s hands, Lydia&#39;s expenses had been very little within</li>
<li class="L10229" rel="L10229">that sum.</li>
<li class="L10230" rel="L10230"></li>
<li class="L10231" rel="L10231">That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was</li>
<li class="L10232" rel="L10232">another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as</li>
<li class="L10233" rel="L10233">little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports</li>
<li class="L10234" rel="L10234">of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he</li>
<li class="L10235" rel="L10235">naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon</li>
<li class="L10236" rel="L10236">dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick</li>
<li class="L10237" rel="L10237">in its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he</li>
<li class="L10238" rel="L10238">was indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any</li>
<li class="L10239" rel="L10239">message to her.</li>
<li class="L10240" rel="L10240"></li>
<li class="L10241" rel="L10241">The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate</li>
<li class="L10242" rel="L10242">speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent</li>
<li class="L10243" rel="L10243">philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage</li>
<li class="L10244" rel="L10244">of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the</li>
<li class="L10245" rel="L10245">happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant</li>
<li class="L10246" rel="L10246">farmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the</li>
<li class="L10247" rel="L10247">good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from</li>
<li class="L10248" rel="L10248">all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit</li>
<li class="L10249" rel="L10249">in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery</li>
<li class="L10250" rel="L10250">was considered certain.</li>
<li class="L10251" rel="L10251"></li>
<li class="L10252" rel="L10252">It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this</li>
<li class="L10253" rel="L10253">happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in</li>
<li class="L10254" rel="L10254">spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her</li>
<li class="L10255" rel="L10255">triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object</li>
<li class="L10256" rel="L10256">of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of</li>
<li class="L10257" rel="L10257">accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those</li>
<li class="L10258" rel="L10258">attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and</li>
<li class="L10259" rel="L10259">servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a</li>
<li class="L10260" rel="L10260">proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering</li>
<li class="L10261" rel="L10261">what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and</li>
<li class="L10262" rel="L10262">importance.</li>
<li class="L10263" rel="L10263"></li>
<li class="L10264" rel="L10264">“Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings could quit it--or the</li>
<li class="L10265" rel="L10265">great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is</li>
<li class="L10266" rel="L10266">too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for</li>
<li class="L10267" rel="L10267">Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”</li>
<li class="L10268" rel="L10268"></li>
<li class="L10269" rel="L10269">Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the</li>
<li class="L10270" rel="L10270">servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: “Mrs.</li>
<li class="L10271" rel="L10271">Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and</li>
<li class="L10272" rel="L10272">daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this</li>
<li class="L10273" rel="L10273">neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the</li>
<li class="L10274" rel="L10274">impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.”</li>
<li class="L10275" rel="L10275"></li>
<li class="L10276" rel="L10276">A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It</li>
<li class="L10277" rel="L10277">soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,</li>
<li class="L10278" rel="L10278">that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his</li>
<li class="L10279" rel="L10279">daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of</li>
<li class="L10280" rel="L10280">affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend</li>
<li class="L10281" rel="L10281">it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable</li>
<li class="L10282" rel="L10282">resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her</li>
<li class="L10283" rel="L10283">marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe</li>
<li class="L10284" rel="L10284">possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new</li>
<li class="L10285" rel="L10285">clothes must reflect on her daughter&#39;s nuptials, than to any sense of</li>
<li class="L10286" rel="L10286">shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they</li>
<li class="L10287" rel="L10287">took place.</li>
<li class="L10288" rel="L10288"></li>
<li class="L10289" rel="L10289">Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of</li>
<li class="L10290" rel="L10290">the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for</li>
<li class="L10291" rel="L10291">her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the</li>
<li class="L10292" rel="L10292">proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its</li>
<li class="L10293" rel="L10293">unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the</li>
<li class="L10294" rel="L10294">spot.</li>
<li class="L10295" rel="L10295"></li>
<li class="L10296" rel="L10296">She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were</li>
<li class="L10297" rel="L10297">few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;</li>
<li class="L10298" rel="L10298">but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister&#39;s</li>
<li class="L10299" rel="L10299">frailty would have mortified her so much--not, however, from any fear</li>
<li class="L10300" rel="L10300">of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate,</li>
<li class="L10301" rel="L10301">there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia&#39;s marriage been</li>
<li class="L10302" rel="L10302">concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that</li>
<li class="L10303" rel="L10303">Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other</li>
<li class="L10304" rel="L10304">objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the</li>
<li class="L10305" rel="L10305">nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.</li>
<li class="L10306" rel="L10306"></li>
<li class="L10307" rel="L10307">From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The</li>
<li class="L10308" rel="L10308">wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his</li>
<li class="L10309" rel="L10309">feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a</li>
<li class="L10310" rel="L10310">blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she</li>
<li class="L10311" rel="L10311">hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no</li>
<li class="L10312" rel="L10312">longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there</li>
<li class="L10313" rel="L10313">seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that</li>
<li class="L10314" rel="L10314">she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they</li>
<li class="L10315" rel="L10315">should meet.</li>
<li class="L10316" rel="L10316"></li>
<li class="L10317" rel="L10317">What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the</li>
<li class="L10318" rel="L10318">proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now</li>
<li class="L10319" rel="L10319">have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she</li>
<li class="L10320" rel="L10320">doubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal,</li>
<li class="L10321" rel="L10321">there must be a triumph.</li>
<li class="L10322" rel="L10322"></li>
<li class="L10323" rel="L10323">She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in</li>
<li class="L10324" rel="L10324">disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and</li>
<li class="L10325" rel="L10325">temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It</li>
<li class="L10326" rel="L10326">was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease</li>
<li class="L10327" rel="L10327">and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;</li>
<li class="L10328" rel="L10328">and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she</li>
<li class="L10329" rel="L10329">must have received benefit of greater importance.</li>
<li class="L10330" rel="L10330"></li>
<li class="L10331" rel="L10331">But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what</li>
<li class="L10332" rel="L10332">connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and</li>
<li class="L10333" rel="L10333">precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their</li>
<li class="L10334" rel="L10334">family.</li>
<li class="L10335" rel="L10335"></li>
<li class="L10336" rel="L10336">How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,</li>
<li class="L10337" rel="L10337">she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could</li>
<li class="L10338" rel="L10338">belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions</li>
<li class="L10339" rel="L10339">were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.</li>
<li class="L10340" rel="L10340"></li>
<li class="L10341" rel="L10341">                          * * * * *</li>
<li class="L10342" rel="L10342"></li>
<li class="L10343" rel="L10343">Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet&#39;s</li>
<li class="L10344" rel="L10344">acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to</li>
<li class="L10345" rel="L10345">promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties</li>
<li class="L10346" rel="L10346">that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal</li>
<li class="L10347" rel="L10347">purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved</li>
<li class="L10348" rel="L10348">on quitting the militia.</li>
<li class="L10349" rel="L10349"></li>
<li class="L10350" rel="L10350">“It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon as</li>
<li class="L10351" rel="L10351">his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in</li>
<li class="L10352" rel="L10352">considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on</li>
<li class="L10353" rel="L10353">his account and my niece&#39;s. It is Mr. Wickham&#39;s intention to go into</li>
<li class="L10354" rel="L10354">the regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who</li>
<li class="L10355" rel="L10355">are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an</li>
<li class="L10356" rel="L10356">ensigncy in General ----&#39;s regiment, now quartered in the North. It</li>
<li class="L10357" rel="L10357">is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He</li>
<li class="L10358" rel="L10358">promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each</li>
<li class="L10359" rel="L10359">have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have</li>
<li class="L10360" rel="L10360">written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,</li>
<li class="L10361" rel="L10361">and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham</li>
<li class="L10362" rel="L10362">in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I</li>
<li class="L10363" rel="L10363">have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying</li>
<li class="L10364" rel="L10364">similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin</li>
<li class="L10365" rel="L10365">a list according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I</li>
<li class="L10366" rel="L10366">hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions,</li>
<li class="L10367" rel="L10367">and all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,</li>
<li class="L10368" rel="L10368">unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.</li>
<li class="L10369" rel="L10369">Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she</li>
<li class="L10370" rel="L10370">leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to</li>
<li class="L10371" rel="L10371">you and her mother.--Yours, etc.,</li>
<li class="L10372" rel="L10372"></li>
<li class="L10373" rel="L10373">“E. GARDINER.”</li>
<li class="L10374" rel="L10374"></li>
<li class="L10375" rel="L10375">Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham&#39;s removal</li>
<li class="L10376" rel="L10376">from the ----shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet</li>
<li class="L10377" rel="L10377">was not so well pleased with it. Lydia&#39;s being settled in the North,</li>
<li class="L10378" rel="L10378">just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company,</li>
<li class="L10379" rel="L10379">for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in</li>
<li class="L10380" rel="L10380">Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a</li>
<li class="L10381" rel="L10381">pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted</li>
<li class="L10382" rel="L10382">with everybody, and had so many favourites.</li>
<li class="L10383" rel="L10383"></li>
<li class="L10384" rel="L10384">“She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking</li>
<li class="L10385" rel="L10385">to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she</li>
<li class="L10386" rel="L10386">likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----&#39;s</li>
<li class="L10387" rel="L10387">regiment.”</li>
<li class="L10388" rel="L10388"></li>
<li class="L10389" rel="L10389">His daughter&#39;s request, for such it might be considered, of being</li>
<li class="L10390" rel="L10390">admitted into her family again before she set off for the North,</li>
<li class="L10391" rel="L10391">received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth,</li>
<li class="L10392" rel="L10392">who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister&#39;s feelings and</li>
<li class="L10393" rel="L10393">consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,</li>
<li class="L10394" rel="L10394">urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her</li>
<li class="L10395" rel="L10395">and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was</li>
<li class="L10396" rel="L10396">prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their</li>
<li class="L10397" rel="L10397">mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show</li>
<li class="L10398" rel="L10398">her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the</li>
<li class="L10399" rel="L10399">North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent</li>
<li class="L10400" rel="L10400">his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as</li>
<li class="L10401" rel="L10401">the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was</li>
<li class="L10402" rel="L10402">surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and</li>
<li class="L10403" rel="L10403">had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would</li>
<li class="L10404" rel="L10404">have been the last object of her wishes.</li>
<li class="L10405" rel="L10405"></li>
<li class="L10406" rel="L10406"></li>

<li class="L10409" rel="L10409"></li>
<li class="L10410" rel="L10410"></li>
<li class="L10411" rel="L10411">Their sister&#39;s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her</li>
<li class="L10412" rel="L10412">probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to</li>
<li class="L10413" rel="L10413">meet them at ----, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their</li>
<li class="L10414" rel="L10414">arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially,</li>
<li class="L10415" rel="L10415">who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she</li>
<li class="L10416" rel="L10416">been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister</li>
<li class="L10417" rel="L10417">must endure.</li>
<li class="L10418" rel="L10418"></li>
<li class="L10419" rel="L10419">They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive</li>
<li class="L10420" rel="L10420">them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to</li>
<li class="L10421" rel="L10421">the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,</li>
<li class="L10422" rel="L10422">anxious, uneasy.</li>
<li class="L10423" rel="L10423"></li>
<li class="L10424" rel="L10424">Lydia&#39;s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and</li>
<li class="L10425" rel="L10425">she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and</li>
<li class="L10426" rel="L10426">welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile,</li>
<li class="L10427" rel="L10427">to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an</li>
<li class="L10428" rel="L10428">alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.</li>
<li class="L10429" rel="L10429"></li>
<li class="L10430" rel="L10430">Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite</li>
<li class="L10431" rel="L10431">so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely</li>
<li class="L10432" rel="L10432">opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was</li>
<li class="L10433" rel="L10433">enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet</li>
<li class="L10434" rel="L10434">was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy,</li>
<li class="L10435" rel="L10435">and fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their</li>
<li class="L10436" rel="L10436">congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly</li>
<li class="L10437" rel="L10437">round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and</li>
<li class="L10438" rel="L10438">observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been</li>
<li class="L10439" rel="L10439">there.</li>
<li class="L10440" rel="L10440"></li>
<li class="L10441" rel="L10441">Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners</li>
<li class="L10442" rel="L10442">were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been</li>
<li class="L10443" rel="L10443">exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he</li>
<li class="L10444" rel="L10444">claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had</li>
<li class="L10445" rel="L10445">not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,</li>
<li class="L10446" rel="L10446">resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence</li>
<li class="L10447" rel="L10447">of an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the</li>
<li class="L10448" rel="L10448">two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.</li>
<li class="L10449" rel="L10449"></li>
<li class="L10450" rel="L10450">There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither</li>
<li class="L10451" rel="L10451">of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near</li>
<li class="L10452" rel="L10452">Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,</li>
<li class="L10453" rel="L10453">with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her</li>
<li class="L10454" rel="L10454">replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the</li>
<li class="L10455" rel="L10455">world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led</li>
<li class="L10456" rel="L10456">voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for</li>
<li class="L10457" rel="L10457">the world.</li>
<li class="L10458" rel="L10458"></li>
<li class="L10459" rel="L10459">“Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went away;</li>
<li class="L10460" rel="L10460">it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things</li>
<li class="L10461" rel="L10461">enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure</li>
<li class="L10462" rel="L10462">I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I</li>
<li class="L10463" rel="L10463">thought it would be very good fun if I was.”</li>
<li class="L10464" rel="L10464"></li>
<li class="L10465" rel="L10465">Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked</li>
<li class="L10466" rel="L10466">expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of</li>
<li class="L10467" rel="L10467">which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, “Oh! mamma, do the</li>
<li class="L10468" rel="L10468">people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not;</li>
<li class="L10469" rel="L10469">and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he</li>
<li class="L10470" rel="L10470">should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took</li>
<li class="L10471" rel="L10471">off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that</li>
<li class="L10472" rel="L10472">he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.”</li>
<li class="L10473" rel="L10473"></li>
<li class="L10474" rel="L10474">Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room;</li>
<li class="L10475" rel="L10475">and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to</li>
<li class="L10476" rel="L10476">the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with</li>
<li class="L10477" rel="L10477">anxious parade, walk up to her mother&#39;s right hand, and hear her say</li>
<li class="L10478" rel="L10478">to her eldest sister, “Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go</li>
<li class="L10479" rel="L10479">lower, because I am a married woman.”</li>
<li class="L10480" rel="L10480"></li>
<li class="L10481" rel="L10481">It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment</li>
<li class="L10482" rel="L10482">from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good</li>
<li class="L10483" rel="L10483">spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and</li>
<li class="L10484" rel="L10484">all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham”</li>
<li class="L10485" rel="L10485"> by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her</li>
<li class="L10486" rel="L10486">ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.</li>
<li class="L10487" rel="L10487"></li>
<li class="L10488" rel="L10488">“Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast</li>
<li class="L10489" rel="L10489">room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I</li>
<li class="L10490" rel="L10490">am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half</li>
<li class="L10491" rel="L10491">my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get</li>
<li class="L10492" rel="L10492">husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.”</li>
<li class="L10493" rel="L10493"></li>
<li class="L10494" rel="L10494">“Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don&#39;t</li>
<li class="L10495" rel="L10495">at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”</li>
<li class="L10496" rel="L10496"></li>
<li class="L10497" rel="L10497">“Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all</li>
<li class="L10498" rel="L10498">things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We</li>
<li class="L10499" rel="L10499">shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some</li>
<li class="L10500" rel="L10500">balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.”</li>
<li class="L10501" rel="L10501"></li>
<li class="L10502" rel="L10502">“I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.</li>
<li class="L10503" rel="L10503"></li>
<li class="L10504" rel="L10504">“And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters</li>
<li class="L10505" rel="L10505">behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the</li>
<li class="L10506" rel="L10506">winter is over.”</li>
<li class="L10507" rel="L10507"></li>
<li class="L10508" rel="L10508">“I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do not</li>
<li class="L10509" rel="L10509">particularly like your way of getting husbands.”</li>
<li class="L10510" rel="L10510"></li>
<li class="L10511" rel="L10511">Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham</li>
<li class="L10512" rel="L10512">had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join</li>
<li class="L10513" rel="L10513">his regiment at the end of a fortnight.</li>
<li class="L10514" rel="L10514"></li>
<li class="L10515" rel="L10515">No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and</li>
<li class="L10516" rel="L10516">she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and</li>
<li class="L10517" rel="L10517">having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to</li>
<li class="L10518" rel="L10518">all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did</li>
<li class="L10519" rel="L10519">think, than such as did not.</li>
<li class="L10520" rel="L10520"></li>
<li class="L10521" rel="L10521">Wickham&#39;s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected</li>
<li class="L10522" rel="L10522">to find it; not equal to Lydia&#39;s for him. She had scarcely needed her</li>
<li class="L10523" rel="L10523">present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that</li>
<li class="L10524" rel="L10524">their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather</li>
<li class="L10525" rel="L10525">than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring</li>
<li class="L10526" rel="L10526">for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain</li>
<li class="L10527" rel="L10527">that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and</li>
<li class="L10528" rel="L10528">if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity</li>
<li class="L10529" rel="L10529">of having a companion.</li>
<li class="L10530" rel="L10530"></li>
<li class="L10531" rel="L10531">Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every</li>
<li class="L10532" rel="L10532">occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every</li>
<li class="L10533" rel="L10533">thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on</li>
<li class="L10534" rel="L10534">the first of September, than any body else in the country.</li>
<li class="L10535" rel="L10535"></li>
<li class="L10536" rel="L10536">One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two</li>
<li class="L10537" rel="L10537">elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:</li>
<li class="L10538" rel="L10538"></li>
<li class="L10539" rel="L10539">“Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You</li>
<li class="L10540" rel="L10540">were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you</li>
<li class="L10541" rel="L10541">curious to hear how it was managed?”</li>
<li class="L10542" rel="L10542"></li>
<li class="L10543" rel="L10543">“No really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little said</li>
<li class="L10544" rel="L10544">on the subject.”</li>
<li class="L10545" rel="L10545"></li>
<li class="L10546" rel="L10546">“La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were</li>
<li class="L10547" rel="L10547">married, you know, at St. Clement&#39;s, because Wickham&#39;s lodgings were in</li>
<li class="L10548" rel="L10548">that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven</li>
<li class="L10549" rel="L10549">o&#39;clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others</li>
<li class="L10550" rel="L10550">were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in</li>
<li class="L10551" rel="L10551">such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to</li>
<li class="L10552" rel="L10552">put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was</li>
<li class="L10553" rel="L10553">my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as</li>
<li class="L10554" rel="L10554">if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in</li>
<li class="L10555" rel="L10555">ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed</li>
<li class="L10556" rel="L10556">to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.”</li>
<li class="L10557" rel="L10557"></li>
<li class="L10558" rel="L10558">“Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never</li>
<li class="L10559" rel="L10559">be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt</li>
<li class="L10560" rel="L10560">were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you&#39;ll believe</li>
<li class="L10561" rel="L10561">me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a</li>
<li class="L10562" rel="L10562">fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was</li>
<li class="L10563" rel="L10563">rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so</li>
<li class="L10564" rel="L10564">just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon</li>
<li class="L10565" rel="L10565">business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once</li>
<li class="L10566" rel="L10566">they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I</li>
<li class="L10567" rel="L10567">did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we</li>
<li class="L10568" rel="L10568">were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he</li>
<li class="L10569" rel="L10569">came back again in ten minutes&#39; time, and then we all set out. However,</li>
<li class="L10570" rel="L10570">I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the</li>
<li class="L10571" rel="L10571">wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.”</li>
<li class="L10572" rel="L10572"></li>
<li class="L10573" rel="L10573">“Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.</li>
<li class="L10574" rel="L10574"></li>
<li class="L10575" rel="L10575">“Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious</li>
<li class="L10576" rel="L10576">me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised</li>
<li class="L10577" rel="L10577">them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!”</li>
<li class="L10578" rel="L10578"></li>
<li class="L10579" rel="L10579">“If it was to be secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the</li>
<li class="L10580" rel="L10580">subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.”</li>
<li class="L10581" rel="L10581"></li>
<li class="L10582" rel="L10582">“Oh! certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we will</li>
<li class="L10583" rel="L10583">ask you no questions.”</li>
<li class="L10584" rel="L10584"></li>
<li class="L10585" rel="L10585">“Thank you,” said Lydia, “for if you did, I should certainly tell you</li>
<li class="L10586" rel="L10586">all, and then Wickham would be angry.”</li>
<li class="L10587" rel="L10587"></li>
<li class="L10588" rel="L10588">On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her</li>
<li class="L10589" rel="L10589">power, by running away.</li>
<li class="L10590" rel="L10590"></li>
<li class="L10591" rel="L10591">But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least</li>
<li class="L10592" rel="L10592">it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at</li>
<li class="L10593" rel="L10593">her sister&#39;s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,</li>
<li class="L10594" rel="L10594">where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.</li>
<li class="L10595" rel="L10595">Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her</li>
<li class="L10596" rel="L10596">brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as</li>
<li class="L10597" rel="L10597">placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She</li>
<li class="L10598" rel="L10598">could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,</li>
<li class="L10599" rel="L10599">wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what</li>
<li class="L10600" rel="L10600">Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been</li>
<li class="L10601" rel="L10601">intended.</li>
<li class="L10602" rel="L10602"></li>
<li class="L10603" rel="L10603">“You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be</li>
<li class="L10604" rel="L10604">to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively</li>
<li class="L10605" rel="L10605">speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such</li>
<li class="L10606" rel="L10606">a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,</li>
<li class="L10607" rel="L10607">for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems</li>
<li class="L10608" rel="L10608">to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with</li>
<li class="L10609" rel="L10609">ignorance.”</li>
<li class="L10610" rel="L10610"></li>
<li class="L10611" rel="L10611">“Not that I _shall_, though,” she added to herself, as she finished</li>
<li class="L10612" rel="L10612">the letter; “and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable</li>
<li class="L10613" rel="L10613">manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it</li>
<li class="L10614" rel="L10614">out.”</li>
<li class="L10615" rel="L10615"></li>
<li class="L10616" rel="L10616">Jane&#39;s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to</li>
<li class="L10617" rel="L10617">Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad</li>
<li class="L10618" rel="L10618">of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any</li>
<li class="L10619" rel="L10619">satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.</li>

<li class="L10625" rel="L10625"></li>
<li class="L10626" rel="L10626">Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as</li>
<li class="L10627" rel="L10627">soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it</li>
<li class="L10628" rel="L10628">than, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to</li>
<li class="L10629" rel="L10629">be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to</li>
<li class="L10630" rel="L10630">be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not</li>
<li class="L10631" rel="L10631">contain a denial.</li>

<li class="L10634" rel="L10634"></li>
<li class="L10635" rel="L10635">“MY DEAR NIECE,</li>
<li class="L10636" rel="L10636"></li>
<li class="L10637" rel="L10637">“I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning</li>
<li class="L10638" rel="L10638">to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise</li>
<li class="L10639" rel="L10639">what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your</li>
<li class="L10640" rel="L10640">application; I did not expect it from _you_. Don&#39;t think me angry,</li>
<li class="L10641" rel="L10641">however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such</li>
<li class="L10642" rel="L10642">inquiries to be necessary on _your_ side. If you do not choose to</li>
<li class="L10643" rel="L10643">understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised</li>
<li class="L10644" rel="L10644">as I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned</li>
<li class="L10645" rel="L10645">would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really</li>
<li class="L10646" rel="L10646">innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.</li>
<li class="L10647" rel="L10647"></li>
<li class="L10648" rel="L10648">“On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most</li>
<li class="L10649" rel="L10649">unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several</li>
<li class="L10650" rel="L10650">hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so</li>
<li class="L10651" rel="L10651">dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr.</li>
<li class="L10652" rel="L10652">Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were,</li>
<li class="L10653" rel="L10653">and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly,</li>
<li class="L10654" rel="L10654">Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day</li>
<li class="L10655" rel="L10655">after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for</li>
<li class="L10656" rel="L10656">them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to</li>
<li class="L10657" rel="L10657">himself that Wickham&#39;s worthlessness had not been so well known as to</li>
<li class="L10658" rel="L10658">make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide</li>
<li class="L10659" rel="L10659">in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and</li>
<li class="L10660" rel="L10660">confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private</li>
<li class="L10661" rel="L10661">actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He</li>
<li class="L10662" rel="L10662">called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy</li>
<li class="L10663" rel="L10663">an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he _had another_</li>
<li class="L10664" rel="L10664">motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days</li>
<li class="L10665" rel="L10665">in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to</li>
<li class="L10666" rel="L10666">direct his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness</li>
<li class="L10667" rel="L10667">of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.</li>
<li class="L10668" rel="L10668"></li>
<li class="L10669" rel="L10669">“There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago</li>
<li class="L10670" rel="L10670">governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause</li>
<li class="L10671" rel="L10671">of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large</li>
<li class="L10672" rel="L10672">house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting</li>
<li class="L10673" rel="L10673">lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with</li>
<li class="L10674" rel="L10674">Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to</li>
<li class="L10675" rel="L10675">town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he</li>
<li class="L10676" rel="L10676">wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and</li>
<li class="L10677" rel="L10677">corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.</li>
<li class="L10678" rel="L10678">Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had</li>
<li class="L10679" rel="L10679">she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up</li>
<li class="L10680" rel="L10680">their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the</li>
<li class="L10681" rel="L10681">wished-for direction. They were in ---- street. He saw Wickham, and</li>
<li class="L10682" rel="L10682">afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he</li>
<li class="L10683" rel="L10683">acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful</li>
<li class="L10684" rel="L10684">situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed</li>
<li class="L10685" rel="L10685">on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But</li>
<li class="L10686" rel="L10686">he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared</li>
<li class="L10687" rel="L10687">for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear</li>
<li class="L10688" rel="L10688">of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or</li>
<li class="L10689" rel="L10689">other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings,</li>
<li class="L10690" rel="L10690">it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which,</li>
<li class="L10691" rel="L10691">in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never</li>
<li class="L10692" rel="L10692">been _his_ design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment,</li>
<li class="L10693" rel="L10693">on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and</li>
<li class="L10694" rel="L10694">scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia&#39;s flight on her</li>
<li class="L10695" rel="L10695">own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as</li>
<li class="L10696" rel="L10696">to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He</li>
<li class="L10697" rel="L10697">must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have</li>
<li class="L10698" rel="L10698">nothing to live on.</li>
<li class="L10699" rel="L10699"></li>
<li class="L10700" rel="L10700">“Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though</li>
<li class="L10701" rel="L10701">Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able</li>
<li class="L10702" rel="L10702">to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by</li>
<li class="L10703" rel="L10703">marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still</li>
<li class="L10704" rel="L10704">cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in</li>
<li class="L10705" rel="L10705">some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely</li>
<li class="L10706" rel="L10706">to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.</li>
<li class="L10707" rel="L10707"></li>
<li class="L10708" rel="L10708">“They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of</li>
<li class="L10709" rel="L10709">course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be</li>
<li class="L10710" rel="L10710">reasonable.</li>
<li class="L10711" rel="L10711"></li>
<li class="L10712" rel="L10712">“Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy&#39;s next step was to</li>
<li class="L10713" rel="L10713">make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch</li>
<li class="L10714" rel="L10714">street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be</li>
<li class="L10715" rel="L10715">seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was</li>
<li class="L10716" rel="L10716">still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge</li>
<li class="L10717" rel="L10717">your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your</li>
<li class="L10718" rel="L10718">uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the</li>
<li class="L10719" rel="L10719">departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next</li>
<li class="L10720" rel="L10720">day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.</li>
<li class="L10721" rel="L10721"></li>
<li class="L10722" rel="L10722">“On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home,</li>
<li class="L10723" rel="L10723">and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.</li>
<li class="L10724" rel="L10724"></li>
<li class="L10725" rel="L10725">“They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It was not all</li>
<li class="L10726" rel="L10726">settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to</li>
<li class="L10727" rel="L10727">Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that</li>
<li class="L10728" rel="L10728">obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been</li>
<li class="L10729" rel="L10729">accused of many faults at different times, but _this_ is the true one.</li>
<li class="L10730" rel="L10730">Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and</li>
<li class="L10731" rel="L10731">I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your</li>
<li class="L10732" rel="L10732">uncle would most readily have settled the whole.</li>
<li class="L10733" rel="L10733"></li>
<li class="L10734" rel="L10734">“They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either</li>
<li class="L10735" rel="L10735">the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle</li>
<li class="L10736" rel="L10736">was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his</li>
<li class="L10737" rel="L10737">niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,</li>
<li class="L10738" rel="L10738">which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter</li>
<li class="L10739" rel="L10739">this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation</li>
<li class="L10740" rel="L10740">that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where</li>
<li class="L10741" rel="L10741">it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane</li>
<li class="L10742" rel="L10742">at most.</li>
<li class="L10743" rel="L10743"></li>
<li class="L10744" rel="L10744">“You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young</li>
<li class="L10745" rel="L10745">people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably</li>
<li class="L10746" rel="L10746">more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own</li>
<li class="L10747" rel="L10747">settled upon _her_, and his commission purchased. The reason why all</li>
<li class="L10748" rel="L10748">this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It</li>
<li class="L10749" rel="L10749">was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that</li>
<li class="L10750" rel="L10750">Wickham&#39;s character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he</li>
<li class="L10751" rel="L10751">had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth</li>
<li class="L10752" rel="L10752">in _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody&#39;s_ reserve,</li>
<li class="L10753" rel="L10753">can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking,</li>
<li class="L10754" rel="L10754">my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would</li>
<li class="L10755" rel="L10755">never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another</li>
<li class="L10756" rel="L10756">interest_ in the affair.</li>
<li class="L10757" rel="L10757"></li>
<li class="L10758" rel="L10758">“When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who</li>
<li class="L10759" rel="L10759">were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in</li>
<li class="L10760" rel="L10760">London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were</li>
<li class="L10761" rel="L10761">then to receive the last finish.</li>
<li class="L10762" rel="L10762"></li>
<li class="L10763" rel="L10763">“I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which</li>
<li class="L10764" rel="L10764">you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not</li>
<li class="L10765" rel="L10765">afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant</li>
<li class="L10766" rel="L10766">admission to the house. _He_ was exactly what he had been, when I</li>
<li class="L10767" rel="L10767">knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was</li>
<li class="L10768" rel="L10768">satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not</li>
<li class="L10769" rel="L10769">perceived, by Jane&#39;s letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming</li>
<li class="L10770" rel="L10770">home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell</li>
<li class="L10771" rel="L10771">you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most</li>
<li class="L10772" rel="L10772">serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had</li>
<li class="L10773" rel="L10773">done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she</li>
<li class="L10774" rel="L10774">heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was</li>
<li class="L10775" rel="L10775">sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and</li>
<li class="L10776" rel="L10776">Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.</li>
<li class="L10777" rel="L10777"></li>
<li class="L10778" rel="L10778">“Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,</li>
<li class="L10779" rel="L10779">attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave</li>
<li class="L10780" rel="L10780">town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my</li>
<li class="L10781" rel="L10781">dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold</li>
<li class="L10782" rel="L10782">enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,</li>
<li class="L10783" rel="L10783">in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His</li>
<li class="L10784" rel="L10784">understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little</li>
<li class="L10785" rel="L10785">more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach</li>
<li class="L10786" rel="L10786">him. I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name. But</li>
<li class="L10787" rel="L10787">slyness seems the fashion.</li>
<li class="L10788" rel="L10788"></li>
<li class="L10789" rel="L10789">“Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not</li>
<li class="L10790" rel="L10790">punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy</li>
<li class="L10791" rel="L10791">till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little</li>
<li class="L10792" rel="L10792">pair of ponies, would be the very thing.</li>
<li class="L10793" rel="L10793"></li>
<li class="L10794" rel="L10794">“But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half</li>
<li class="L10795" rel="L10795">hour.</li>
<li class="L10796" rel="L10796"></li>
<li class="L10797" rel="L10797">“Yours, very sincerely,</li>
<li class="L10798" rel="L10798"></li>
<li class="L10799" rel="L10799">“M. GARDINER.”</li>
<li class="L10800" rel="L10800"></li>
<li class="L10801" rel="L10801">The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,</li>
<li class="L10802" rel="L10802">in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the</li>
<li class="L10803" rel="L10803">greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had</li>
<li class="L10804" rel="L10804">produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister&#39;s</li>
<li class="L10805" rel="L10805">match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too</li>
<li class="L10806" rel="L10806">great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the</li>
<li class="L10807" rel="L10807">pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!</li>
<li class="L10808" rel="L10808">He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all</li>
<li class="L10809" rel="L10809">the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which</li>
<li class="L10810" rel="L10810">supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and</li>
<li class="L10811" rel="L10811">despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason</li>
<li class="L10812" rel="L10812">with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to</li>
<li class="L10813" rel="L10813">avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had</li>
<li class="L10814" rel="L10814">done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her</li>
<li class="L10815" rel="L10815">heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly</li>
<li class="L10816" rel="L10816">checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity</li>
<li class="L10817" rel="L10817">was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her--for</li>
<li class="L10818" rel="L10818">a woman who had already refused him--as able to overcome a sentiment so</li>
<li class="L10819" rel="L10819">natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law</li>
<li class="L10820" rel="L10820">of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had,</li>
<li class="L10821" rel="L10821">to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had</li>
<li class="L10822" rel="L10822">given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary</li>
<li class="L10823" rel="L10823">stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been</li>
<li class="L10824" rel="L10824">wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and</li>
<li class="L10825" rel="L10825">though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she</li>
<li class="L10826" rel="L10826">could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist</li>
<li class="L10827" rel="L10827">his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially</li>
<li class="L10828" rel="L10828">concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were</li>
<li class="L10829" rel="L10829">under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They</li>
<li class="L10830" rel="L10830">owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh!</li>
<li class="L10831" rel="L10831">how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever</li>
<li class="L10832" rel="L10832">encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For</li>
<li class="L10833" rel="L10833">herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause</li>
<li class="L10834" rel="L10834">of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.</li>
<li class="L10835" rel="L10835">She read over her aunt&#39;s commendation of him again and again. It</li>
<li class="L10836" rel="L10836">was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some</li>
<li class="L10837" rel="L10837">pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she</li>
<li class="L10838" rel="L10838">and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted</li>
<li class="L10839" rel="L10839">between Mr. Darcy and herself.</li>
<li class="L10840" rel="L10840"></li>
<li class="L10841" rel="L10841">She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one&#39;s</li>
<li class="L10842" rel="L10842">approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was</li>
<li class="L10843" rel="L10843">overtaken by Wickham.</li>
<li class="L10844" rel="L10844"></li>
<li class="L10845" rel="L10845">“I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said he,</li>
<li class="L10846" rel="L10846">as he joined her.</li>
<li class="L10847" rel="L10847"></li>
<li class="L10848" rel="L10848">“You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not follow</li>
<li class="L10849" rel="L10849">that the interruption must be unwelcome.”</li>
<li class="L10850" rel="L10850"></li>
<li class="L10851" rel="L10851">“I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and</li>
<li class="L10852" rel="L10852">now we are better.”</li>
<li class="L10853" rel="L10853"></li>
<li class="L10854" rel="L10854">“True. Are the others coming out?”</li>
<li class="L10855" rel="L10855"></li>
<li class="L10856" rel="L10856">“I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to</li>
<li class="L10857" rel="L10857">Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that</li>
<li class="L10858" rel="L10858">you have actually seen Pemberley.”</li>
<li class="L10859" rel="L10859"></li>
<li class="L10860" rel="L10860">She replied in the affirmative.</li>
<li class="L10861" rel="L10861"></li>
<li class="L10862" rel="L10862">“I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much</li>
<li class="L10863" rel="L10863">for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the</li>
<li class="L10864" rel="L10864">old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of</li>
<li class="L10865" rel="L10865">me. But of course she did not mention my name to you.”</li>
<li class="L10866" rel="L10866"></li>
<li class="L10867" rel="L10867">“Yes, she did.”</li>
<li class="L10868" rel="L10868"></li>
<li class="L10869" rel="L10869">“And what did she say?”</li>
<li class="L10870" rel="L10870"></li>
<li class="L10871" rel="L10871">“That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned</li>
<li class="L10872" rel="L10872">out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely</li>
<li class="L10873" rel="L10873">misrepresented.”</li>
<li class="L10874" rel="L10874"></li>
<li class="L10875" rel="L10875">“Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had</li>
<li class="L10876" rel="L10876">silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:</li>
<li class="L10877" rel="L10877"></li>
<li class="L10878" rel="L10878">“I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other</li>
<li class="L10879" rel="L10879">several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.”</li>
<li class="L10880" rel="L10880"></li>
<li class="L10881" rel="L10881">“Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said</li>
<li class="L10882" rel="L10882">Elizabeth. “It must be something particular, to take him there at this</li>
<li class="L10883" rel="L10883">time of year.”</li>
<li class="L10884" rel="L10884"></li>
<li class="L10885" rel="L10885">“Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I</li>
<li class="L10886" rel="L10886">understood from the Gardiners that you had.”</li>
<li class="L10887" rel="L10887"></li>
<li class="L10888" rel="L10888">“Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”</li>
<li class="L10889" rel="L10889"></li>
<li class="L10890" rel="L10890">“And do you like her?”</li>
<li class="L10891" rel="L10891"></li>
<li class="L10892" rel="L10892">“Very much.”</li>
<li class="L10893" rel="L10893"></li>
<li class="L10894" rel="L10894">“I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year</li>
<li class="L10895" rel="L10895">or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad</li>
<li class="L10896" rel="L10896">you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.”</li>
<li class="L10897" rel="L10897"></li>
<li class="L10898" rel="L10898">“I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”</li>
<li class="L10899" rel="L10899"></li>
<li class="L10900" rel="L10900">“Did you go by the village of Kympton?”</li>
<li class="L10901" rel="L10901"></li>
<li class="L10902" rel="L10902">“I do not recollect that we did.”</li>
<li class="L10903" rel="L10903"></li>
<li class="L10904" rel="L10904">“I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A</li>
<li class="L10905" rel="L10905">most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited</li>
<li class="L10906" rel="L10906">me in every respect.”</li>
<li class="L10907" rel="L10907"></li>
<li class="L10908" rel="L10908">“How should you have liked making sermons?”</li>
<li class="L10909" rel="L10909"></li>
<li class="L10910" rel="L10910">“Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty,</li>
<li class="L10911" rel="L10911">and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to</li>
<li class="L10912" rel="L10912">repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The</li>
<li class="L10913" rel="L10913">quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas</li>
<li class="L10914" rel="L10914">of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the</li>
<li class="L10915" rel="L10915">circumstance, when you were in Kent?”</li>
<li class="L10916" rel="L10916"></li>
<li class="L10917" rel="L10917">“I have heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was</li>
<li class="L10918" rel="L10918">left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”</li>
<li class="L10919" rel="L10919"></li>
<li class="L10920" rel="L10920">“You have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the</li>
<li class="L10921" rel="L10921">first, you may remember.”</li>
<li class="L10922" rel="L10922"></li>
<li class="L10923" rel="L10923">“I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not</li>
<li class="L10924" rel="L10924">so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually</li>
<li class="L10925" rel="L10925">declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business</li>
<li class="L10926" rel="L10926">had been compromised accordingly.”</li>
<li class="L10927" rel="L10927"></li>
<li class="L10928" rel="L10928">“You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember</li>
<li class="L10929" rel="L10929">what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.”</li>
<li class="L10930" rel="L10930"></li>
<li class="L10931" rel="L10931">They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast</li>
<li class="L10932" rel="L10932">to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister&#39;s sake, to provoke him,</li>
<li class="L10933" rel="L10933">she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:</li>
<li class="L10934" rel="L10934"></li>
<li class="L10935" rel="L10935">“Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let</li>
<li class="L10936" rel="L10936">us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one</li>
<li class="L10937" rel="L10937">mind.”</li>
<li class="L10938" rel="L10938"></li>
<li class="L10939" rel="L10939">She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though</li>
<li class="L10940" rel="L10940">he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.</li>

<li class="L10946" rel="L10946"></li>
<li class="L10947" rel="L10947">Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he</li>
<li class="L10948" rel="L10948">never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,</li>
<li class="L10949" rel="L10949">by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she</li>
<li class="L10950" rel="L10950">had said enough to keep him quiet.</li>
<li class="L10951" rel="L10951"></li>
<li class="L10952" rel="L10952">The day of his and Lydia&#39;s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was</li>
<li class="L10953" rel="L10953">forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means</li>
<li class="L10954" rel="L10954">entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to</li>
<li class="L10955" rel="L10955">continue at least a twelvemonth.</li>
<li class="L10956" rel="L10956"></li>
<li class="L10957" rel="L10957">“Oh! my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”</li>
<li class="L10958" rel="L10958"></li>
<li class="L10959" rel="L10959">“Oh, lord! I don&#39;t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”</li>
<li class="L10960" rel="L10960"></li>
<li class="L10961" rel="L10961">“Write to me very often, my dear.”</li>
<li class="L10962" rel="L10962"></li>
<li class="L10963" rel="L10963">“As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for</li>
<li class="L10964" rel="L10964">writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to</li>
<li class="L10965" rel="L10965">do.”</li>
<li class="L10966" rel="L10966"></li>
<li class="L10967" rel="L10967">Mr. Wickham&#39;s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife&#39;s. He</li>
<li class="L10968" rel="L10968">smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.</li>
<li class="L10969" rel="L10969"></li>
<li class="L10970" rel="L10970">“He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of</li>
<li class="L10971" rel="L10971">the house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to</li>
<li class="L10972" rel="L10972">us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas</li>
<li class="L10973" rel="L10973">himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”</li>
<li class="L10974" rel="L10974"></li>
<li class="L10975" rel="L10975">The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.</li>
<li class="L10976" rel="L10976"></li>
<li class="L10977" rel="L10977">“I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with</li>
<li class="L10978" rel="L10978">one&#39;s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”</li>
<li class="L10979" rel="L10979"></li>
<li class="L10980" rel="L10980">“This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,” said</li>
<li class="L10981" rel="L10981">Elizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied that your other four are</li>
<li class="L10982" rel="L10982">single.”</li>
<li class="L10983" rel="L10983"></li>
<li class="L10984" rel="L10984">“It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married,</li>
<li class="L10985" rel="L10985">but only because her husband&#39;s regiment happens to be so far off. If</li>
<li class="L10986" rel="L10986">that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”</li>
<li class="L10987" rel="L10987"></li>
<li class="L10988" rel="L10988">But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly</li>
<li class="L10989" rel="L10989">relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an</li>
<li class="L10990" rel="L10990">article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper</li>
<li class="L10991" rel="L10991">at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her</li>
<li class="L10992" rel="L10992">master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several</li>
<li class="L10993" rel="L10993">weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and</li>
<li class="L10994" rel="L10994">smiled and shook her head by turns.</li>
<li class="L10995" rel="L10995"></li>
<li class="L10996" rel="L10996">“Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs.</li>
<li class="L10997" rel="L10997">Phillips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the better. Not</li>
<li class="L10998" rel="L10998">that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am</li>
<li class="L10999" rel="L10999">sure _I_ never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome</li>
<li class="L11000" rel="L11000">to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen?</li>
<li class="L11001" rel="L11001">But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to</li>
<li class="L11002" rel="L11002">mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?”</li>
<li class="L11003" rel="L11003"></li>
<li class="L11004" rel="L11004">“You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nicholls was in</li>
<li class="L11005" rel="L11005">Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose</li>
<li class="L11006" rel="L11006">to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He</li>
<li class="L11007" rel="L11007">comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was</li>
<li class="L11008" rel="L11008">going to the butcher&#39;s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on</li>
<li class="L11009" rel="L11009">Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”</li>
<li class="L11010" rel="L11010"></li>
<li class="L11011" rel="L11011">Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing</li>
<li class="L11012" rel="L11012">colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to</li>
<li class="L11013" rel="L11013">Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:</li>
<li class="L11014" rel="L11014"></li>
<li class="L11015" rel="L11015">“I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present</li>
<li class="L11016" rel="L11016">report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don&#39;t imagine it was from</li>
<li class="L11017" rel="L11017">any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that</li>
<li class="L11018" rel="L11018">I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect</li>
<li class="L11019" rel="L11019">me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes</li>
<li class="L11020" rel="L11020">alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of</li>
<li class="L11021" rel="L11021">_myself_, but I dread other people&#39;s remarks.”</li>
<li class="L11022" rel="L11022"></li>
<li class="L11023" rel="L11023">Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in</li>
<li class="L11024" rel="L11024">Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no</li>
<li class="L11025" rel="L11025">other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial</li>
<li class="L11026" rel="L11026">to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming</li>
<li class="L11027" rel="L11027">there _with_ his friend&#39;s permission, or being bold enough to come</li>
<li class="L11028" rel="L11028">without it.</li>
<li class="L11029" rel="L11029"></li>
<li class="L11030" rel="L11030">“Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot</li>
<li class="L11031" rel="L11031">come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this</li>
<li class="L11032" rel="L11032">speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.”</li>
<li class="L11033" rel="L11033"></li>
<li class="L11034" rel="L11034">In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her</li>
<li class="L11035" rel="L11035">feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily</li>
<li class="L11036" rel="L11036">perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,</li>
<li class="L11037" rel="L11037">more unequal, than she had often seen them.</li>
<li class="L11038" rel="L11038"></li>
<li class="L11039" rel="L11039">The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,</li>
<li class="L11040" rel="L11040">about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.</li>
<li class="L11041" rel="L11041"></li>
<li class="L11042" rel="L11042">“As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you</li>
<li class="L11043" rel="L11043">will wait on him of course.”</li>
<li class="L11044" rel="L11044"></li>
<li class="L11045" rel="L11045">“No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I</li>
<li class="L11046" rel="L11046">went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in</li>
<li class="L11047" rel="L11047">nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool&#39;s errand again.”</li>
<li class="L11048" rel="L11048"></li>
<li class="L11049" rel="L11049">His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention</li>
<li class="L11050" rel="L11050">would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to</li>
<li class="L11051" rel="L11051">Netherfield.</li>
<li class="L11052" rel="L11052"></li>
<li class="L11053" rel="L11053">“&#39;Tis an etiquette I despise,” said he. “If he wants our society,</li>
<li class="L11054" rel="L11054">let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours</li>
<li class="L11055" rel="L11055">in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back</li>
<li class="L11056" rel="L11056">again.”</li>
<li class="L11057" rel="L11057"></li>
<li class="L11058" rel="L11058">“Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait</li>
<li class="L11059" rel="L11059">on him. But, however, that shan&#39;t prevent my asking him to dine here, I</li>
<li class="L11060" rel="L11060">am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will</li>
<li class="L11061" rel="L11061">make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for</li>
<li class="L11062" rel="L11062">him.”</li>
<li class="L11063" rel="L11063"></li>
<li class="L11064" rel="L11064">Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her</li>
<li class="L11065" rel="L11065">husband&#39;s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her</li>
<li class="L11066" rel="L11066">neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before</li>
<li class="L11067" rel="L11067">_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--</li>
<li class="L11068" rel="L11068"></li>
<li class="L11069" rel="L11069">“I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It</li>
<li class="L11070" rel="L11070">would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can</li>
<li class="L11071" rel="L11071">hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;</li>
<li class="L11072" rel="L11072">but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she</li>
<li class="L11073" rel="L11073">says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!”</li>
<li class="L11074" rel="L11074"></li>
<li class="L11075" rel="L11075">“I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it</li>
<li class="L11076" rel="L11076">is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction</li>
<li class="L11077" rel="L11077">of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have</li>
<li class="L11078" rel="L11078">always so much.”</li>
<li class="L11079" rel="L11079"></li>
<li class="L11080" rel="L11080">Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,</li>
<li class="L11081" rel="L11081">contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety</li>
<li class="L11082" rel="L11082">and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted</li>
<li class="L11083" rel="L11083">the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;</li>
<li class="L11084" rel="L11084">hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his</li>
<li class="L11085" rel="L11085">arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,</li>
<li class="L11086" rel="L11086">enter the paddock and ride towards the house.</li>
<li class="L11087" rel="L11087"></li>
<li class="L11088" rel="L11088">Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely</li>
<li class="L11089" rel="L11089">kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went</li>
<li class="L11090" rel="L11090">to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down</li>
<li class="L11091" rel="L11091">again by her sister.</li>
<li class="L11092" rel="L11092"></li>
<li class="L11093" rel="L11093">“There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”</li>
<li class="L11094" rel="L11094"></li>
<li class="L11095" rel="L11095">“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not</li>
<li class="L11096" rel="L11096">know.”</li>
<li class="L11097" rel="L11097"></li>
<li class="L11098" rel="L11098">“La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with</li>
<li class="L11099" rel="L11099">him before. Mr. what&#39;s-his-name. That tall, proud man.”</li>
<li class="L11100" rel="L11100"></li>
<li class="L11101" rel="L11101">“Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of</li>
<li class="L11102" rel="L11102">Mr. Bingley&#39;s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must</li>
<li class="L11103" rel="L11103">say that I hate the very sight of him.”</li>
<li class="L11104" rel="L11104"></li>
<li class="L11105" rel="L11105">Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little</li>
<li class="L11106" rel="L11106">of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness</li>
<li class="L11107" rel="L11107">which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time</li>
<li class="L11108" rel="L11108">after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable</li>
<li class="L11109" rel="L11109">enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their</li>
<li class="L11110" rel="L11110">mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be</li>
<li class="L11111" rel="L11111">civil to him only as Mr. Bingley&#39;s friend, without being heard by either</li>
<li class="L11112" rel="L11112">of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be</li>
<li class="L11113" rel="L11113">suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.</li>
<li class="L11114" rel="L11114">Gardiner&#39;s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.</li>
<li class="L11115" rel="L11115">To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,</li>
<li class="L11116" rel="L11116">and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive</li>
<li class="L11117" rel="L11117">information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted</li>
<li class="L11118" rel="L11118">for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an</li>
<li class="L11119" rel="L11119">interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as</li>
<li class="L11120" rel="L11120">what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his</li>
<li class="L11121" rel="L11121">coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,</li>
<li class="L11122" rel="L11122">was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered</li>
<li class="L11123" rel="L11123">behaviour in Derbyshire.</li>
<li class="L11124" rel="L11124"></li>
<li class="L11125" rel="L11125">The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a</li>
<li class="L11126" rel="L11126">minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to</li>
<li class="L11127" rel="L11127">her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and</li>
<li class="L11128" rel="L11128">wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.</li>
<li class="L11129" rel="L11129"></li>
<li class="L11130" rel="L11130">“Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early</li>
<li class="L11131" rel="L11131">enough for expectation.”</li>
<li class="L11132" rel="L11132"></li>
<li class="L11133" rel="L11133">She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to</li>
<li class="L11134" rel="L11134">lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of</li>
<li class="L11135" rel="L11135">her sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little</li>
<li class="L11136" rel="L11136">paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the</li>
<li class="L11137" rel="L11137">gentlemen&#39;s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with</li>
<li class="L11138" rel="L11138">tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any</li>
<li class="L11139" rel="L11139">symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.</li>
<li class="L11140" rel="L11140"></li>
<li class="L11141" rel="L11141">Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down</li>
<li class="L11142" rel="L11142">again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She</li>
<li class="L11143" rel="L11143">had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and,</li>
<li class="L11144" rel="L11144">she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as</li>
<li class="L11145" rel="L11145">she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother&#39;s</li>
<li class="L11146" rel="L11146">presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but</li>
<li class="L11147" rel="L11147">not an improbable, conjecture.</li>
<li class="L11148" rel="L11148"></li>
<li class="L11149" rel="L11149">Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period</li>
<li class="L11150" rel="L11150">saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.</li>
<li class="L11151" rel="L11151">Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,</li>
<li class="L11152" rel="L11152">especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of</li>
<li class="L11153" rel="L11153">her curtsey and address to his friend.</li>
<li class="L11154" rel="L11154"></li>
<li class="L11155" rel="L11155">Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter</li>
<li class="L11156" rel="L11156">the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy,</li>
<li class="L11157" rel="L11157">was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill</li>
<li class="L11158" rel="L11158">applied.</li>
<li class="L11159" rel="L11159"></li>
<li class="L11160" rel="L11160">Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question</li>
<li class="L11161" rel="L11161">which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He</li>
<li class="L11162" rel="L11162">was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but</li>
<li class="L11163" rel="L11163">it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends,</li>
<li class="L11164" rel="L11164">when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without</li>
<li class="L11165" rel="L11165">bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist</li>
<li class="L11166" rel="L11166">the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often</li>
<li class="L11167" rel="L11167">found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but</li>
<li class="L11168" rel="L11168">the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when</li>
<li class="L11169" rel="L11169">they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry</li>
<li class="L11170" rel="L11170">with herself for being so.</li>
<li class="L11171" rel="L11171"></li>
<li class="L11172" rel="L11172">“Could I expect it to be otherwise!” said she. “Yet why did he come?”</li>
<li class="L11173" rel="L11173"></li>
<li class="L11174" rel="L11174">She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to</li>
<li class="L11175" rel="L11175">him she had hardly courage to speak.</li>
<li class="L11176" rel="L11176"></li>
<li class="L11177" rel="L11177">She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.</li>
<li class="L11178" rel="L11178"></li>
<li class="L11179" rel="L11179">“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.</li>
<li class="L11180" rel="L11180"></li>
<li class="L11181" rel="L11181">He readily agreed to it.</li>
<li class="L11182" rel="L11182"></li>
<li class="L11183" rel="L11183">“I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say</li>
<li class="L11184" rel="L11184">you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope</li>
<li class="L11185" rel="L11185">it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,</li>
<li class="L11186" rel="L11186">since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my</li>
<li class="L11187" rel="L11187">own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have</li>
<li class="L11188" rel="L11188">seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know;</li>
<li class="L11189" rel="L11189">though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, &#39;Lately,</li>
<li class="L11190" rel="L11190">George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,&#39; without there being a</li>
<li class="L11191" rel="L11191">syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.</li>
<li class="L11192" rel="L11192">It was my brother Gardiner&#39;s drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to</li>
<li class="L11193" rel="L11193">make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”</li>
<li class="L11194" rel="L11194"></li>
<li class="L11195" rel="L11195">Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth</li>
<li class="L11196" rel="L11196">dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could</li>
<li class="L11197" rel="L11197">not tell.</li>
<li class="L11198" rel="L11198"></li>
<li class="L11199" rel="L11199">“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,”</li>
<li class="L11200" rel="L11200"> continued her mother, “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very</li>
<li class="L11201" rel="L11201">hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to</li>
<li class="L11202" rel="L11202">Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay</li>
<li class="L11203" rel="L11203">I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have</li>
<li class="L11204" rel="L11204">heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the</li>
<li class="L11205" rel="L11205">regulars. Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so</li>
<li class="L11206" rel="L11206">many as he deserves.”</li>
<li class="L11207" rel="L11207"></li>
<li class="L11208" rel="L11208">Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such</li>
<li class="L11209" rel="L11209">misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her,</li>
<li class="L11210" rel="L11210">however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually</li>
<li class="L11211" rel="L11211">done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in</li>
<li class="L11212" rel="L11212">the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.</li>
<li class="L11213" rel="L11213"></li>
<li class="L11214" rel="L11214">“When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her mother,</li>
<li class="L11215" rel="L11215">“I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr.</li>
<li class="L11216" rel="L11216">Bennet&#39;s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and</li>
<li class="L11217" rel="L11217">will save all the best of the covies for you.”</li>
<li class="L11218" rel="L11218"></li>
<li class="L11219" rel="L11219">Elizabeth&#39;s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious</li>
<li class="L11220" rel="L11220">attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had</li>
<li class="L11221" rel="L11221">flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be</li>
<li class="L11222" rel="L11222">hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt</li>
<li class="L11223" rel="L11223">that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for</li>
<li class="L11224" rel="L11224">moments of such painful confusion.</li>
<li class="L11225" rel="L11225"></li>
<li class="L11226" rel="L11226">“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to</li>
<li class="L11227" rel="L11227">be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure</li>
<li class="L11228" rel="L11228">that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either</li>
<li class="L11229" rel="L11229">one or the other again!”</li>
<li class="L11230" rel="L11230"></li>
<li class="L11231" rel="L11231">Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no</li>
<li class="L11232" rel="L11232">compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing</li>
<li class="L11233" rel="L11233">how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her</li>
<li class="L11234" rel="L11234">former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;</li>
<li class="L11235" rel="L11235">but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He</li>
<li class="L11236" rel="L11236">found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and</li>
<li class="L11237" rel="L11237">as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no</li>
<li class="L11238" rel="L11238">difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded</li>
<li class="L11239" rel="L11239">that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged,</li>
<li class="L11240" rel="L11240">that she did not always know when she was silent.</li>
<li class="L11241" rel="L11241"></li>
<li class="L11242" rel="L11242">When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her</li>
<li class="L11243" rel="L11243">intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at</li>
<li class="L11244" rel="L11244">Longbourn in a few days time.</li>
<li class="L11245" rel="L11245"></li>
<li class="L11246" rel="L11246">“You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added, “for when</li>
<li class="L11247" rel="L11247">you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with</li>
<li class="L11248" rel="L11248">us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure</li>
<li class="L11249" rel="L11249">you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep</li>
<li class="L11250" rel="L11250">your engagement.”</li>
<li class="L11251" rel="L11251"></li>
<li class="L11252" rel="L11252">Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of</li>
<li class="L11253" rel="L11253">his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.</li>
<li class="L11254" rel="L11254"></li>
<li class="L11255" rel="L11255">Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine</li>
<li class="L11256" rel="L11256">there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did</li>
<li class="L11257" rel="L11257">not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man</li>
<li class="L11258" rel="L11258">on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride</li>
<li class="L11259" rel="L11259">of one who had ten thousand a year.</li>
<li class="L11260" rel="L11260"></li>
<li class="L11261" rel="L11261"></li>
<li class="L11262" rel="L11262"></li>
<li class="L11263" rel="L11263">Chapter 54</li>
<li class="L11264" rel="L11264"></li>
<li class="L11265" rel="L11265"></li>
<li class="L11266" rel="L11266">As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;</li>
<li class="L11267" rel="L11267">or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that</li>
<li class="L11268" rel="L11268">must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy&#39;s behaviour astonished and vexed her.</li>
<li class="L11269" rel="L11269"></li>
<li class="L11270" rel="L11270">“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she,</li>
<li class="L11271" rel="L11271">“did he come at all?”</li>
<li class="L11272" rel="L11272"></li>
<li class="L11273" rel="L11273">She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.</li>
<li class="L11274" rel="L11274"></li>
<li class="L11275" rel="L11275">“He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when</li>
<li class="L11276" rel="L11276">he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If</li>
<li class="L11277" rel="L11277">he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will</li>
<li class="L11278" rel="L11278">think no more about him.”</li>
<li class="L11279" rel="L11279"></li>
<li class="L11280" rel="L11280">Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach</li>
<li class="L11281" rel="L11281">of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her</li>
<li class="L11282" rel="L11282">better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.</li>
<li class="L11283" rel="L11283"></li>
<li class="L11284" rel="L11284">“Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly</li>
<li class="L11285" rel="L11285">easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by</li>
<li class="L11286" rel="L11286">his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly</li>
<li class="L11287" rel="L11287">seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent</li>
<li class="L11288" rel="L11288">acquaintance.”</li>
<li class="L11289" rel="L11289"></li>
<li class="L11290" rel="L11290">“Yes, very indifferent indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly. “Oh, Jane,</li>
<li class="L11291" rel="L11291">take care.”</li>
<li class="L11292" rel="L11292"></li>
<li class="L11293" rel="L11293">“My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?”</li>
<li class="L11294" rel="L11294"></li>
<li class="L11295" rel="L11295">“I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with</li>
<li class="L11296" rel="L11296">you as ever.”</li>
<li class="L11297" rel="L11297"></li>
<li class="L11298" rel="L11298">                          * * * * *</li>
<li class="L11299" rel="L11299"></li>
<li class="L11300" rel="L11300">They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in</li>
<li class="L11301" rel="L11301">the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good</li>
<li class="L11302" rel="L11302">humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour&#39;s visit, had</li>
<li class="L11303" rel="L11303">revived.</li>
<li class="L11304" rel="L11304"></li>
<li class="L11305" rel="L11305">On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two</li>
<li class="L11306" rel="L11306">who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality</li>
<li class="L11307" rel="L11307">as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the</li>
<li class="L11308" rel="L11308">dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take</li>
<li class="L11309" rel="L11309">the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by</li>
<li class="L11310" rel="L11310">her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore</li>
<li class="L11311" rel="L11311">to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to</li>
<li class="L11312" rel="L11312">hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was</li>
<li class="L11313" rel="L11313">decided. He placed himself by her.</li>
<li class="L11314" rel="L11314"></li>
<li class="L11315" rel="L11315">Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.</li>
<li class="L11316" rel="L11316">He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that</li>
<li class="L11317" rel="L11317">Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes</li>
<li class="L11318" rel="L11318">likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing</li>
<li class="L11319" rel="L11319">alarm.</li>
<li class="L11320" rel="L11320"></li>
<li class="L11321" rel="L11321">His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an</li>
<li class="L11322" rel="L11322">admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded</li>
<li class="L11323" rel="L11323">Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane&#39;s happiness, and his</li>
<li class="L11324" rel="L11324">own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the</li>
<li class="L11325" rel="L11325">consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It</li>
<li class="L11326" rel="L11326">gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in</li>
<li class="L11327" rel="L11327">no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table</li>
<li class="L11328" rel="L11328">could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little</li>
<li class="L11329" rel="L11329">such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to</li>
<li class="L11330" rel="L11330">advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but</li>
<li class="L11331" rel="L11331">she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and</li>
<li class="L11332" rel="L11332">cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother&#39;s ungraciousness,</li>
<li class="L11333" rel="L11333">made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth&#39;s mind;</li>
<li class="L11334" rel="L11334">and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell</li>
<li class="L11335" rel="L11335">him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the</li>
<li class="L11336" rel="L11336">family.</li>
<li class="L11337" rel="L11337"></li>
<li class="L11338" rel="L11338">She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of</li>
<li class="L11339" rel="L11339">bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away</li>
<li class="L11340" rel="L11340">without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than</li>
<li class="L11341" rel="L11341">the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious</li>
<li class="L11342" rel="L11342">and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the</li>
<li class="L11343" rel="L11343">gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her</li>
<li class="L11344" rel="L11344">uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all</li>
<li class="L11345" rel="L11345">her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.</li>
<li class="L11346" rel="L11346"></li>
<li class="L11347" rel="L11347">“If he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “I shall give him up for</li>
<li class="L11348" rel="L11348">ever.”</li>
<li class="L11349" rel="L11349"></li>
<li class="L11350" rel="L11350">The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have</li>
<li class="L11351" rel="L11351">answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,</li>
<li class="L11352" rel="L11352">where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,</li>
<li class="L11353" rel="L11353">in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her</li>
<li class="L11354" rel="L11354">which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen&#39;s approaching, one of</li>
<li class="L11355" rel="L11355">the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:</li>
<li class="L11356" rel="L11356"></li>
<li class="L11357" rel="L11357">“The men shan&#39;t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;</li>
<li class="L11358" rel="L11358">do we?”</li>
<li class="L11359" rel="L11359"></li>
<li class="L11360" rel="L11360">Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with</li>
<li class="L11361" rel="L11361">her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough</li>
<li class="L11362" rel="L11362">to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for</li>
<li class="L11363" rel="L11363">being so silly!</li>
<li class="L11364" rel="L11364"></li>
<li class="L11365" rel="L11365">“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to</li>
<li class="L11366" rel="L11366">expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not</li>
<li class="L11367" rel="L11367">protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?</li>
<li class="L11368" rel="L11368">There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!”</li>
<li class="L11369" rel="L11369"></li>
<li class="L11370" rel="L11370">She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup</li>
<li class="L11371" rel="L11371">himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:</li>
<li class="L11372" rel="L11372"></li>
<li class="L11373" rel="L11373">“Is your sister at Pemberley still?”</li>
<li class="L11374" rel="L11374"></li>
<li class="L11375" rel="L11375">“Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.”</li>
<li class="L11376" rel="L11376"></li>
<li class="L11377" rel="L11377">“And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?”</li>
<li class="L11378" rel="L11378"></li>
<li class="L11379" rel="L11379">“Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough,</li>
<li class="L11380" rel="L11380">these three weeks.”</li>
<li class="L11381" rel="L11381"></li>
<li class="L11382" rel="L11382">She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse</li>
<li class="L11383" rel="L11383">with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for</li>
<li class="L11384" rel="L11384">some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady&#39;s whispering</li>
<li class="L11385" rel="L11385">to Elizabeth again, he walked away.</li>
<li class="L11386" rel="L11386"></li>
<li class="L11387" rel="L11387">When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies</li>
<li class="L11388" rel="L11388">all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him,</li>
<li class="L11389" rel="L11389">when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her</li>
<li class="L11390" rel="L11390">mother&#39;s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated</li>
<li class="L11391" rel="L11391">with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.</li>
<li class="L11392" rel="L11392">They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had</li>
<li class="L11393" rel="L11393">nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side</li>
<li class="L11394" rel="L11394">of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.</li>
<li class="L11395" rel="L11395"></li>
<li class="L11396" rel="L11396">Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to</li>
<li class="L11397" rel="L11397">supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the</li>
<li class="L11398" rel="L11398">others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.</li>
<li class="L11399" rel="L11399"></li>
<li class="L11400" rel="L11400">“Well girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “What</li>
<li class="L11401" rel="L11401">say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,</li>
<li class="L11402" rel="L11402">I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The</li>
<li class="L11403" rel="L11403">venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said they never saw so</li>
<li class="L11404" rel="L11404">fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the</li>
<li class="L11405" rel="L11405">Lucases&#39; last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges</li>
<li class="L11406" rel="L11406">were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French</li>
<li class="L11407" rel="L11407">cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater</li>
<li class="L11408" rel="L11408">beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And</li>
<li class="L11409" rel="L11409">what do you think she said besides? &#39;Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her</li>
<li class="L11410" rel="L11410">at Netherfield at last.&#39; She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good</li>
<li class="L11411" rel="L11411">a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,</li>
<li class="L11412" rel="L11412">and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.”</li>
<li class="L11413" rel="L11413"></li>
<li class="L11414" rel="L11414">Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of</li>
<li class="L11415" rel="L11415">Bingley&#39;s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at</li>
<li class="L11416" rel="L11416">last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy</li>
<li class="L11417" rel="L11417">humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at</li>
<li class="L11418" rel="L11418">not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.</li>
<li class="L11419" rel="L11419"></li>
<li class="L11420" rel="L11420">“It has been a very agreeable day,” said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. “The</li>
<li class="L11421" rel="L11421">party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we</li>
<li class="L11422" rel="L11422">may often meet again.”</li>
<li class="L11423" rel="L11423"></li>
<li class="L11424" rel="L11424">Elizabeth smiled.</li>
<li class="L11425" rel="L11425"></li>
<li class="L11426" rel="L11426">“Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me.</li>
<li class="L11427" rel="L11427">I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an</li>
<li class="L11428" rel="L11428">agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am</li>
<li class="L11429" rel="L11429">perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had</li>
<li class="L11430" rel="L11430">any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed</li>
<li class="L11431" rel="L11431">with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally</li>
<li class="L11432" rel="L11432">pleasing, than any other man.”</li>
<li class="L11433" rel="L11433"></li>
<li class="L11434" rel="L11434">“You are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me smile, and</li>
<li class="L11435" rel="L11435">are provoking me to it every moment.”</li>
<li class="L11436" rel="L11436"></li>
<li class="L11437" rel="L11437">“How hard it is in some cases to be believed!”</li>
<li class="L11438" rel="L11438"></li>
<li class="L11439" rel="L11439">“And how impossible in others!”</li>
<li class="L11440" rel="L11440"></li>
<li class="L11441" rel="L11441">“But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I</li>
<li class="L11442" rel="L11442">acknowledge?”</li>
<li class="L11443" rel="L11443"></li>
<li class="L11444" rel="L11444">“That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to</li>
<li class="L11445" rel="L11445">instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive</li>
<li class="L11446" rel="L11446">me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.”</li>
<li class="L11447" rel="L11447"></li>
<li class="L11448" rel="L11448"></li>
<li class="L11449" rel="L11449"></li>

<li class="L11452" rel="L11452"></li>
<li class="L11453" rel="L11453">A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His</li>
<li class="L11454" rel="L11454">friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in</li>
<li class="L11455" rel="L11455">ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably</li>
<li class="L11456" rel="L11456">good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many</li>
<li class="L11457" rel="L11457">expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.</li>
<li class="L11458" rel="L11458"></li>
<li class="L11459" rel="L11459">“Next time you call,” said she, “I hope we shall be more lucky.”</li>
<li class="L11460" rel="L11460"></li>
<li class="L11461" rel="L11461">He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would</li>
<li class="L11462" rel="L11462">give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.</li>
<li class="L11463" rel="L11463"></li>
<li class="L11464" rel="L11464">“Can you come to-morrow?”</li>
<li class="L11465" rel="L11465"></li>
<li class="L11466" rel="L11466">Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was</li>
<li class="L11467" rel="L11467">accepted with alacrity.</li>
<li class="L11468" rel="L11468"></li>
<li class="L11469" rel="L11469">He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them</li>
<li class="L11470" rel="L11470">dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter&#39;s room, in her dressing</li>
<li class="L11471" rel="L11471">gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:</li>
<li class="L11472" rel="L11472"></li>
<li class="L11473" rel="L11473">“My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is</li>
<li class="L11474" rel="L11474">come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss</li>
<li class="L11475" rel="L11475">Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss</li>
<li class="L11476" rel="L11476">Lizzy&#39;s hair.”</li>
<li class="L11477" rel="L11477"></li>
<li class="L11478" rel="L11478">“We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say Kitty is</li>
<li class="L11479" rel="L11479">forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.”</li>
<li class="L11480" rel="L11480"></li>
<li class="L11481" rel="L11481">“Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick!</li>
<li class="L11482" rel="L11482">Where is your sash, my dear?”</li>
<li class="L11483" rel="L11483"></li>
<li class="L11484" rel="L11484">But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down</li>
<li class="L11485" rel="L11485">without one of her sisters.</li>
<li class="L11486" rel="L11486"></li>
<li class="L11487" rel="L11487">The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the</li>
<li class="L11488" rel="L11488">evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his</li>
<li class="L11489" rel="L11489">custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of</li>
<li class="L11490" rel="L11490">the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at</li>
<li class="L11491" rel="L11491">Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any</li>
<li class="L11492" rel="L11492">impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last</li>
<li class="L11493" rel="L11493">Kitty did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter mamma? What do</li>
<li class="L11494" rel="L11494">you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?”</li>
<li class="L11495" rel="L11495"></li>
<li class="L11496" rel="L11496">“Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.” She then sat still</li>
<li class="L11497" rel="L11497">five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she</li>
<li class="L11498" rel="L11498">suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, “Come here, my love, I want to</li>
<li class="L11499" rel="L11499">speak to you,” took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look</li>
<li class="L11500" rel="L11500">at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her</li>
<li class="L11501" rel="L11501">entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs.</li>
<li class="L11502" rel="L11502">Bennet half-opened the door and called out:</li>
<li class="L11503" rel="L11503"></li>
<li class="L11504" rel="L11504">“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”</li>
<li class="L11505" rel="L11505"></li>
<li class="L11506" rel="L11506">Elizabeth was forced to go.</li>
<li class="L11507" rel="L11507"></li>
<li class="L11508" rel="L11508">“We may as well leave them by themselves you know;” said her mother, as</li>
<li class="L11509" rel="L11509">soon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in</li>
<li class="L11510" rel="L11510">my dressing-room.”</li>
<li class="L11511" rel="L11511"></li>
<li class="L11512" rel="L11512">Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained</li>
<li class="L11513" rel="L11513">quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned</li>
<li class="L11514" rel="L11514">into the drawing-room.</li>
<li class="L11515" rel="L11515"></li>
<li class="L11516" rel="L11516">Mrs. Bennet&#39;s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every</li>
<li class="L11517" rel="L11517">thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His</li>
<li class="L11518" rel="L11518">ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their</li>
<li class="L11519" rel="L11519">evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the</li>
<li class="L11520" rel="L11520">mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command</li>
<li class="L11521" rel="L11521">of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.</li>
<li class="L11522" rel="L11522"></li>
<li class="L11523" rel="L11523">He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went</li>
<li class="L11524" rel="L11524">away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.</li>
<li class="L11525" rel="L11525">Bennet&#39;s means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.</li>
<li class="L11526" rel="L11526"></li>
<li class="L11527" rel="L11527">After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed</li>
<li class="L11528" rel="L11528">between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in</li>
<li class="L11529" rel="L11529">the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy</li>
<li class="L11530" rel="L11530">returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably</li>
<li class="L11531" rel="L11531">persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman&#39;s</li>
<li class="L11532" rel="L11532">concurrence.</li>
<li class="L11533" rel="L11533"></li>
<li class="L11534" rel="L11534">Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent</li>
<li class="L11535" rel="L11535">the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more</li>
<li class="L11536" rel="L11536">agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption</li>
<li class="L11537" rel="L11537">or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into</li>
<li class="L11538" rel="L11538">silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the</li>
<li class="L11539" rel="L11539">other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;</li>
<li class="L11540" rel="L11540">and in the evening Mrs. Bennet&#39;s invention was again at work to get</li>
<li class="L11541" rel="L11541">every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter</li>
<li class="L11542" rel="L11542">to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;</li>
<li class="L11543" rel="L11543">for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be</li>
<li class="L11544" rel="L11544">wanted to counteract her mother&#39;s schemes.</li>
<li class="L11545" rel="L11545"></li>
<li class="L11546" rel="L11546">But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she</li>
<li class="L11547" rel="L11547">saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother</li>
<li class="L11548" rel="L11548">had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her</li>
<li class="L11549" rel="L11549">sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in</li>
<li class="L11550" rel="L11550">earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of</li>
<li class="L11551" rel="L11551">both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would</li>
<li class="L11552" rel="L11552">have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she</li>
<li class="L11553" rel="L11553">thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and</li>
<li class="L11554" rel="L11554">Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as</li>
<li class="L11555" rel="L11555">well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few</li>
<li class="L11556" rel="L11556">words to her sister, ran out of the room.</li>
<li class="L11557" rel="L11557"></li>
<li class="L11558" rel="L11558">Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give</li>
<li class="L11559" rel="L11559">pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest</li>
<li class="L11560" rel="L11560">emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.</li>
<li class="L11561" rel="L11561"></li>
<li class="L11562" rel="L11562">“&#39;Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh!</li>
<li class="L11563" rel="L11563">why is not everybody as happy?”</li>
<li class="L11564" rel="L11564"></li>
<li class="L11565" rel="L11565">Elizabeth&#39;s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth,</li>
<li class="L11566" rel="L11566">a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of</li>
<li class="L11567" rel="L11567">kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not</li>
<li class="L11568" rel="L11568">allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be</li>
<li class="L11569" rel="L11569">said for the present.</li>
<li class="L11570" rel="L11570"></li>
<li class="L11571" rel="L11571">“I must go instantly to my mother;” she cried. “I would not on any</li>
<li class="L11572" rel="L11572">account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it</li>
<li class="L11573" rel="L11573">from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to</li>
<li class="L11574" rel="L11574">know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear</li>
<li class="L11575" rel="L11575">family! how shall I bear so much happiness!”</li>
<li class="L11576" rel="L11576"></li>
<li class="L11577" rel="L11577">She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the</li>
<li class="L11578" rel="L11578">card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.</li>
<li class="L11579" rel="L11579"></li>
<li class="L11580" rel="L11580">Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease</li>
<li class="L11581" rel="L11581">with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many</li>
<li class="L11582" rel="L11582">previous months of suspense and vexation.</li>
<li class="L11583" rel="L11583"></li>
<li class="L11584" rel="L11584">“And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend&#39;s anxious</li>
<li class="L11585" rel="L11585">circumspection! of all his sister&#39;s falsehood and contrivance! the</li>
<li class="L11586" rel="L11586">happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!”</li>
<li class="L11587" rel="L11587"></li>
<li class="L11588" rel="L11588">In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her</li>
<li class="L11589" rel="L11589">father had been short and to the purpose.</li>
<li class="L11590" rel="L11590"></li>
<li class="L11591" rel="L11591">“Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.</li>
<li class="L11592" rel="L11592"></li>
<li class="L11593" rel="L11593">“With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”</li>
<li class="L11594" rel="L11594"></li>
<li class="L11595" rel="L11595">He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes</li>
<li class="L11596" rel="L11596">and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed</li>
<li class="L11597" rel="L11597">her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with</li>
<li class="L11598" rel="L11598">great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen</li>
<li class="L11599" rel="L11599">to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane&#39;s perfections;</li>
<li class="L11600" rel="L11600">and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his</li>
<li class="L11601" rel="L11601">expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for</li>
<li class="L11602" rel="L11602">basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of</li>
<li class="L11603" rel="L11603">Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and</li>
<li class="L11604" rel="L11604">himself.</li>
<li class="L11605" rel="L11605"></li>
<li class="L11606" rel="L11606">It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of</li>
<li class="L11607" rel="L11607">Miss Bennet&#39;s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as</li>
<li class="L11608" rel="L11608">made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped</li>
<li class="L11609" rel="L11609">her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or</li>
<li class="L11610" rel="L11610">speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,</li>
<li class="L11611" rel="L11611">though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when</li>
<li class="L11612" rel="L11612">Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed</li>
<li class="L11613" rel="L11613">how really happy he was.</li>
<li class="L11614" rel="L11614"></li>
<li class="L11615" rel="L11615">Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their</li>
<li class="L11616" rel="L11616">visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he</li>
<li class="L11617" rel="L11617">turned to his daughter, and said:</li>
<li class="L11618" rel="L11618"></li>
<li class="L11619" rel="L11619">“Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.”</li>
<li class="L11620" rel="L11620"></li>
<li class="L11621" rel="L11621">Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his</li>
<li class="L11622" rel="L11622">goodness.</li>
<li class="L11623" rel="L11623"></li>
<li class="L11624" rel="L11624">“You are a good girl;” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in</li>
<li class="L11625" rel="L11625">thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your</li>
<li class="L11626" rel="L11626">doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are</li>
<li class="L11627" rel="L11627">each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so</li>
<li class="L11628" rel="L11628">easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will</li>
<li class="L11629" rel="L11629">always exceed your income.”</li>
<li class="L11630" rel="L11630"></li>
<li class="L11631" rel="L11631">“I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be</li>
<li class="L11632" rel="L11632">unpardonable in me.”</li>
<li class="L11633" rel="L11633"></li>
<li class="L11634" rel="L11634">“Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you</li>
<li class="L11635" rel="L11635">talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely</li>
<li class="L11636" rel="L11636">more.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so</li>
<li class="L11637" rel="L11637">happy! I am sure I shan&#39;t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it</li>
<li class="L11638" rel="L11638">would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not</li>
<li class="L11639" rel="L11639">be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when</li>
<li class="L11640" rel="L11640">he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was</li>
<li class="L11641" rel="L11641">that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that</li>
<li class="L11642" rel="L11642">ever was seen!”</li>
<li class="L11643" rel="L11643"></li>
<li class="L11644" rel="L11644">Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her</li>
<li class="L11645" rel="L11645">favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger</li>
<li class="L11646" rel="L11646">sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness</li>
<li class="L11647" rel="L11647">which she might in future be able to dispense.</li>
<li class="L11648" rel="L11648"></li>
<li class="L11649" rel="L11649">Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty</li>
<li class="L11650" rel="L11650">begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.</li>
<li class="L11651" rel="L11651"></li>
<li class="L11652" rel="L11652">Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;</li>
<li class="L11653" rel="L11653">coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after</li>
<li class="L11654" rel="L11654">supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough</li>
<li class="L11655" rel="L11655">detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself</li>
<li class="L11656" rel="L11656">obliged to accept.</li>
<li class="L11657" rel="L11657"></li>
<li class="L11658" rel="L11658">Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for</li>
<li class="L11659" rel="L11659">while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else;</li>
<li class="L11660" rel="L11660">but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours</li>
<li class="L11661" rel="L11661">of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he</li>
<li class="L11662" rel="L11662">always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of</li>
<li class="L11663" rel="L11663">her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of</li>
<li class="L11664" rel="L11664">relief.</li>
<li class="L11665" rel="L11665"></li>
<li class="L11666" rel="L11666">“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he</li>
<li class="L11667" rel="L11667">was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed</li>
<li class="L11668" rel="L11668">it possible.”</li>
<li class="L11669" rel="L11669"></li>
<li class="L11670" rel="L11670">“I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But how did he account for</li>
<li class="L11671" rel="L11671">it?”</li>
<li class="L11672" rel="L11672"></li>
<li class="L11673" rel="L11673">“It must have been his sister&#39;s doing. They were certainly no friends to</li>
<li class="L11674" rel="L11674">his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have</li>
<li class="L11675" rel="L11675">chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,</li>
<li class="L11676" rel="L11676">as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will</li>
<li class="L11677" rel="L11677">learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we</li>
<li class="L11678" rel="L11678">can never be what we once were to each other.”</li>
<li class="L11679" rel="L11679"></li>
<li class="L11680" rel="L11680">“That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I ever</li>
<li class="L11681" rel="L11681">heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again</li>
<li class="L11682" rel="L11682">the dupe of Miss Bingley&#39;s pretended regard.”</li>
<li class="L11683" rel="L11683"></li>
<li class="L11684" rel="L11684">“Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,</li>
<li class="L11685" rel="L11685">he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being</li>
<li class="L11686" rel="L11686">indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!”</li>
<li class="L11687" rel="L11687"></li>
<li class="L11688" rel="L11688">“He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his</li>
<li class="L11689" rel="L11689">modesty.”</li>
<li class="L11690" rel="L11690"></li>
<li class="L11691" rel="L11691">This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and</li>
<li class="L11692" rel="L11692">the little value he put on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased</li>
<li class="L11693" rel="L11693">to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for,</li>
<li class="L11694" rel="L11694">though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she</li>
<li class="L11695" rel="L11695">knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.</li>
<li class="L11696" rel="L11696"></li>
<li class="L11697" rel="L11697">“I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried</li>
<li class="L11698" rel="L11698">Jane. “Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed</li>
<li class="L11699" rel="L11699">above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but</li>
<li class="L11700" rel="L11700">such another man for you!”</li>
<li class="L11701" rel="L11701"></li>
<li class="L11702" rel="L11702">“If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as</li>
<li class="L11703" rel="L11703">you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your</li>
<li class="L11704" rel="L11704">happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very</li>
<li class="L11705" rel="L11705">good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”</li>
<li class="L11706" rel="L11706"></li>
<li class="L11707" rel="L11707">The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a</li>
<li class="L11708" rel="L11708">secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips,</li>
<li class="L11709" rel="L11709">and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her</li>
<li class="L11710" rel="L11710">neighbours in Meryton.</li>
<li class="L11711" rel="L11711"></li>
<li class="L11712" rel="L11712">The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the</li>
<li class="L11713" rel="L11713">world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,</li>
<li class="L11714" rel="L11714">they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.</li>
<li class="L11715" rel="L11715"></li>
<li class="L11716" rel="L11716"></li>
<li class="L11717" rel="L11717"></li>
<li class="L11718" rel="L11718">Chapter 56</li>
<li class="L11719" rel="L11719"></li>
<li class="L11720" rel="L11720"></li>
<li class="L11721" rel="L11721">One morning, about a week after Bingley&#39;s engagement with Jane had been</li>
<li class="L11722" rel="L11722">formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the</li>
<li class="L11723" rel="L11723">dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the</li>
<li class="L11724" rel="L11724">sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up</li>
<li class="L11725" rel="L11725">the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the</li>
<li class="L11726" rel="L11726">equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses</li>
<li class="L11727" rel="L11727">were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who</li>
<li class="L11728" rel="L11728">preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that</li>
<li class="L11729" rel="L11729">somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid</li>
<li class="L11730" rel="L11730">the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the</li>
<li class="L11731" rel="L11731">shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three</li>
<li class="L11732" rel="L11732">continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown</li>
<li class="L11733" rel="L11733">open and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.</li>
<li class="L11734" rel="L11734"></li>
<li class="L11735" rel="L11735">They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their</li>
<li class="L11736" rel="L11736">astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.</li>
<li class="L11737" rel="L11737">Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even</li>
<li class="L11738" rel="L11738">inferior to what Elizabeth felt.</li>
<li class="L11739" rel="L11739"></li>
<li class="L11740" rel="L11740">She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no</li>
<li class="L11741" rel="L11741">other reply to Elizabeth&#39;s salutation than a slight inclination of the</li>
<li class="L11742" rel="L11742">head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her</li>
<li class="L11743" rel="L11743">name to her mother on her ladyship&#39;s entrance, though no request of</li>
<li class="L11744" rel="L11744">introduction had been made.</li>
<li class="L11745" rel="L11745"></li>
<li class="L11746" rel="L11746">Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such</li>
<li class="L11747" rel="L11747">high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting</li>
<li class="L11748" rel="L11748">for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,</li>
<li class="L11749" rel="L11749"></li>
<li class="L11750" rel="L11750">“I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your</li>
<li class="L11751" rel="L11751">mother.”</li>
<li class="L11752" rel="L11752"></li>
<li class="L11753" rel="L11753">Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.</li>
<li class="L11754" rel="L11754"></li>
<li class="L11755" rel="L11755">“And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.”</li>
<li class="L11756" rel="L11756"></li>
<li class="L11757" rel="L11757">“Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine.</li>
<li class="L11758" rel="L11758">“She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,</li>
<li class="L11759" rel="L11759">and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man</li>
<li class="L11760" rel="L11760">who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.”</li>
<li class="L11761" rel="L11761"></li>
<li class="L11762" rel="L11762">“You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine after a short</li>
<li class="L11763" rel="L11763">silence.</li>
<li class="L11764" rel="L11764"></li>
<li class="L11765" rel="L11765">“It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I</li>
<li class="L11766" rel="L11766">assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas&#39;s.”</li>
<li class="L11767" rel="L11767"></li>
<li class="L11768" rel="L11768">“This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in</li>
<li class="L11769" rel="L11769">summer; the windows are full west.”</li>
<li class="L11770" rel="L11770"></li>
<li class="L11771" rel="L11771">Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then</li>
<li class="L11772" rel="L11772">added:</li>
<li class="L11773" rel="L11773"></li>
<li class="L11774" rel="L11774">“May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and</li>
<li class="L11775" rel="L11775">Mrs. Collins well.”</li>
<li class="L11776" rel="L11776"></li>
<li class="L11777" rel="L11777">“Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.”</li>
<li class="L11778" rel="L11778"></li>
<li class="L11779" rel="L11779">Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from</li>
<li class="L11780" rel="L11780">Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no</li>
<li class="L11781" rel="L11781">letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.</li>
<li class="L11782" rel="L11782"></li>
<li class="L11783" rel="L11783">Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some</li>
<li class="L11784" rel="L11784">refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,</li>
<li class="L11785" rel="L11785">declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,</li>
<li class="L11786" rel="L11786"></li>
<li class="L11787" rel="L11787">“Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness</li>
<li class="L11788" rel="L11788">on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you</li>
<li class="L11789" rel="L11789">will favour me with your company.”</li>
<li class="L11790" rel="L11790"></li>
<li class="L11791" rel="L11791">“Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her ladyship about the</li>
<li class="L11792" rel="L11792">different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”</li>
<li class="L11793" rel="L11793"></li>
<li class="L11794" rel="L11794">Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,</li>
<li class="L11795" rel="L11795">attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the</li>
<li class="L11796" rel="L11796">hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and</li>
<li class="L11797" rel="L11797">drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent</li>
<li class="L11798" rel="L11798">looking rooms, walked on.</li>
<li class="L11799" rel="L11799"></li>
<li class="L11800" rel="L11800">Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her</li>
<li class="L11801" rel="L11801">waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk</li>
<li class="L11802" rel="L11802">that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for</li>
<li class="L11803" rel="L11803">conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and</li>
<li class="L11804" rel="L11804">disagreeable.</li>
<li class="L11805" rel="L11805"></li>
<li class="L11806" rel="L11806">“How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in</li>
<li class="L11807" rel="L11807">her face.</li>
<li class="L11808" rel="L11808"></li>
<li class="L11809" rel="L11809">As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following</li>
<li class="L11810" rel="L11810">manner:--</li>
<li class="L11811" rel="L11811"></li>
<li class="L11812" rel="L11812">“You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my</li>
<li class="L11813" rel="L11813">journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I</li>
<li class="L11814" rel="L11814">come.”</li>
<li class="L11815" rel="L11815"></li>
<li class="L11816" rel="L11816">Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.</li>
<li class="L11817" rel="L11817"></li>
<li class="L11818" rel="L11818">“Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account</li>
<li class="L11819" rel="L11819">for the honour of seeing you here.”</li>
<li class="L11820" rel="L11820"></li>
<li class="L11821" rel="L11821">“Miss Bennet,” replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought to</li>
<li class="L11822" rel="L11822">know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may</li>
<li class="L11823" rel="L11823">choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been</li>
<li class="L11824" rel="L11824">celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such</li>
<li class="L11825" rel="L11825">moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most</li>
<li class="L11826" rel="L11826">alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your</li>
<li class="L11827" rel="L11827">sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that</li>
<li class="L11828" rel="L11828">you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon</li>
<li class="L11829" rel="L11829">afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I</li>
<li class="L11830" rel="L11830">_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him</li>
<li class="L11831" rel="L11831">so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved</li>
<li class="L11832" rel="L11832">on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to</li>
<li class="L11833" rel="L11833">you.”</li>
<li class="L11834" rel="L11834"></li>
<li class="L11835" rel="L11835">“If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring</li>
<li class="L11836" rel="L11836">with astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of coming</li>
<li class="L11837" rel="L11837">so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?”</li>
<li class="L11838" rel="L11838"></li>
<li class="L11839" rel="L11839">“At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.”</li>
<li class="L11840" rel="L11840"></li>
<li class="L11841" rel="L11841">“Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Elizabeth</li>
<li class="L11842" rel="L11842">coolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report</li>
<li class="L11843" rel="L11843">is in existence.”</li>
<li class="L11844" rel="L11844"></li>
<li class="L11845" rel="L11845">“If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been</li>
<li class="L11846" rel="L11846">industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a</li>
<li class="L11847" rel="L11847">report is spread abroad?”</li>
<li class="L11848" rel="L11848"></li>
<li class="L11849" rel="L11849">“I never heard that it was.”</li>
<li class="L11850" rel="L11850"></li>
<li class="L11851" rel="L11851">“And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?”</li>
<li class="L11852" rel="L11852"></li>
<li class="L11853" rel="L11853">“I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may</li>
<li class="L11854" rel="L11854">ask questions which I shall not choose to answer.”</li>
<li class="L11855" rel="L11855"></li>
<li class="L11856" rel="L11856">“This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has</li>
<li class="L11857" rel="L11857">he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”</li>
<li class="L11858" rel="L11858"></li>
<li class="L11859" rel="L11859">“Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”</li>
<li class="L11860" rel="L11860"></li>
<li class="L11861" rel="L11861">“It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his</li>
<li class="L11862" rel="L11862">reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,</li>
<li class="L11863" rel="L11863">have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You</li>
<li class="L11864" rel="L11864">may have drawn him in.”</li>
<li class="L11865" rel="L11865"></li>
<li class="L11866" rel="L11866">“If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”</li>
<li class="L11867" rel="L11867"></li>
<li class="L11868" rel="L11868">“Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such</li>
<li class="L11869" rel="L11869">language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,</li>
<li class="L11870" rel="L11870">and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”</li>
<li class="L11871" rel="L11871"></li>
<li class="L11872" rel="L11872">“But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this,</li>
<li class="L11873" rel="L11873">ever induce me to be explicit.”</li>
<li class="L11874" rel="L11874"></li>
<li class="L11875" rel="L11875">“Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the</li>
<li class="L11876" rel="L11876">presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is</li>
<li class="L11877" rel="L11877">engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?”</li>
<li class="L11878" rel="L11878"></li>
<li class="L11879" rel="L11879">“Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will</li>
<li class="L11880" rel="L11880">make an offer to me.”</li>
<li class="L11881" rel="L11881"></li>
<li class="L11882" rel="L11882">Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:</li>
<li class="L11883" rel="L11883"></li>
<li class="L11884" rel="L11884">“The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,</li>
<li class="L11885" rel="L11885">they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of</li>
<li class="L11886" rel="L11886">_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned</li>
<li class="L11887" rel="L11887">the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would</li>
<li class="L11888" rel="L11888">be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of</li>
<li class="L11889" rel="L11889">inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to</li>
<li class="L11890" rel="L11890">the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his</li>
<li class="L11891" rel="L11891">tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of</li>
<li class="L11892" rel="L11892">propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest</li>
<li class="L11893" rel="L11893">hours he was destined for his cousin?”</li>
<li class="L11894" rel="L11894"></li>
<li class="L11895" rel="L11895">“Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is</li>
<li class="L11896" rel="L11896">no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not</li>
<li class="L11897" rel="L11897">be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to</li>
<li class="L11898" rel="L11898">marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the</li>
<li class="L11899" rel="L11899">marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither</li>
<li class="L11900" rel="L11900">by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make</li>
<li class="L11901" rel="L11901">another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”</li>
<li class="L11902" rel="L11902"></li>
<li class="L11903" rel="L11903">“Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes,</li>
<li class="L11904" rel="L11904">Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or</li>
<li class="L11905" rel="L11905">friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will</li>
<li class="L11906" rel="L11906">be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.</li>
<li class="L11907" rel="L11907">Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned</li>
<li class="L11908" rel="L11908">by any of us.”</li>
<li class="L11909" rel="L11909"></li>
<li class="L11910" rel="L11910">“These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth. “But the wife of Mr.</li>
<li class="L11911" rel="L11911">Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily</li>
<li class="L11912" rel="L11912">attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause</li>
<li class="L11913" rel="L11913">to repine.”</li>
<li class="L11914" rel="L11914"></li>
<li class="L11915" rel="L11915">“Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude</li>
<li class="L11916" rel="L11916">for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that</li>
<li class="L11917" rel="L11917">score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came</li>
<li class="L11918" rel="L11918">here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will</li>
<li class="L11919" rel="L11919">I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person&#39;s</li>
<li class="L11920" rel="L11920">whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”</li>
<li class="L11921" rel="L11921"></li>
<li class="L11922" rel="L11922">“_That_ will make your ladyship&#39;s situation at present more pitiable;</li>
<li class="L11923" rel="L11923">but it will have no effect on me.”</li>
<li class="L11924" rel="L11924"></li>
<li class="L11925" rel="L11925">“I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my</li>
<li class="L11926" rel="L11926">nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal</li>
<li class="L11927" rel="L11927">side, from the same noble line; and, on the father&#39;s, from respectable,</li>
<li class="L11928" rel="L11928">honourable, and ancient--though untitled--families. Their fortune on</li>
<li class="L11929" rel="L11929">both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of</li>
<li class="L11930" rel="L11930">every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?</li>
<li class="L11931" rel="L11931">The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections,</li>
<li class="L11932" rel="L11932">or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you</li>
<li class="L11933" rel="L11933">were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in</li>
<li class="L11934" rel="L11934">which you have been brought up.”</li>
<li class="L11935" rel="L11935"></li>
<li class="L11936" rel="L11936">“In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that</li>
<li class="L11937" rel="L11937">sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman&#39;s daughter; so far we are</li>
<li class="L11938" rel="L11938">equal.”</li>
<li class="L11939" rel="L11939"></li>
<li class="L11940" rel="L11940">“True. You _are_ a gentleman&#39;s daughter. But who was your mother?</li>
<li class="L11941" rel="L11941">Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their</li>
<li class="L11942" rel="L11942">condition.”</li>
<li class="L11943" rel="L11943"></li>
<li class="L11944" rel="L11944">“Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your nephew does</li>
<li class="L11945" rel="L11945">not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.”</li>
<li class="L11946" rel="L11946"></li>
<li class="L11947" rel="L11947">“Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?”</li>
<li class="L11948" rel="L11948"></li>
<li class="L11949" rel="L11949">Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady</li>
<li class="L11950" rel="L11950">Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a</li>
<li class="L11951" rel="L11951">moment&#39;s deliberation:</li>
<li class="L11952" rel="L11952"></li>
<li class="L11953" rel="L11953">“I am not.”</li>
<li class="L11954" rel="L11954"></li>
<li class="L11955" rel="L11955">Lady Catherine seemed pleased.</li>
<li class="L11956" rel="L11956"></li>
<li class="L11957" rel="L11957">“And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?”</li>
<li class="L11958" rel="L11958"></li>
<li class="L11959" rel="L11959">“I will make no promise of the kind.”</li>
<li class="L11960" rel="L11960"></li>
<li class="L11961" rel="L11961">“Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more</li>
<li class="L11962" rel="L11962">reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that</li>
<li class="L11963" rel="L11963">I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the</li>
<li class="L11964" rel="L11964">assurance I require.”</li>
<li class="L11965" rel="L11965"></li>
<li class="L11966" rel="L11966">“And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into</li>
<li class="L11967" rel="L11967">anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry</li>
<li class="L11968" rel="L11968">your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their</li>
<li class="L11969" rel="L11969">marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would</li>
<li class="L11970" rel="L11970">my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?</li>
<li class="L11971" rel="L11971">Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have</li>
<li class="L11972" rel="L11972">supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the</li>
<li class="L11973" rel="L11973">application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if</li>
<li class="L11974" rel="L11974">you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your</li>
<li class="L11975" rel="L11975">nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell;</li>
<li class="L11976" rel="L11976">but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,</li>
<li class="L11977" rel="L11977">therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.”</li>
<li class="L11978" rel="L11978"></li>
<li class="L11979" rel="L11979">“Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the</li>
<li class="L11980" rel="L11980">objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am</li>
<li class="L11981" rel="L11981">no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister&#39;s infamous</li>
<li class="L11982" rel="L11982">elopement. I know it all; that the young man&#39;s marrying her was a</li>
<li class="L11983" rel="L11983">patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is</li>
<li class="L11984" rel="L11984">such a girl to be my nephew&#39;s sister? Is her husband, is the son of his</li>
<li class="L11985" rel="L11985">late father&#39;s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what are</li>
<li class="L11986" rel="L11986">you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”</li>
<li class="L11987" rel="L11987"></li>
<li class="L11988" rel="L11988">“You can now have nothing further to say,” she resentfully answered.</li>
<li class="L11989" rel="L11989">“You have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to</li>
<li class="L11990" rel="L11990">the house.”</li>
<li class="L11991" rel="L11991"></li>
<li class="L11992" rel="L11992">And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned</li>
<li class="L11993" rel="L11993">back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.</li>
<li class="L11994" rel="L11994"></li>
<li class="L11995" rel="L11995">“You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!</li>
<li class="L11996" rel="L11996">Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you</li>
<li class="L11997" rel="L11997">must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”</li>
<li class="L11998" rel="L11998"></li>
<li class="L11999" rel="L11999">“Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.”</li>
<li class="L12000" rel="L12000"></li>
<li class="L12001" rel="L12001">“You are then resolved to have him?”</li>
<li class="L12002" rel="L12002"></li>
<li class="L12003" rel="L12003">“I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,</li>
<li class="L12004" rel="L12004">which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without</li>
<li class="L12005" rel="L12005">reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”</li>
<li class="L12006" rel="L12006"></li>
<li class="L12007" rel="L12007">“It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the</li>
<li class="L12008" rel="L12008">claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in</li>
<li class="L12009" rel="L12009">the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.”</li>
<li class="L12010" rel="L12010"></li>
<li class="L12011" rel="L12011">“Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth, “have any</li>
<li class="L12012" rel="L12012">possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either</li>
<li class="L12013" rel="L12013">would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the</li>
<li class="L12014" rel="L12014">resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former</li>
<li class="L12015" rel="L12015">_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment&#39;s</li>
<li class="L12016" rel="L12016">concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in</li>
<li class="L12017" rel="L12017">the scorn.”</li>
<li class="L12018" rel="L12018"></li>
<li class="L12019" rel="L12019">“And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well.</li>
<li class="L12020" rel="L12020">I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your</li>
<li class="L12021" rel="L12021">ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you</li>
<li class="L12022" rel="L12022">reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point.”</li>
<li class="L12023" rel="L12023"></li>
<li class="L12024" rel="L12024">In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of</li>
<li class="L12025" rel="L12025">the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, “I take no leave</li>
<li class="L12026" rel="L12026">of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve</li>
<li class="L12027" rel="L12027">no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.”</li>
<li class="L12028" rel="L12028"></li>
<li class="L12029" rel="L12029">Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her</li>
<li class="L12030" rel="L12030">ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She</li>
<li class="L12031" rel="L12031">heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother</li>
<li class="L12032" rel="L12032">impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady</li>
<li class="L12033" rel="L12033">Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.</li>
<li class="L12034" rel="L12034"></li>
<li class="L12035" rel="L12035">“She did not choose it,” said her daughter, “she would go.”</li>
<li class="L12036" rel="L12036"></li>
<li class="L12037" rel="L12037">“She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously</li>
<li class="L12038" rel="L12038">civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were</li>
<li class="L12039" rel="L12039">well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through</li>
<li class="L12040" rel="L12040">Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had</li>
<li class="L12041" rel="L12041">nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?”</li>
<li class="L12042" rel="L12042"></li>
<li class="L12043" rel="L12043">Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to</li>
<li class="L12044" rel="L12044">acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.</li>
<li class="L12045" rel="L12045"></li>
<li class="L12046" rel="L12046"></li>
<li class="L12047" rel="L12047"></li>
<li class="L12048" rel="L12048">Chapter 57</li>
<li class="L12049" rel="L12049"></li>
<li class="L12050" rel="L12050"></li>
<li class="L12051" rel="L12051">The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw</li>
<li class="L12052" rel="L12052">Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many</li>
<li class="L12053" rel="L12053">hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it</li>
<li class="L12054" rel="L12054">appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,</li>
<li class="L12055" rel="L12055">for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.</li>
<li class="L12056" rel="L12056">Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report</li>
<li class="L12057" rel="L12057">of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;</li>
<li class="L12058" rel="L12058">till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,</li>
<li class="L12059" rel="L12059">and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the</li>
<li class="L12060" rel="L12060">expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply</li>
<li class="L12061" rel="L12061">the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her</li>
<li class="L12062" rel="L12062">sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours</li>
<li class="L12063" rel="L12063">at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the</li>
<li class="L12064" rel="L12064">Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had</li>
<li class="L12065" rel="L12065">only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked</li>
<li class="L12066" rel="L12066">forward to as possible at some future time.</li>
<li class="L12067" rel="L12067"></li>
<li class="L12068" rel="L12068">In revolving Lady Catherine&#39;s expressions, however, she could not help</li>
<li class="L12069" rel="L12069">feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting</li>
<li class="L12070" rel="L12070">in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to</li>
<li class="L12071" rel="L12071">prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate</li>
<li class="L12072" rel="L12072">an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar</li>
<li class="L12073" rel="L12073">representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared</li>
<li class="L12074" rel="L12074">not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his</li>
<li class="L12075" rel="L12075">aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose</li>
<li class="L12076" rel="L12076">that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it</li>
<li class="L12077" rel="L12077">was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,</li>
<li class="L12078" rel="L12078">whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would</li>
<li class="L12079" rel="L12079">address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would</li>
<li class="L12080" rel="L12080">probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak</li>
<li class="L12081" rel="L12081">and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.</li>
<li class="L12082" rel="L12082"></li>
<li class="L12083" rel="L12083">If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often</li>
<li class="L12084" rel="L12084">seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might</li>
<li class="L12085" rel="L12085">settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity</li>
<li class="L12086" rel="L12086">unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady</li>
<li class="L12087" rel="L12087">Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to</li>
<li class="L12088" rel="L12088">Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.</li>
<li class="L12089" rel="L12089"></li>
<li class="L12090" rel="L12090">“If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his</li>
<li class="L12091" rel="L12091">friend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to understand</li>
<li class="L12092" rel="L12092">it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his</li>
<li class="L12093" rel="L12093">constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might</li>
<li class="L12094" rel="L12094">have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him</li>
<li class="L12095" rel="L12095">at all.”</li>
<li class="L12096" rel="L12096"></li>
<li class="L12097" rel="L12097">                          * * * * *</li>
<li class="L12098" rel="L12098"></li>
<li class="L12099" rel="L12099">The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had</li>
<li class="L12100" rel="L12100">been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same</li>
<li class="L12101" rel="L12101">kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet&#39;s curiosity; and</li>
<li class="L12102" rel="L12102">Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.</li>
<li class="L12103" rel="L12103"></li>
<li class="L12104" rel="L12104">The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her</li>
<li class="L12105" rel="L12105">father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.</li>
<li class="L12106" rel="L12106"></li>
<li class="L12107" rel="L12107">“Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you; come into my room.”</li>
<li class="L12108" rel="L12108"></li>
<li class="L12109" rel="L12109">She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to</li>
<li class="L12110" rel="L12110">tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner</li>
<li class="L12111" rel="L12111">connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it</li>
<li class="L12112" rel="L12112">might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the</li>
<li class="L12113" rel="L12113">consequent explanations.</li>
<li class="L12114" rel="L12114"></li>
<li class="L12115" rel="L12115">She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He</li>
<li class="L12116" rel="L12116">then said,</li>
<li class="L12117" rel="L12117"></li>
<li class="L12118" rel="L12118">“I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me</li>
<li class="L12119" rel="L12119">exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its</li>
<li class="L12120" rel="L12120">contents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink</li>
<li class="L12121" rel="L12121">of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.”</li>
<li class="L12122" rel="L12122"></li>
<li class="L12123" rel="L12123">The colour now rushed into Elizabeth&#39;s cheeks in the instantaneous</li>
<li class="L12124" rel="L12124">conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;</li>
<li class="L12125" rel="L12125">and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained</li>
<li class="L12126" rel="L12126">himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to</li>
<li class="L12127" rel="L12127">herself; when her father continued:</li>
<li class="L12128" rel="L12128"></li>
<li class="L12129" rel="L12129">“You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters</li>
<li class="L12130" rel="L12130">as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the</li>
<li class="L12131" rel="L12131">name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.”</li>
<li class="L12132" rel="L12132"></li>
<li class="L12133" rel="L12133">“From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?”</li>
<li class="L12134" rel="L12134"></li>
<li class="L12135" rel="L12135">“Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with</li>
<li class="L12136" rel="L12136">congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of</li>
<li class="L12137" rel="L12137">which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping</li>
<li class="L12138" rel="L12138">Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says</li>
<li class="L12139" rel="L12139">on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows: &#39;Having thus</li>
<li class="L12140" rel="L12140">offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on</li>
<li class="L12141" rel="L12141">this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another;</li>
<li class="L12142" rel="L12142">of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter</li>
<li class="L12143" rel="L12143">Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after</li>
<li class="L12144" rel="L12144">her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may</li>
<li class="L12145" rel="L12145">be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in</li>
<li class="L12146" rel="L12146">this land.&#39;</li>
<li class="L12147" rel="L12147"></li>
<li class="L12148" rel="L12148">“Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? &#39;This young</li>
<li class="L12149" rel="L12149">gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of</li>
<li class="L12150" rel="L12150">mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive</li>
<li class="L12151" rel="L12151">patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin</li>
<li class="L12152" rel="L12152">Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate</li>
<li class="L12153" rel="L12153">closure with this gentleman&#39;s proposals, which, of course, you will be</li>
<li class="L12154" rel="L12154">inclined to take immediate advantage of.&#39;</li>
<li class="L12155" rel="L12155"></li>
<li class="L12156" rel="L12156">“Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out:</li>
<li class="L12157" rel="L12157"></li>
<li class="L12158" rel="L12158">“&#39;My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine</li>
<li class="L12159" rel="L12159">that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with</li>
<li class="L12160" rel="L12160">a friendly eye.&#39;</li>
<li class="L12161" rel="L12161"></li>
<li class="L12162" rel="L12162">“_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_</li>
<li class="L12163" rel="L12163">surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within</li>
<li class="L12164" rel="L12164">the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie</li>
<li class="L12165" rel="L12165">more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any</li>
<li class="L12166" rel="L12166">woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his</li>
<li class="L12167" rel="L12167">life! It is admirable!”</li>
<li class="L12168" rel="L12168"></li>
<li class="L12169" rel="L12169">Elizabeth tried to join in her father&#39;s pleasantry, but could only force</li>
<li class="L12170" rel="L12170">one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so</li>
<li class="L12171" rel="L12171">little agreeable to her.</li>
<li class="L12172" rel="L12172"></li>
<li class="L12173" rel="L12173">“Are you not diverted?”</li>
<li class="L12174" rel="L12174"></li>
<li class="L12175" rel="L12175">“Oh! yes. Pray read on.”</li>
<li class="L12176" rel="L12176"></li>
<li class="L12177" rel="L12177">“&#39;After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last</li>
<li class="L12178" rel="L12178">night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she</li>
<li class="L12179" rel="L12179">felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some</li>
<li class="L12180" rel="L12180">family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her</li>
<li class="L12181" rel="L12181">consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty</li>
<li class="L12182" rel="L12182">to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and</li>
<li class="L12183" rel="L12183">her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run</li>
<li class="L12184" rel="L12184">hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.&#39; Mr.</li>
<li class="L12185" rel="L12185">Collins moreover adds, &#39;I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia&#39;s sad</li>
<li class="L12186" rel="L12186">business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their</li>
<li class="L12187" rel="L12187">living together before the marriage took place should be so generally</li>
<li class="L12188" rel="L12188">known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain</li>
<li class="L12189" rel="L12189">from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young</li>
<li class="L12190" rel="L12190">couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an</li>
<li class="L12191" rel="L12191">encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should</li>
<li class="L12192" rel="L12192">very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them,</li>
<li class="L12193" rel="L12193">as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their</li>
<li class="L12194" rel="L12194">names to be mentioned in your hearing.&#39; That is his notion of Christian</li>
<li class="L12195" rel="L12195">forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte&#39;s</li>
<li class="L12196" rel="L12196">situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you</li>
<li class="L12197" rel="L12197">look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be _missish_,</li>
<li class="L12198" rel="L12198">I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we</li>
<li class="L12199" rel="L12199">live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our</li>
<li class="L12200" rel="L12200">turn?”</li>
<li class="L12201" rel="L12201"></li>
<li class="L12202" rel="L12202">“Oh!” cried Elizabeth, “I am excessively diverted. But it is so</li>
<li class="L12203" rel="L12203">strange!”</li>
<li class="L12204" rel="L12204"></li>
<li class="L12205" rel="L12205">“Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man</li>
<li class="L12206" rel="L12206">it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_</li>
<li class="L12207" rel="L12207">pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate</li>
<li class="L12208" rel="L12208">writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins&#39;s correspondence for any</li>
<li class="L12209" rel="L12209">consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving</li>
<li class="L12210" rel="L12210">him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and</li>
<li class="L12211" rel="L12211">hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine</li>
<li class="L12212" rel="L12212">about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?”</li>
<li class="L12213" rel="L12213"></li>
<li class="L12214" rel="L12214">To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had</li>
<li class="L12215" rel="L12215">been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by</li>
<li class="L12216" rel="L12216">his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her</li>
<li class="L12217" rel="L12217">feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she</li>
<li class="L12218" rel="L12218">would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by</li>
<li class="L12219" rel="L12219">what he said of Mr. Darcy&#39;s indifference, and she could do nothing but</li>
<li class="L12220" rel="L12220">wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of</li>
<li class="L12221" rel="L12221">his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.</li>
<li class="L12222" rel="L12222"></li>
<li class="L12223" rel="L12223"></li>
<li class="L12224" rel="L12224"></li>
<li class="L12225" rel="L12225">Chapter 58</li>
<li class="L12226" rel="L12226"></li>
<li class="L12227" rel="L12227"></li>
<li class="L12228" rel="L12228">Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as</li>
<li class="L12229" rel="L12229">Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy</li>
<li class="L12230" rel="L12230">with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine&#39;s</li>
<li class="L12231" rel="L12231">visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time</li>
<li class="L12232" rel="L12232">to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat</li>
<li class="L12233" rel="L12233">in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed</li>
<li class="L12234" rel="L12234">their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the</li>
<li class="L12235" rel="L12235">habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five</li>
<li class="L12236" rel="L12236">set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others</li>
<li class="L12237" rel="L12237">to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy</li>
<li class="L12238" rel="L12238">were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty</li>
<li class="L12239" rel="L12239">was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a</li>
<li class="L12240" rel="L12240">desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.</li>
<li class="L12241" rel="L12241"></li>
<li class="L12242" rel="L12242">They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon</li>
<li class="L12243" rel="L12243">Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,</li>
<li class="L12244" rel="L12244">when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the</li>
<li class="L12245" rel="L12245">moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was</li>
<li class="L12246" rel="L12246">high, she immediately said:</li>
<li class="L12247" rel="L12247"></li>
<li class="L12248" rel="L12248">“Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving</li>
<li class="L12249" rel="L12249">relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I</li>
<li class="L12250" rel="L12250">can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my</li>
<li class="L12251" rel="L12251">poor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to</li>
<li class="L12252" rel="L12252">acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest</li>
<li class="L12253" rel="L12253">of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.”</li>
<li class="L12254" rel="L12254"></li>
<li class="L12255" rel="L12255">“I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise</li>
<li class="L12256" rel="L12256">and emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in a</li>
<li class="L12257" rel="L12257">mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner</li>
<li class="L12258" rel="L12258">was so little to be trusted.”</li>
<li class="L12259" rel="L12259"></li>
<li class="L12260" rel="L12260">“You must not blame my aunt. Lydia&#39;s thoughtlessness first betrayed to</li>
<li class="L12261" rel="L12261">me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could</li>
<li class="L12262" rel="L12262">not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,</li>
<li class="L12263" rel="L12263">in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced</li>
<li class="L12264" rel="L12264">you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the</li>
<li class="L12265" rel="L12265">sake of discovering them.”</li>
<li class="L12266" rel="L12266"></li>
<li class="L12267" rel="L12267">“If you _will_ thank me,” he replied, “let it be for yourself alone.</li>
<li class="L12268" rel="L12268">That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other</li>
<li class="L12269" rel="L12269">inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your</li>
<li class="L12270" rel="L12270">_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought</li>
<li class="L12271" rel="L12271">only of _you_.”</li>
<li class="L12272" rel="L12272"></li>
<li class="L12273" rel="L12273">Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,</li>
<li class="L12274" rel="L12274">her companion added, “You are too generous to trifle with me. If your</li>
<li class="L12275" rel="L12275">feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_</li>
<li class="L12276" rel="L12276">affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence</li>
<li class="L12277" rel="L12277">me on this subject for ever.”</li>
<li class="L12278" rel="L12278"></li>
<li class="L12279" rel="L12279">Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of</li>
<li class="L12280" rel="L12280">his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not</li>
<li class="L12281" rel="L12281">very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone</li>
<li class="L12282" rel="L12282">so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make</li>
<li class="L12283" rel="L12283">her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The</li>
<li class="L12284" rel="L12284">happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never</li>
<li class="L12285" rel="L12285">felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as</li>
<li class="L12286" rel="L12286">warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth</li>
<li class="L12287" rel="L12287">been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the</li>
<li class="L12288" rel="L12288">expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him;</li>
<li class="L12289" rel="L12289">but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of</li>
<li class="L12290" rel="L12290">feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his</li>
<li class="L12291" rel="L12291">affection every moment more valuable.</li>
<li class="L12292" rel="L12292"></li>
<li class="L12293" rel="L12293">They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to</li>
<li class="L12294" rel="L12294">be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She</li>
<li class="L12295" rel="L12295">soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding</li>
<li class="L12296" rel="L12296">to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through</li>
<li class="L12297" rel="L12297">London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the</li>
<li class="L12298" rel="L12298">substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on</li>
<li class="L12299" rel="L12299">every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship&#39;s apprehension,</li>
<li class="L12300" rel="L12300">peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that</li>
<li class="L12301" rel="L12301">such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise</li>
<li class="L12302" rel="L12302">from her nephew which she had refused to give. But, unluckily for her</li>
<li class="L12303" rel="L12303">ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.</li>
<li class="L12304" rel="L12304"></li>
<li class="L12305" rel="L12305">“It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed myself</li>
<li class="L12306" rel="L12306">to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that,</li>
<li class="L12307" rel="L12307">had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have</li>
<li class="L12308" rel="L12308">acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.”</li>
<li class="L12309" rel="L12309"></li>
<li class="L12310" rel="L12310">Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes, you know enough</li>
<li class="L12311" rel="L12311">of my frankness to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so</li>
<li class="L12312" rel="L12312">abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all</li>
<li class="L12313" rel="L12313">your relations.”</li>
<li class="L12314" rel="L12314"></li>
<li class="L12315" rel="L12315">“What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your</li>
<li class="L12316" rel="L12316">accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my</li>
<li class="L12317" rel="L12317">behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was</li>
<li class="L12318" rel="L12318">unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.”</li>
<li class="L12319" rel="L12319"></li>
<li class="L12320" rel="L12320">“We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that</li>
<li class="L12321" rel="L12321">evening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,</li>
<li class="L12322" rel="L12322">will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved</li>
<li class="L12323" rel="L12323">in civility.”</li>
<li class="L12324" rel="L12324"></li>
<li class="L12325" rel="L12325">“I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I</li>
<li class="L12326" rel="L12326">then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of</li>
<li class="L12327" rel="L12327">it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your</li>
<li class="L12328" rel="L12328">reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: &#39;had you behaved in a</li>
<li class="L12329" rel="L12329">more gentlemanlike manner.&#39; Those were your words. You know not, you can</li>
<li class="L12330" rel="L12330">scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time,</li>
<li class="L12331" rel="L12331">I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”</li>
<li class="L12332" rel="L12332"></li>
<li class="L12333" rel="L12333">“I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an</li>
<li class="L12334" rel="L12334">impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such</li>
<li class="L12335" rel="L12335">a way.”</li>
<li class="L12336" rel="L12336"></li>
<li class="L12337" rel="L12337">“I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper</li>
<li class="L12338" rel="L12338">feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never</li>
<li class="L12339" rel="L12339">forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible</li>
<li class="L12340" rel="L12340">way that would induce you to accept me.”</li>
<li class="L12341" rel="L12341"></li>
<li class="L12342" rel="L12342">“Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at</li>
<li class="L12343" rel="L12343">all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”</li>
<li class="L12344" rel="L12344"></li>
<li class="L12345" rel="L12345">Darcy mentioned his letter. “Did it,” said he, “did it soon make you</li>
<li class="L12346" rel="L12346">think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its</li>
<li class="L12347" rel="L12347">contents?”</li>
<li class="L12348" rel="L12348"></li>
<li class="L12349" rel="L12349">She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her</li>
<li class="L12350" rel="L12350">former prejudices had been removed.</li>
<li class="L12351" rel="L12351"></li>
<li class="L12352" rel="L12352">“I knew,” said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was</li>
<li class="L12353" rel="L12353">necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part</li>
<li class="L12354" rel="L12354">especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the</li>
<li class="L12355" rel="L12355">power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might</li>
<li class="L12356" rel="L12356">justly make you hate me.”</li>
<li class="L12357" rel="L12357"></li>
<li class="L12358" rel="L12358">“The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the</li>
<li class="L12359" rel="L12359">preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my</li>
<li class="L12360" rel="L12360">opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily</li>
<li class="L12361" rel="L12361">changed as that implies.”</li>
<li class="L12362" rel="L12362"></li>
<li class="L12363" rel="L12363">“When I wrote that letter,” replied Darcy, “I believed myself perfectly</li>
<li class="L12364" rel="L12364">calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a</li>
<li class="L12365" rel="L12365">dreadful bitterness of spirit.”</li>
<li class="L12366" rel="L12366"></li>
<li class="L12367" rel="L12367">“The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The</li>
<li class="L12368" rel="L12368">adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings</li>
<li class="L12369" rel="L12369">of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now</li>
<li class="L12370" rel="L12370">so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant</li>
<li class="L12371" rel="L12371">circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some</li>
<li class="L12372" rel="L12372">of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you</li>
<li class="L12373" rel="L12373">pleasure.”</li>
<li class="L12374" rel="L12374"></li>
<li class="L12375" rel="L12375">“I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your</li>
<li class="L12376" rel="L12376">retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment</li>
<li class="L12377" rel="L12377">arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of</li>
<li class="L12378" rel="L12378">innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude</li>
<li class="L12379" rel="L12379">which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish</li>
<li class="L12380" rel="L12380">being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I</li>
<li class="L12381" rel="L12381">was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I</li>
<li class="L12382" rel="L12382">was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.</li>
<li class="L12383" rel="L12383">Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt</li>
<li class="L12384" rel="L12384">by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all</li>
<li class="L12385" rel="L12385">that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught</li>
<li class="L12386" rel="L12386">me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family</li>
<li class="L12387" rel="L12387">circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least</li>
<li class="L12388" rel="L12388">to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I</li>
<li class="L12389" rel="L12389">was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been</li>
<li class="L12390" rel="L12390">but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You</li>
<li class="L12391" rel="L12391">taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you,</li>
<li class="L12392" rel="L12392">I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception.</li>
<li class="L12393" rel="L12393">You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman</li>
<li class="L12394" rel="L12394">worthy of being pleased.”</li>
<li class="L12395" rel="L12395"></li>
<li class="L12396" rel="L12396">“Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”</li>
<li class="L12397" rel="L12397"></li>
<li class="L12398" rel="L12398">“Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be</li>
<li class="L12399" rel="L12399">wishing, expecting my addresses.”</li>
<li class="L12400" rel="L12400"></li>
<li class="L12401" rel="L12401">“My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure</li>
<li class="L12402" rel="L12402">you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me</li>
<li class="L12403" rel="L12403">wrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?”</li>
<li class="L12404" rel="L12404"></li>
<li class="L12405" rel="L12405">“Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take</li>
<li class="L12406" rel="L12406">a proper direction.”</li>
<li class="L12407" rel="L12407"></li>
<li class="L12408" rel="L12408">“I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at</li>
<li class="L12409" rel="L12409">Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?”</li>
<li class="L12410" rel="L12410"></li>
<li class="L12411" rel="L12411">“No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.”</li>
<li class="L12412" rel="L12412"></li>
<li class="L12413" rel="L12413">“Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.</li>
<li class="L12414" rel="L12414">My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I</li>
<li class="L12415" rel="L12415">confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.”</li>
<li class="L12416" rel="L12416"></li>
<li class="L12417" rel="L12417">“My object then,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civility in</li>
<li class="L12418" rel="L12418">my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to</li>
<li class="L12419" rel="L12419">obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you</li>
<li class="L12420" rel="L12420">see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes</li>
<li class="L12421" rel="L12421">introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an</li>
<li class="L12422" rel="L12422">hour after I had seen you.”</li>
<li class="L12423" rel="L12423"></li>
<li class="L12424" rel="L12424">He then told her of Georgiana&#39;s delight in her acquaintance, and of her</li>
<li class="L12425" rel="L12425">disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to</li>
<li class="L12426" rel="L12426">the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of</li>
<li class="L12427" rel="L12427">following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed</li>
<li class="L12428" rel="L12428">before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness</li>
<li class="L12429" rel="L12429">there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must</li>
<li class="L12430" rel="L12430">comprehend.</li>
<li class="L12431" rel="L12431"></li>
<li class="L12432" rel="L12432">She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to</li>
<li class="L12433" rel="L12433">each, to be dwelt on farther.</li>
<li class="L12434" rel="L12434"></li>
<li class="L12435" rel="L12435">After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know</li>
<li class="L12436" rel="L12436">anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that</li>
<li class="L12437" rel="L12437">it was time to be at home.</li>
<li class="L12438" rel="L12438"></li>
<li class="L12439" rel="L12439">“What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!” was a wonder which</li>
<li class="L12440" rel="L12440">introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted with</li>
<li class="L12441" rel="L12441">their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of</li>
<li class="L12442" rel="L12442">it.</li>
<li class="L12443" rel="L12443"></li>
<li class="L12444" rel="L12444">“I must ask whether you were surprised?” said Elizabeth.</li>
<li class="L12445" rel="L12445"></li>
<li class="L12446" rel="L12446">“Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.”</li>
<li class="L12447" rel="L12447"></li>
<li class="L12448" rel="L12448">“That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.” And</li>
<li class="L12449" rel="L12449">though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much</li>
<li class="L12450" rel="L12450">the case.</li>
<li class="L12451" rel="L12451"></li>
<li class="L12452" rel="L12452">“On the evening before my going to London,” said he, “I made a</li>
<li class="L12453" rel="L12453">confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I</li>
<li class="L12454" rel="L12454">told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his</li>
<li class="L12455" rel="L12455">affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had</li>
<li class="L12456" rel="L12456">the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself</li>
<li class="L12457" rel="L12457">mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent</li>
<li class="L12458" rel="L12458">to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was</li>
<li class="L12459" rel="L12459">unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.”</li>
<li class="L12460" rel="L12460"></li>
<li class="L12461" rel="L12461">Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his</li>
<li class="L12462" rel="L12462">friend.</li>
<li class="L12463" rel="L12463"></li>
<li class="L12464" rel="L12464">“Did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you told him</li>
<li class="L12465" rel="L12465">that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?”</li>
<li class="L12466" rel="L12466"></li>
<li class="L12467" rel="L12467">“From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits</li>
<li class="L12468" rel="L12468">which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection.”</li>
<li class="L12469" rel="L12469"></li>
<li class="L12470" rel="L12470">“And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to</li>
<li class="L12471" rel="L12471">him.”</li>
<li class="L12472" rel="L12472"></li>
<li class="L12473" rel="L12473">“It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had</li>
<li class="L12474" rel="L12474">prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but</li>
<li class="L12475" rel="L12475">his reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess</li>
<li class="L12476" rel="L12476">one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not</li>
<li class="L12477" rel="L12477">allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months</li>
<li class="L12478" rel="L12478">last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was</li>
<li class="L12479" rel="L12479">angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained</li>
<li class="L12480" rel="L12480">in any doubt of your sister&#39;s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me</li>
<li class="L12481" rel="L12481">now.”</li>
<li class="L12482" rel="L12482"></li>
<li class="L12483" rel="L12483">Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful</li>
<li class="L12484" rel="L12484">friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked</li>
<li class="L12485" rel="L12485">herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at,</li>
<li class="L12486" rel="L12486">and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness</li>
<li class="L12487" rel="L12487">of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he</li>
<li class="L12488" rel="L12488">continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they</li>
<li class="L12489" rel="L12489">parted.</li>
<li class="L12490" rel="L12490"></li>
<li class="L12491" rel="L12491"></li>
<li class="L12492" rel="L12492"></li>
<li class="L12493" rel="L12493">Chapter 59</li>
<li class="L12494" rel="L12494"></li>
<li class="L12495" rel="L12495"></li>
<li class="L12496" rel="L12496">“My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a question</li>
<li class="L12497" rel="L12497">which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room,</li>
<li class="L12498" rel="L12498">and from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to</li>
<li class="L12499" rel="L12499">say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own</li>
<li class="L12500" rel="L12500">knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything</li>
<li class="L12501" rel="L12501">else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.</li>
<li class="L12502" rel="L12502"></li>
<li class="L12503" rel="L12503">The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The</li>
<li class="L12504" rel="L12504">acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.</li>
<li class="L12505" rel="L12505">Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;</li>
<li class="L12506" rel="L12506">and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy</li>
<li class="L12507" rel="L12507">than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,</li>
<li class="L12508" rel="L12508">there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt</li>
<li class="L12509" rel="L12509">in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no</li>
<li class="L12510" rel="L12510">one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a</li>
<li class="L12511" rel="L12511">dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.</li>
<li class="L12512" rel="L12512"></li>
<li class="L12513" rel="L12513">At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far</li>
<li class="L12514" rel="L12514">from Miss Bennet&#39;s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.</li>
<li class="L12515" rel="L12515"></li>
<li class="L12516" rel="L12516">“You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,</li>
<li class="L12517" rel="L12517">you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.”</li>
<li class="L12518" rel="L12518"></li>
<li class="L12519" rel="L12519">“This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and</li>
<li class="L12520" rel="L12520">I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am</li>
<li class="L12521" rel="L12521">in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are</li>
<li class="L12522" rel="L12522">engaged.”</li>
<li class="L12523" rel="L12523"></li>
<li class="L12524" rel="L12524">Jane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much</li>
<li class="L12525" rel="L12525">you dislike him.”</li>
<li class="L12526" rel="L12526"></li>
<li class="L12527" rel="L12527">“You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I</li>
<li class="L12528" rel="L12528">did not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as</li>
<li class="L12529" rel="L12529">these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever</li>
<li class="L12530" rel="L12530">remember it myself.”</li>
<li class="L12531" rel="L12531"></li>
<li class="L12532" rel="L12532">Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more</li>
<li class="L12533" rel="L12533">seriously assured her of its truth.</li>
<li class="L12534" rel="L12534"></li>
<li class="L12535" rel="L12535">“Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,” cried</li>
<li class="L12536" rel="L12536">Jane. “My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you</li>
<li class="L12537" rel="L12537">certain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be</li>
<li class="L12538" rel="L12538">happy with him?”</li>
<li class="L12539" rel="L12539"></li>
<li class="L12540" rel="L12540">“There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that</li>
<li class="L12541" rel="L12541">we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased,</li>
<li class="L12542" rel="L12542">Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?”</li>
<li class="L12543" rel="L12543"></li>
<li class="L12544" rel="L12544">“Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more</li>
<li class="L12545" rel="L12545">delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you</li>
<li class="L12546" rel="L12546">really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than</li>
<li class="L12547" rel="L12547">marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought</li>
<li class="L12548" rel="L12548">to do?”</li>
<li class="L12549" rel="L12549"></li>
<li class="L12550" rel="L12550">“Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I</li>
<li class="L12551" rel="L12551">tell you all.”</li>
<li class="L12552" rel="L12552"></li>
<li class="L12553" rel="L12553">“What do you mean?”</li>
<li class="L12554" rel="L12554"></li>
<li class="L12555" rel="L12555">“Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am</li>
<li class="L12556" rel="L12556">afraid you will be angry.”</li>
<li class="L12557" rel="L12557"></li>
<li class="L12558" rel="L12558">“My dearest sister, now _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let</li>
<li class="L12559" rel="L12559">me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me</li>
<li class="L12560" rel="L12560">how long you have loved him?”</li>
<li class="L12561" rel="L12561"></li>
<li class="L12562" rel="L12562">“It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.</li>
<li class="L12563" rel="L12563">But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds</li>
<li class="L12564" rel="L12564">at Pemberley.”</li>
<li class="L12565" rel="L12565"></li>
<li class="L12566" rel="L12566">Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the</li>
<li class="L12567" rel="L12567">desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances</li>
<li class="L12568" rel="L12568">of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing</li>
<li class="L12569" rel="L12569">further to wish.</li>
<li class="L12570" rel="L12570"></li>
<li class="L12571" rel="L12571">“Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself.</li>
<li class="L12572" rel="L12572">I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you,</li>
<li class="L12573" rel="L12573">I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley&#39;s friend and your</li>
<li class="L12574" rel="L12574">husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But</li>
<li class="L12575" rel="L12575">Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you</li>
<li class="L12576" rel="L12576">tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know</li>
<li class="L12577" rel="L12577">of it to another, not to you.”</li>
<li class="L12578" rel="L12578"></li>
<li class="L12579" rel="L12579">Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling</li>
<li class="L12580" rel="L12580">to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made</li>
<li class="L12581" rel="L12581">her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer</li>
<li class="L12582" rel="L12582">conceal from her his share in Lydia&#39;s marriage. All was acknowledged,</li>
<li class="L12583" rel="L12583">and half the night spent in conversation.</li>
<li class="L12584" rel="L12584"></li>
<li class="L12585" rel="L12585">                          * * * * *</li>
<li class="L12586" rel="L12586"></li>
<li class="L12587" rel="L12587">“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next</li>
<li class="L12588" rel="L12588">morning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with</li>
<li class="L12589" rel="L12589">our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always</li>
<li class="L12590" rel="L12590">coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or</li>
<li class="L12591" rel="L12591">other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?</li>
<li class="L12592" rel="L12592">Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley&#39;s</li>
<li class="L12593" rel="L12593">way.”</li>
<li class="L12594" rel="L12594"></li>
<li class="L12595" rel="L12595">Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet</li>
<li class="L12596" rel="L12596">was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an</li>
<li class="L12597" rel="L12597">epithet.</li>
<li class="L12598" rel="L12598"></li>
<li class="L12599" rel="L12599">As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and</li>
<li class="L12600" rel="L12600">shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;</li>
<li class="L12601" rel="L12601">and he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes</li>
<li class="L12602" rel="L12602">hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”</li>
<li class="L12603" rel="L12603"></li>
<li class="L12604" rel="L12604">“I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to walk</li>
<li class="L12605" rel="L12605">to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has</li>
<li class="L12606" rel="L12606">never seen the view.”</li>
<li class="L12607" rel="L12607"></li>
<li class="L12608" rel="L12608">“It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I am</li>
<li class="L12609" rel="L12609">sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won&#39;t it, Kitty?” Kitty owned that</li>
<li class="L12610" rel="L12610">she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see</li>
<li class="L12611" rel="L12611">the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went</li>
<li class="L12612" rel="L12612">up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:</li>
<li class="L12613" rel="L12613"></li>
<li class="L12614" rel="L12614">“I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that</li>
<li class="L12615" rel="L12615">disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is</li>
<li class="L12616" rel="L12616">all for Jane&#39;s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking</li>
<li class="L12617" rel="L12617">to him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to</li>
<li class="L12618" rel="L12618">inconvenience.”</li>
<li class="L12619" rel="L12619"></li>
<li class="L12620" rel="L12620">During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet&#39;s consent should be</li>
<li class="L12621" rel="L12621">asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the</li>
<li class="L12622" rel="L12622">application for her mother&#39;s. She could not determine how her mother</li>
<li class="L12623" rel="L12623">would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur</li>
<li class="L12624" rel="L12624">would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she</li>
<li class="L12625" rel="L12625">were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it</li>
<li class="L12626" rel="L12626">was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit</li>
<li class="L12627" rel="L12627">to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear</li>
<li class="L12628" rel="L12628">the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her</li>
<li class="L12629" rel="L12629">disapprobation.</li>
<li class="L12630" rel="L12630"></li>
<li class="L12631" rel="L12631">                          * * * * *</li>
<li class="L12632" rel="L12632"></li>
<li class="L12633" rel="L12633">In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw</li>
<li class="L12634" rel="L12634">Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was</li>
<li class="L12635" rel="L12635">extreme. She did not fear her father&#39;s opposition, but he was going to</li>
<li class="L12636" rel="L12636">be made unhappy; and that it should be through her means--that _she_,</li>
<li class="L12637" rel="L12637">his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be</li>
<li class="L12638" rel="L12638">filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her--was a wretched</li>
<li class="L12639" rel="L12639">reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,</li>
<li class="L12640" rel="L12640">looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes</li>
<li class="L12641" rel="L12641">he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while</li>
<li class="L12642" rel="L12642">pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, “Go to your father, he</li>
<li class="L12643" rel="L12643">wants you in the library.” She was gone directly.</li>
<li class="L12644" rel="L12644"></li>
<li class="L12645" rel="L12645">Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.</li>
<li class="L12646" rel="L12646">“Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be</li>
<li class="L12647" rel="L12647">accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”</li>
<li class="L12648" rel="L12648"></li>
<li class="L12649" rel="L12649">How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more</li>
<li class="L12650" rel="L12650">reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from</li>
<li class="L12651" rel="L12651">explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;</li>
<li class="L12652" rel="L12652">but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,</li>
<li class="L12653" rel="L12653">of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.</li>
<li class="L12654" rel="L12654"></li>
<li class="L12655" rel="L12655">“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be</li>
<li class="L12656" rel="L12656">sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.</li>
<li class="L12657" rel="L12657">But will they make you happy?”</li>
<li class="L12658" rel="L12658"></li>
<li class="L12659" rel="L12659">“Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief of my</li>
<li class="L12660" rel="L12660">indifference?”</li>
<li class="L12661" rel="L12661"></li>
<li class="L12662" rel="L12662">“None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but</li>
<li class="L12663" rel="L12663">this would be nothing if you really liked him.”</li>
<li class="L12664" rel="L12664"></li>
<li class="L12665" rel="L12665">“I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes, “I love him.</li>
<li class="L12666" rel="L12666">Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not</li>
<li class="L12667" rel="L12667">know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in</li>
<li class="L12668" rel="L12668">such terms.”</li>
<li class="L12669" rel="L12669"></li>
<li class="L12670" rel="L12670">“Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the kind</li>
<li class="L12671" rel="L12671">of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he</li>
<li class="L12672" rel="L12672">condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on</li>
<li class="L12673" rel="L12673">having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know</li>
<li class="L12674" rel="L12674">your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor</li>
<li class="L12675" rel="L12675">respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked</li>
<li class="L12676" rel="L12676">up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the</li>
<li class="L12677" rel="L12677">greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape</li>
<li class="L12678" rel="L12678">discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing</li>
<li class="L12679" rel="L12679">_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are</li>
<li class="L12680" rel="L12680">about.”</li>
<li class="L12681" rel="L12681"></li>
<li class="L12682" rel="L12682">Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and</li>
<li class="L12683" rel="L12683">at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object</li>
<li class="L12684" rel="L12684">of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of</li>
<li class="L12685" rel="L12685">him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection</li>
<li class="L12686" rel="L12686">was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months&#39;</li>
<li class="L12687" rel="L12687">suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did</li>
<li class="L12688" rel="L12688">conquer her father&#39;s incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.</li>
<li class="L12689" rel="L12689"></li>
<li class="L12690" rel="L12690">“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no more to</li>
<li class="L12691" rel="L12691">say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with</li>
<li class="L12692" rel="L12692">you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”</li>
<li class="L12693" rel="L12693"></li>
<li class="L12694" rel="L12694">To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy</li>
<li class="L12695" rel="L12695">had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.</li>
<li class="L12696" rel="L12696"></li>
<li class="L12697" rel="L12697">“This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing;</li>
<li class="L12698" rel="L12698">made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow&#39;s debts, and got him</li>
<li class="L12699" rel="L12699">his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble</li>
<li class="L12700" rel="L12700">and economy. Had it been your uncle&#39;s doing, I must and _would_ have</li>
<li class="L12701" rel="L12701">paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own</li>
<li class="L12702" rel="L12702">way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about</li>
<li class="L12703" rel="L12703">his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”</li>
<li class="L12704" rel="L12704"></li>
<li class="L12705" rel="L12705">He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading</li>
<li class="L12706" rel="L12706">Mr. Collins&#39;s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her</li>
<li class="L12707" rel="L12707">at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come</li>
<li class="L12708" rel="L12708">for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”</li>
<li class="L12709" rel="L12709"></li>
<li class="L12710" rel="L12710">Elizabeth&#39;s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after</li>
<li class="L12711" rel="L12711">half an hour&#39;s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join</li>
<li class="L12712" rel="L12712">the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for</li>
<li class="L12713" rel="L12713">gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer</li>
<li class="L12714" rel="L12714">anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity</li>
<li class="L12715" rel="L12715">would come in time.</li>
<li class="L12716" rel="L12716"></li>
<li class="L12717" rel="L12717">When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,</li>
<li class="L12718" rel="L12718">and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;</li>
<li class="L12719" rel="L12719">for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to</li>
<li class="L12720" rel="L12720">utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could</li>
<li class="L12721" rel="L12721">comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit</li>
<li class="L12722" rel="L12722">what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a</li>
<li class="L12723" rel="L12723">lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in</li>
<li class="L12724" rel="L12724">her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.</li>
<li class="L12725" rel="L12725"></li>
<li class="L12726" rel="L12726">“Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would</li>
<li class="L12727" rel="L12727">have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich</li>
<li class="L12728" rel="L12728">and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages</li>
<li class="L12729" rel="L12729">you will have! Jane&#39;s is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so</li>
<li class="L12730" rel="L12730">pleased--so happy. Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my</li>
<li class="L12731" rel="L12731">dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I</li>
<li class="L12732" rel="L12732">hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing</li>
<li class="L12733" rel="L12733">that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,</li>
<li class="L12734" rel="L12734">Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted.”</li>
<li class="L12735" rel="L12735"></li>
<li class="L12736" rel="L12736">This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and</li>
<li class="L12737" rel="L12737">Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,</li>
<li class="L12738" rel="L12738">soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,</li>
<li class="L12739" rel="L12739">her mother followed her.</li>
<li class="L12740" rel="L12740"></li>
<li class="L12741" rel="L12741">“My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else! Ten</li>
<li class="L12742" rel="L12742">thousand a year, and very likely more! &#39;Tis as good as a Lord! And a</li>
<li class="L12743" rel="L12743">special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But</li>
<li class="L12744" rel="L12744">my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of,</li>
<li class="L12745" rel="L12745">that I may have it to-morrow.”</li>
<li class="L12746" rel="L12746"></li>
<li class="L12747" rel="L12747">This was a sad omen of what her mother&#39;s behaviour to the gentleman</li>
<li class="L12748" rel="L12748">himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain</li>
<li class="L12749" rel="L12749">possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations&#39;</li>
<li class="L12750" rel="L12750">consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow</li>
<li class="L12751" rel="L12751">passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood</li>
<li class="L12752" rel="L12752">in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to</li>
<li class="L12753" rel="L12753">him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her</li>
<li class="L12754" rel="L12754">deference for his opinion.</li>
<li class="L12755" rel="L12755"></li>
<li class="L12756" rel="L12756">Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get</li>
<li class="L12757" rel="L12757">acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising</li>
<li class="L12758" rel="L12758">every hour in his esteem.</li>
<li class="L12759" rel="L12759"></li>
<li class="L12760" rel="L12760">“I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “Wickham, perhaps,</li>
<li class="L12761" rel="L12761">is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well</li>
<li class="L12762" rel="L12762">as Jane&#39;s.”</li>

<li class="L12768" rel="L12768"></li>
<li class="L12769" rel="L12769">Elizabeth&#39;s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.</li>
<li class="L12770" rel="L12770">Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. “How could</li>
<li class="L12771" rel="L12771">you begin?” said she. “I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when</li>
<li class="L12772" rel="L12772">you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first</li>
<li class="L12773" rel="L12773">place?”</li>
<li class="L12774" rel="L12774"></li>
<li class="L12775" rel="L12775">“I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which</li>
<li class="L12776" rel="L12776">laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I</li>
<li class="L12777" rel="L12777">knew that I _had_ begun.”</li>
<li class="L12778" rel="L12778"></li>
<li class="L12779" rel="L12779">“My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour</li>
<li class="L12780" rel="L12780">to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke</li>
<li class="L12781" rel="L12781">to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere;</li>
<li class="L12782" rel="L12782">did you admire me for my impertinence?”</li>
<li class="L12783" rel="L12783"></li>
<li class="L12784" rel="L12784">“For the liveliness of your mind, I did.”</li>
<li class="L12785" rel="L12785"></li>
<li class="L12786" rel="L12786">“You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.</li>
<li class="L12787" rel="L12787">The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious</li>
<li class="L12788" rel="L12788">attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,</li>
<li class="L12789" rel="L12789">and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused, and</li>
<li class="L12790" rel="L12790">interested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really</li>
<li class="L12791" rel="L12791">amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you</li>
<li class="L12792" rel="L12792">took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and</li>
<li class="L12793" rel="L12793">in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously</li>
<li class="L12794" rel="L12794">courted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for</li>
<li class="L12795" rel="L12795">it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly</li>
<li class="L12796" rel="L12796">reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks</li>
<li class="L12797" rel="L12797">of _that_ when they fall in love.”</li>
<li class="L12798" rel="L12798"></li>
<li class="L12799" rel="L12799">“Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was</li>
<li class="L12800" rel="L12800">ill at Netherfield?”</li>
<li class="L12801" rel="L12801"></li>
<li class="L12802" rel="L12802">“Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it</li>
<li class="L12803" rel="L12803">by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are</li>
<li class="L12804" rel="L12804">to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me</li>
<li class="L12805" rel="L12805">to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may</li>
<li class="L12806" rel="L12806">be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling</li>
<li class="L12807" rel="L12807">to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first</li>
<li class="L12808" rel="L12808">called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did</li>
<li class="L12809" rel="L12809">you look as if you did not care about me?”</li>
<li class="L12810" rel="L12810"></li>
<li class="L12811" rel="L12811">“Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.”</li>
<li class="L12812" rel="L12812"></li>
<li class="L12813" rel="L12813">“But I was embarrassed.”</li>
<li class="L12814" rel="L12814"></li>
<li class="L12815" rel="L12815">“And so was I.”</li>
<li class="L12816" rel="L12816"></li>
<li class="L12817" rel="L12817">“You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.”</li>
<li class="L12818" rel="L12818"></li>
<li class="L12819" rel="L12819">“A man who had felt less, might.”</li>
<li class="L12820" rel="L12820"></li>
<li class="L12821" rel="L12821">“How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that</li>
<li class="L12822" rel="L12822">I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you</li>
<li class="L12823" rel="L12823">_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when</li>
<li class="L12824" rel="L12824">you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of</li>
<li class="L12825" rel="L12825">thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.</li>
<li class="L12826" rel="L12826">_Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort</li>
<li class="L12827" rel="L12827">springs from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the</li>
<li class="L12828" rel="L12828">subject. This will never do.”</li>
<li class="L12829" rel="L12829"></li>
<li class="L12830" rel="L12830">“You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady</li>
<li class="L12831" rel="L12831">Catherine&#39;s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of</li>
<li class="L12832" rel="L12832">removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to</li>
<li class="L12833" rel="L12833">your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour</li>
<li class="L12834" rel="L12834">to wait for any opening of yours. My aunt&#39;s intelligence had given me</li>
<li class="L12835" rel="L12835">hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.”</li>
<li class="L12836" rel="L12836"></li>
<li class="L12837" rel="L12837">“Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,</li>
<li class="L12838" rel="L12838">for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to</li>
<li class="L12839" rel="L12839">Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?</li>
<li class="L12840" rel="L12840">or had you intended any more serious consequence?”</li>
<li class="L12841" rel="L12841"></li>
<li class="L12842" rel="L12842">“My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I</li>
<li class="L12843" rel="L12843">might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to</li>
<li class="L12844" rel="L12844">myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley,</li>
<li class="L12845" rel="L12845">and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.”</li>
<li class="L12846" rel="L12846"></li>
<li class="L12847" rel="L12847">“Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to</li>
<li class="L12848" rel="L12848">befall her?”</li>
<li class="L12849" rel="L12849"></li>
<li class="L12850" rel="L12850">“I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth. But it</li>
<li class="L12851" rel="L12851">ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be</li>
<li class="L12852" rel="L12852">done directly.”</li>
<li class="L12853" rel="L12853"></li>
<li class="L12854" rel="L12854">“And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and</li>
<li class="L12855" rel="L12855">admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But</li>
<li class="L12856" rel="L12856">I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.”</li>
<li class="L12857" rel="L12857"></li>
<li class="L12858" rel="L12858">From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy</li>
<li class="L12859" rel="L12859">had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner&#39;s</li>
<li class="L12860" rel="L12860">long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would</li>
<li class="L12861" rel="L12861">be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and</li>
<li class="L12862" rel="L12862">aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as</li>
<li class="L12863" rel="L12863">follows:</li>
<li class="L12864" rel="L12864"></li>
<li class="L12865" rel="L12865">“I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,</li>
<li class="L12866" rel="L12866">for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the</li>
<li class="L12867" rel="L12867">truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.</li>
<li class="L12868" rel="L12868">But _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose rein to your</li>
<li class="L12869" rel="L12869">fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the</li>
<li class="L12870" rel="L12870">subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you</li>
<li class="L12871" rel="L12871">cannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a</li>
<li class="L12872" rel="L12872">great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again,</li>
<li class="L12873" rel="L12873">for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your</li>
<li class="L12874" rel="L12874">idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I</li>
<li class="L12875" rel="L12875">am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so</li>
<li class="L12876" rel="L12876">before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she</li>
<li class="L12877" rel="L12877">only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that</li>
<li class="L12878" rel="L12878">he can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.</li>
<li class="L12879" rel="L12879">Yours, etc.”</li>
<li class="L12880" rel="L12880"></li>
<li class="L12881" rel="L12881">Mr. Darcy&#39;s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still</li>
<li class="L12882" rel="L12882">different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply</li>
<li class="L12883" rel="L12883">to his last.</li>
<li class="L12884" rel="L12884"></li>
<li class="L12885" rel="L12885">“DEAR SIR,</li>
<li class="L12886" rel="L12886"></li>
<li class="L12887" rel="L12887">“I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon</li>
<li class="L12888" rel="L12888">be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can.</li>
<li class="L12889" rel="L12889">But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.</li>
<li class="L12890" rel="L12890"></li>
<li class="L12891" rel="L12891">“Yours sincerely, etc.”</li>
<li class="L12892" rel="L12892"></li>
<li class="L12893" rel="L12893">Miss Bingley&#39;s congratulations to her brother, on his approaching</li>
<li class="L12894" rel="L12894">marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even</li>
<li class="L12895" rel="L12895">to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her</li>
<li class="L12896" rel="L12896">former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was</li>
<li class="L12897" rel="L12897">affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing</li>
<li class="L12898" rel="L12898">her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.</li>
<li class="L12899" rel="L12899"></li>
<li class="L12900" rel="L12900">The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information,</li>
<li class="L12901" rel="L12901">was as sincere as her brother&#39;s in sending it. Four sides of paper were</li>
<li class="L12902" rel="L12902">insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of</li>
<li class="L12903" rel="L12903">being loved by her sister.</li>
<li class="L12904" rel="L12904"></li>
<li class="L12905" rel="L12905">Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations</li>
<li class="L12906" rel="L12906">to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the</li>
<li class="L12907" rel="L12907">Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this</li>
<li class="L12908" rel="L12908">sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered</li>
<li class="L12909" rel="L12909">so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew&#39;s letter, that</li>
<li class="L12910" rel="L12910">Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till</li>
<li class="L12911" rel="L12911">the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend</li>
<li class="L12912" rel="L12912">was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their</li>
<li class="L12913" rel="L12913">meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she</li>
<li class="L12914" rel="L12914">saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of</li>
<li class="L12915" rel="L12915">her husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even</li>
<li class="L12916" rel="L12916">listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away</li>
<li class="L12917" rel="L12917">the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all</li>
<li class="L12918" rel="L12918">meeting frequently at St. James&#39;s, with very decent composure. If he did</li>
<li class="L12919" rel="L12919">shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.</li>
<li class="L12920" rel="L12920"></li>
<li class="L12921" rel="L12921">Mrs. Phillips&#39;s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his</li>
<li class="L12922" rel="L12922">forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood in</li>
<li class="L12923" rel="L12923">too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley&#39;s good</li>
<li class="L12924" rel="L12924">humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.</li>
<li class="L12925" rel="L12925">Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all</li>
<li class="L12926" rel="L12926">likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield</li>
<li class="L12927" rel="L12927">him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep</li>
<li class="L12928" rel="L12928">him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse</li>
<li class="L12929" rel="L12929">without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising</li>
<li class="L12930" rel="L12930">from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it</li>
<li class="L12931" rel="L12931">added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to</li>
<li class="L12932" rel="L12932">the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing</li>
<li class="L12933" rel="L12933">to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at</li>
<li class="L12934" rel="L12934">Pemberley.</li>

<li class="L12940" rel="L12940"></li>
<li class="L12941" rel="L12941">Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got</li>
<li class="L12942" rel="L12942">rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride</li>
<li class="L12943" rel="L12943">she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may</li>
<li class="L12944" rel="L12944">be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the</li>
<li class="L12945" rel="L12945">accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many</li>
<li class="L12946" rel="L12946">of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,</li>
<li class="L12947" rel="L12947">amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it</li>
<li class="L12948" rel="L12948">was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity</li>
<li class="L12949" rel="L12949">in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and</li>
<li class="L12950" rel="L12950">invariably silly.</li>
<li class="L12951" rel="L12951"></li>
<li class="L12952" rel="L12952">Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her</li>
<li class="L12953" rel="L12953">drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in</li>
<li class="L12954" rel="L12954">going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.</li>
<li class="L12955" rel="L12955"></li>
<li class="L12956" rel="L12956">Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near</li>
<li class="L12957" rel="L12957">a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to</li>
<li class="L12958" rel="L12958">_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his</li>
<li class="L12959" rel="L12959">sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county</li>
<li class="L12960" rel="L12960">to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source</li>
<li class="L12961" rel="L12961">of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.</li>
<li class="L12962" rel="L12962"></li>
<li class="L12963" rel="L12963">Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with</li>
<li class="L12964" rel="L12964">her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally</li>
<li class="L12965" rel="L12965">known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a</li>
<li class="L12966" rel="L12966">temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia&#39;s example,</li>
<li class="L12967" rel="L12967">she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less</li>
<li class="L12968" rel="L12968">ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia&#39;s</li>
<li class="L12969" rel="L12969">society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham</li>
<li class="L12970" rel="L12970">frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of</li>
<li class="L12971" rel="L12971">balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.</li>
<li class="L12972" rel="L12972"></li>
<li class="L12973" rel="L12973">Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily</li>
<li class="L12974" rel="L12974">drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet&#39;s being quite</li>
<li class="L12975" rel="L12975">unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but</li>
<li class="L12976" rel="L12976">she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no</li>
<li class="L12977" rel="L12977">longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters&#39; beauty and her own,</li>
<li class="L12978" rel="L12978">it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without</li>
<li class="L12979" rel="L12979">much reluctance.</li>
<li class="L12980" rel="L12980"></li>
<li class="L12981" rel="L12981">As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from</li>
<li class="L12982" rel="L12982">the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that</li>
<li class="L12983" rel="L12983">Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude</li>
<li class="L12984" rel="L12984">and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every</li>
<li class="L12985" rel="L12985">thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on</li>
<li class="L12986" rel="L12986">to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received</li>
<li class="L12987" rel="L12987">from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,</li>
<li class="L12988" rel="L12988">if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this</li>
<li class="L12989" rel="L12989">effect:</li>
<li class="L12990" rel="L12990"></li>
<li class="L12991" rel="L12991">“MY DEAR LIZZY,</li>
<li class="L12992" rel="L12992"></li>
<li class="L12993" rel="L12993">“I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear</li>
<li class="L12994" rel="L12994">Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so</li>
<li class="L12995" rel="L12995">rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.</li>
<li class="L12996" rel="L12996">I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not</li>
<li class="L12997" rel="L12997">think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.</li>
<li class="L12998" rel="L12998">Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however,</li>
<li class="L12999" rel="L12999">do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.</li>
<li class="L13000" rel="L13000"></li>
<li class="L13001" rel="L13001">“Yours, etc.”</li>
<li class="L13002" rel="L13002"></li>
<li class="L13003" rel="L13003">As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in</li>
<li class="L13004" rel="L13004">her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.</li>
<li class="L13005" rel="L13005">Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice</li>
<li class="L13006" rel="L13006">of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she</li>
<li class="L13007" rel="L13007">frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an</li>
<li class="L13008" rel="L13008">income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in</li>
<li class="L13009" rel="L13009">their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to</li>
<li class="L13010" rel="L13010">their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or</li>
<li class="L13011" rel="L13011">herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance</li>
<li class="L13012" rel="L13012">towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the</li>
<li class="L13013" rel="L13013">restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the</li>
<li class="L13014" rel="L13014">extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap</li>
<li class="L13015" rel="L13015">situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for</li>
<li class="L13016" rel="L13016">her soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and</li>
<li class="L13017" rel="L13017">in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to</li>
<li class="L13018" rel="L13018">reputation which her marriage had given her.</li>
<li class="L13019" rel="L13019"></li>
<li class="L13020" rel="L13020">Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for</li>
<li class="L13021" rel="L13021">Elizabeth&#39;s sake, he assisted him further in his profession. Lydia was</li>
<li class="L13022" rel="L13022">occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself</li>
<li class="L13023" rel="L13023">in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently</li>
<li class="L13024" rel="L13024">staid so long, that even Bingley&#39;s good humour was overcome, and he</li>
<li class="L13025" rel="L13025">proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.</li>
<li class="L13026" rel="L13026"></li>
<li class="L13027" rel="L13027">Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy&#39;s marriage; but as she</li>
<li class="L13028" rel="L13028">thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she</li>
<li class="L13029" rel="L13029">dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as</li>
<li class="L13030" rel="L13030">attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility</li>
<li class="L13031" rel="L13031">to Elizabeth.</li>
<li class="L13032" rel="L13032"></li>
<li class="L13033" rel="L13033">Pemberley was now Georgiana&#39;s home; and the attachment of the sisters</li>
<li class="L13034" rel="L13034">was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each</li>
<li class="L13035" rel="L13035">other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion</li>
<li class="L13036" rel="L13036">in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with</li>
<li class="L13037" rel="L13037">an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of</li>
<li class="L13038" rel="L13038">talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect</li>
<li class="L13039" rel="L13039">which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open</li>
<li class="L13040" rel="L13040">pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen</li>
<li class="L13041" rel="L13041">in her way. By Elizabeth&#39;s instructions, she began to comprehend that</li>
<li class="L13042" rel="L13042">a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not</li>
<li class="L13043" rel="L13043">always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.</li>
<li class="L13044" rel="L13044"></li>
<li class="L13045" rel="L13045">Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;</li>
<li class="L13046" rel="L13046">and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in</li>
<li class="L13047" rel="L13047">her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him</li>
<li class="L13048" rel="L13048">language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time</li>
<li class="L13049" rel="L13049">all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth&#39;s persuasion,</li>
<li class="L13050" rel="L13050">he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;</li>
<li class="L13051" rel="L13051">and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her</li>
<li class="L13052" rel="L13052">resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity</li>
<li class="L13053" rel="L13053">to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait</li>
<li class="L13054" rel="L13054">on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had</li>
<li class="L13055" rel="L13055">received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the</li>
<li class="L13056" rel="L13056">visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.</li>
<li class="L13057" rel="L13057"></li>
<li class="L13058" rel="L13058">With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.</li>
<li class="L13059" rel="L13059">Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever</li>
<li class="L13060" rel="L13060">sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing</li>
<li class="L13061" rel="L13061">her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.</li>
