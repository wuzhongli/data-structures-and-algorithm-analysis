<li class="L111" rel="L111">I. The Period</li>
<li class="L112" rel="L112"></li>
<li class="L113" rel="L113"></li>
<li class="L114" rel="L114">It was the best of times,</li>
<li class="L115" rel="L115">it was the worst of times,</li>
<li class="L116" rel="L116">it was the age of wisdom,</li>
<li class="L117" rel="L117">it was the age of foolishness,</li>
<li class="L118" rel="L118">it was the epoch of belief,</li>
<li class="L119" rel="L119">it was the epoch of incredulity,</li>
<li class="L120" rel="L120">it was the season of Light,</li>
<li class="L121" rel="L121">it was the season of Darkness,</li>
<li class="L122" rel="L122">it was the spring of hope,</li>
<li class="L123" rel="L123">it was the winter of despair,</li>
<li class="L124" rel="L124">we had everything before us,</li>
<li class="L125" rel="L125">we had nothing before us,</li>
<li class="L126" rel="L126">we were all going direct to Heaven,</li>
<li class="L127" rel="L127">we were all going direct the other way--</li>
<li class="L128" rel="L128">in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of</li>
<li class="L129" rel="L129">its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for</li>
<li class="L130" rel="L130">evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.</li>
<li class="L131" rel="L131"></li>
<li class="L132" rel="L132">There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the</li>
<li class="L133" rel="L133">throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with</li>
<li class="L134" rel="L134">a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer</li>
<li class="L135" rel="L135">than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes,</li>
<li class="L136" rel="L136">that things in general were settled for ever.</li>
<li class="L137" rel="L137"></li>
<li class="L138" rel="L138">It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.</li>
<li class="L139" rel="L139">Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period,</li>
<li class="L140" rel="L140">as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth</li>
<li class="L141" rel="L141">blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had</li>
<li class="L142" rel="L142">heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were</li>
<li class="L143" rel="L143">made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane</li>
<li class="L144" rel="L144">ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its</li>
<li class="L145" rel="L145">messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally</li>
<li class="L146" rel="L146">deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the</li>
<li class="L147" rel="L147">earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People,</li>
<li class="L148" rel="L148">from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange</li>
<li class="L149" rel="L149">to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any</li>
<li class="L150" rel="L150">communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane</li>
<li class="L151" rel="L151">brood.</li>
<li class="L152" rel="L152"></li>
<li class="L153" rel="L153">France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her</li>
<li class="L154" rel="L154">sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down</li>
<li class="L155" rel="L155">hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her</li>
<li class="L156" rel="L156">Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane</li>
<li class="L157" rel="L157">achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue</li>
<li class="L158" rel="L158">torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not</li>
<li class="L159" rel="L159">kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks</li>
<li class="L160" rel="L160">which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty</li>
<li class="L161" rel="L161">yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and</li>
<li class="L162" rel="L162">Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death,</li>
<li class="L163" rel="L163">already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into</li>
<li class="L164" rel="L164">boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in</li>
<li class="L165" rel="L165">it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses</li>
<li class="L166" rel="L166">of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were</li>
<li class="L167" rel="L167">sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with</li>
<li class="L168" rel="L168">rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which</li>
<li class="L169" rel="L169">the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of</li>
<li class="L170" rel="L170">the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work</li>
<li class="L171" rel="L171">unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about</li>
<li class="L172" rel="L172">with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion</li>
<li class="L173" rel="L173">that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.</li>
<li class="L174" rel="L174"></li>
<li class="L175" rel="L175">In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to</li>
<li class="L176" rel="L176">justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and</li>
<li class="L177" rel="L177">highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night;</li>
<li class="L178" rel="L178">families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing</li>
<li class="L179" rel="L179">their furniture to upholsterers&#39; warehouses for security; the highwayman</li>
<li class="L180" rel="L180">in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and</li>
<li class="L181" rel="L181">challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of</li>
<li class="L182" rel="L182">“the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the</li>
<li class="L183" rel="L183">mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and</li>
<li class="L184" rel="L184">then got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the</li>
<li class="L185" rel="L185">failure of his ammunition:” after which the mail was robbed in peace;</li>
<li class="L186" rel="L186">that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand</li>
<li class="L187" rel="L187">and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the</li>
<li class="L188" rel="L188">illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London</li>
<li class="L189" rel="L189">gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law</li>
<li class="L190" rel="L190">fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball;</li>
<li class="L191" rel="L191">thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at</li>
<li class="L192" rel="L192">Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles&#39;s, to search</li>
<li class="L193" rel="L193">for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the</li>
<li class="L194" rel="L194">musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences</li>
<li class="L195" rel="L195">much out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy</li>
<li class="L196" rel="L196">and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing</li>
<li class="L197" rel="L197">up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on</li>
<li class="L198" rel="L198">Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the</li>
<li class="L199" rel="L199">hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of</li>
<li class="L200" rel="L200">Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer,</li>
<li class="L201" rel="L201">and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer&#39;s boy of</li>
<li class="L202" rel="L202">sixpence.</li>
<li class="L203" rel="L203"></li>
<li class="L204" rel="L204">All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close</li>
<li class="L205" rel="L205">upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.</li>
<li class="L206" rel="L206">Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded,</li>
<li class="L207" rel="L207">those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the</li>
<li class="L208" rel="L208">fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights</li>
<li class="L209" rel="L209">with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred</li>
<li class="L210" rel="L210">and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small</li>
<li class="L211" rel="L211">creatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the</li>
<li class="L212" rel="L212">roads that lay before them.</li>
<li class="L213" rel="L213"></li>
<li class="L214" rel="L214"></li>
<li class="L215" rel="L215"></li>
<li class="L216" rel="L216"></li>
<li class="L217" rel="L217">II. The Mail</li>
<li class="L218" rel="L218"></li>
<li class="L219" rel="L219"></li>
<li class="L220" rel="L220">It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November,</li>
<li class="L221" rel="L221">before the first of the persons with whom this history has business.</li>
<li class="L222" rel="L222">The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up</li>
<li class="L223" rel="L223">Shooter&#39;s Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail,</li>
<li class="L224" rel="L224">as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish</li>
<li class="L225" rel="L225">for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill,</li>
<li class="L226" rel="L226">and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the</li>
<li class="L227" rel="L227">horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the</li>
<li class="L228" rel="L228">coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back</li>
<li class="L229" rel="L229">to Blackheath. Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in</li>
<li class="L230" rel="L230">combination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose</li>
<li class="L231" rel="L231">otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals</li>
<li class="L232" rel="L232">are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to</li>
<li class="L233" rel="L233">their duty.</li>
<li class="L234" rel="L234"></li>
<li class="L235" rel="L235">With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through</li>
<li class="L236" rel="L236">the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were</li>
<li class="L237" rel="L237">falling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver rested</li>
<li class="L238" rel="L238">them and brought them to a stand, with a wary “Wo-ho! so-ho-then!” the</li>
<li class="L239" rel="L239">near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it--like an</li>
<li class="L240" rel="L240">unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the</li>
<li class="L241" rel="L241">hill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a</li>
<li class="L242" rel="L242">nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.</li>
<li class="L243" rel="L243"></li>
<li class="L244" rel="L244">There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its</li>
<li class="L245" rel="L245">forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding</li>
<li class="L246" rel="L246">none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the</li>
<li class="L247" rel="L247">air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the</li>
<li class="L248" rel="L248">waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out</li>
<li class="L249" rel="L249">everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings,</li>
<li class="L250" rel="L250">and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed</li>
<li class="L251" rel="L251">into it, as if they had made it all.</li>
<li class="L252" rel="L252"></li>
<li class="L253" rel="L253">Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the</li>
<li class="L254" rel="L254">side of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the</li>
<li class="L255" rel="L255">ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from</li>
<li class="L256" rel="L256">anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was</li>
<li class="L257" rel="L257">hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from</li>
<li class="L258" rel="L258">the eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers</li>
<li class="L259" rel="L259">were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on</li>
<li class="L260" rel="L260">the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter,</li>
<li class="L261" rel="L261">when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in</li>
<li class="L262" rel="L262">“the Captain&#39;s” pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable</li>
<li class="L263" rel="L263">non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard</li>
<li class="L264" rel="L264">of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one</li>
<li class="L265" rel="L265">thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter&#39;s Hill, as</li>
<li class="L266" rel="L266">he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet,</li>
<li class="L267" rel="L267">and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a</li>
<li class="L268" rel="L268">loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols,</li>
<li class="L269" rel="L269">deposited on a substratum of cutlass.</li>
<li class="L270" rel="L270"></li>
<li class="L271" rel="L271">The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected</li>
<li class="L272" rel="L272">the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they</li>
<li class="L273" rel="L273">all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but</li>
<li class="L274" rel="L274">the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have</li>
<li class="L275" rel="L275">taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the</li>
<li class="L276" rel="L276">journey.</li>
<li class="L277" rel="L277"></li>
<li class="L278" rel="L278">“Wo-ho!” said the coachman. “So, then! One more pull and you&#39;re at the</li>
<li class="L279" rel="L279">top and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get you to</li>
<li class="L280" rel="L280">it!--Joe!”</li>
<li class="L281" rel="L281"></li>
<li class="L282" rel="L282">“Halloa!” the guard replied.</li>
<li class="L283" rel="L283"></li>
<li class="L284" rel="L284">“What o&#39;clock do you make it, Joe?”</li>
<li class="L285" rel="L285"></li>
<li class="L286" rel="L286">“Ten minutes, good, past eleven.”</li>
<li class="L287" rel="L287"></li>
<li class="L288" rel="L288">“My blood!” ejaculated the vexed coachman, “and not atop of Shooter&#39;s</li>
<li class="L289" rel="L289">yet! Tst! Yah! Get on with you!”</li>
<li class="L290" rel="L290"></li>
<li class="L291" rel="L291">The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative,</li>
<li class="L292" rel="L292">made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed</li>
<li class="L293" rel="L293">suit. Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its</li>
<li class="L294" rel="L294">passengers squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the coach</li>
<li class="L295" rel="L295">stopped, and they kept close company with it. If any one of the three</li>
<li class="L296" rel="L296">had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead</li>
<li class="L297" rel="L297">into the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of</li>
<li class="L298" rel="L298">getting shot instantly as a highwayman.</li>
<li class="L299" rel="L299"></li>
<li class="L300" rel="L300">The last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. The horses</li>
<li class="L301" rel="L301">stopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for</li>
<li class="L302" rel="L302">the descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in.</li>
<li class="L303" rel="L303"></li>
<li class="L304" rel="L304">“Tst! Joe!” cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down from his</li>
<li class="L305" rel="L305">box.</li>
<li class="L306" rel="L306"></li>
<li class="L307" rel="L307">“What do you say, Tom?”</li>
<li class="L308" rel="L308"></li>
<li class="L309" rel="L309">They both listened.</li>
<li class="L310" rel="L310"></li>
<li class="L311" rel="L311">“I say a horse at a canter coming up, Joe.”</li>
<li class="L312" rel="L312"></li>
<li class="L313" rel="L313">“_I_ say a horse at a gallop, Tom,” returned the guard, leaving his hold</li>
<li class="L314" rel="L314">of the door, and mounting nimbly to his place. “Gentlemen! In the king&#39;s</li>
<li class="L315" rel="L315">name, all of you!”</li>
<li class="L316" rel="L316"></li>
<li class="L317" rel="L317">With this hurried adjuration, he cocked his blunderbuss, and stood on</li>
<li class="L318" rel="L318">the offensive.</li>
<li class="L319" rel="L319"></li>
<li class="L320" rel="L320">The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in;</li>
<li class="L321" rel="L321">the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow. He</li>
<li class="L322" rel="L322">remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of; they remained</li>
<li class="L323" rel="L323">in the road below him. They all looked from the coachman to the guard,</li>
<li class="L324" rel="L324">and from the guard to the coachman, and listened. The coachman looked</li>
<li class="L325" rel="L325">back and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up</li>
<li class="L326" rel="L326">his ears and looked back, without contradicting.</li>
<li class="L327" rel="L327"></li>
<li class="L328" rel="L328">The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring</li>
<li class="L329" rel="L329">of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet</li>
<li class="L330" rel="L330">indeed. The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to</li>
<li class="L331" rel="L331">the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. The hearts of the</li>
<li class="L332" rel="L332">passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the</li>
<li class="L333" rel="L333">quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding</li>
<li class="L334" rel="L334">the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation.</li>
<li class="L335" rel="L335"></li>
<li class="L336" rel="L336">The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.</li>
<li class="L337" rel="L337"></li>
<li class="L338" rel="L338">“So-ho!” the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. “Yo there! Stand!</li>
<li class="L339" rel="L339">I shall fire!”</li>
<li class="L340" rel="L340"></li>
<li class="L341" rel="L341">The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering,</li>
<li class="L342" rel="L342">a man&#39;s voice called from the mist, “Is that the Dover mail?”</li>
<li class="L343" rel="L343"></li>
<li class="L344" rel="L344">“Never you mind what it is!” the guard retorted. “What are you?”</li>
<li class="L345" rel="L345"></li>
<li class="L346" rel="L346">“_Is_ that the Dover mail?”</li>
<li class="L347" rel="L347"></li>
<li class="L348" rel="L348">“Why do you want to know?”</li>
<li class="L349" rel="L349"></li>
<li class="L350" rel="L350">“I want a passenger, if it is.”</li>
<li class="L351" rel="L351"></li>
<li class="L352" rel="L352">“What passenger?”</li>
<li class="L353" rel="L353"></li>
<li class="L354" rel="L354">“Mr. Jarvis Lorry.”</li>
<li class="L355" rel="L355"></li>
<li class="L356" rel="L356">Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name. The guard,</li>
<li class="L357" rel="L357">the coachman, and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully.</li>
<li class="L358" rel="L358"></li>
<li class="L359" rel="L359">“Keep where you are,” the guard called to the voice in the mist,</li>
<li class="L360" rel="L360">“because, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right in</li>
<li class="L361" rel="L361">your lifetime. Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight.”</li>
<li class="L362" rel="L362"></li>
<li class="L363" rel="L363">“What is the matter?” asked the passenger, then, with mildly quavering</li>
<li class="L364" rel="L364">speech. “Who wants me? Is it Jerry?”</li>
<li class="L365" rel="L365"></li>
<li class="L366" rel="L366">(“I don&#39;t like Jerry&#39;s voice, if it is Jerry,” growled the guard to</li>
<li class="L367" rel="L367">himself. “He&#39;s hoarser than suits me, is Jerry.”)</li>
<li class="L368" rel="L368"></li>
<li class="L369" rel="L369">“Yes, Mr. Lorry.”</li>
<li class="L370" rel="L370"></li>
<li class="L371" rel="L371">“What is the matter?”</li>
<li class="L372" rel="L372"></li>
<li class="L373" rel="L373">“A despatch sent after you from over yonder. T. and Co.”</li>
<li class="L374" rel="L374"></li>
<li class="L375" rel="L375">“I know this messenger, guard,” said Mr. Lorry, getting down into the</li>
<li class="L376" rel="L376">road--assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two</li>
<li class="L377" rel="L377">passengers, who immediately scrambled into the coach, shut the door, and</li>
<li class="L378" rel="L378">pulled up the window. “He may come close; there&#39;s nothing wrong.”</li>
<li class="L379" rel="L379"></li>
<li class="L380" rel="L380">“I hope there ain&#39;t, but I can&#39;t make so &#39;Nation sure of that,” said the</li>
<li class="L381" rel="L381">guard, in gruff soliloquy. “Hallo you!”</li>
<li class="L382" rel="L382"></li>
<li class="L383" rel="L383">“Well! And hallo you!” said Jerry, more hoarsely than before.</li>
<li class="L384" rel="L384"></li>
<li class="L385" rel="L385">“Come on at a footpace! d&#39;ye mind me? And if you&#39;ve got holsters to that</li>
<li class="L386" rel="L386">saddle o&#39; yourn, don&#39;t let me see your hand go nigh &#39;em. For I&#39;m a devil</li>
<li class="L387" rel="L387">at a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of Lead. So</li>
<li class="L388" rel="L388">now let&#39;s look at you.”</li>
<li class="L389" rel="L389"></li>
<li class="L390" rel="L390">The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist,</li>
<li class="L391" rel="L391">and came to the side of the mail, where the passenger stood. The rider</li>
<li class="L392" rel="L392">stooped, and, casting up his eyes at the guard, handed the passenger</li>
<li class="L393" rel="L393">a small folded paper. The rider&#39;s horse was blown, and both horse and</li>
<li class="L394" rel="L394">rider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of</li>
<li class="L395" rel="L395">the man.</li>
<li class="L396" rel="L396"></li>
<li class="L397" rel="L397">“Guard!” said the passenger, in a tone of quiet business confidence.</li>
<li class="L398" rel="L398"></li>
<li class="L399" rel="L399">The watchful guard, with his right hand at the stock of his raised</li>
<li class="L400" rel="L400">blunderbuss, his left at the barrel, and his eye on the horseman,</li>
<li class="L401" rel="L401">answered curtly, “Sir.”</li>
<li class="L402" rel="L402"></li>
<li class="L403" rel="L403">“There is nothing to apprehend. I belong to Tellson&#39;s Bank. You must</li>
<li class="L404" rel="L404">know Tellson&#39;s Bank in London. I am going to Paris on business. A crown</li>
<li class="L405" rel="L405">to drink. I may read this?”</li>
<li class="L406" rel="L406"></li>
<li class="L407" rel="L407">“If so be as you&#39;re quick, sir.”</li>
<li class="L408" rel="L408"></li>
<li class="L409" rel="L409">He opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side, and</li>
<li class="L410" rel="L410">read--first to himself and then aloud: “&#39;Wait at Dover for Mam&#39;selle.&#39;</li>
<li class="L411" rel="L411">It&#39;s not long, you see, guard. Jerry, say that my answer was, RECALLED</li>
<li class="L412" rel="L412">TO LIFE.”</li>
<li class="L413" rel="L413"></li>
<li class="L414" rel="L414">Jerry started in his saddle. “That&#39;s a Blazing strange answer, too,”</li>
<li class="L415" rel="L415"> said he, at his hoarsest.</li>
<li class="L416" rel="L416"></li>
<li class="L417" rel="L417">“Take that message back, and they will know that I received this, as</li>
<li class="L418" rel="L418">well as if I wrote. Make the best of your way. Good night.”</li>
<li class="L419" rel="L419"></li>
<li class="L420" rel="L420">With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in; not at</li>
<li class="L421" rel="L421">all assisted by his fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously secreted</li>
<li class="L422" rel="L422">their watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a general</li>
<li class="L423" rel="L423">pretence of being asleep. With no more definite purpose than to escape</li>
<li class="L424" rel="L424">the hazard of originating any other kind of action.</li>
<li class="L425" rel="L425"></li>
<li class="L426" rel="L426">The coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing round</li>
<li class="L427" rel="L427">it as it began the descent. The guard soon replaced his blunderbuss</li>
<li class="L428" rel="L428">in his arm-chest, and, having looked to the rest of its contents, and</li>
<li class="L429" rel="L429">having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt,</li>
<li class="L430" rel="L430">looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat, in which there were a</li>
<li class="L431" rel="L431">few smith&#39;s tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box. For he was</li>
<li class="L432" rel="L432">furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown</li>
<li class="L433" rel="L433">and stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut</li>
<li class="L434" rel="L434">himself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw,</li>
<li class="L435" rel="L435">and get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were lucky) in</li>
<li class="L436" rel="L436">five minutes.</li>
<li class="L437" rel="L437"></li>
<li class="L438" rel="L438">“Tom!” softly over the coach roof.</li>
<li class="L439" rel="L439"></li>
<li class="L440" rel="L440">“Hallo, Joe.”</li>
<li class="L441" rel="L441"></li>
<li class="L442" rel="L442">“Did you hear the message?”</li>
<li class="L443" rel="L443"></li>
<li class="L444" rel="L444">“I did, Joe.”</li>
<li class="L445" rel="L445"></li>
<li class="L446" rel="L446">“What did you make of it, Tom?”</li>
<li class="L447" rel="L447"></li>
<li class="L448" rel="L448">“Nothing at all, Joe.”</li>
<li class="L449" rel="L449"></li>
<li class="L450" rel="L450">“That&#39;s a coincidence, too,” the guard mused, “for I made the same of it</li>
<li class="L451" rel="L451">myself.”</li>
<li class="L452" rel="L452"></li>
<li class="L453" rel="L453">Jerry, left alone in the mist and darkness, dismounted meanwhile, not</li>
<li class="L454" rel="L454">only to ease his spent horse, but to wipe the mud from his face, and</li>
<li class="L455" rel="L455">shake the wet out of his hat-brim, which might be capable of</li>
<li class="L456" rel="L456">holding about half a gallon. After standing with the bridle over his</li>
<li class="L457" rel="L457">heavily-splashed arm, until the wheels of the mail were no longer within</li>
<li class="L458" rel="L458">hearing and the night was quite still again, he turned to walk down the</li>
<li class="L459" rel="L459">hill.</li>
<li class="L460" rel="L460"></li>
<li class="L461" rel="L461">“After that there gallop from Temple Bar, old lady, I won&#39;t trust your</li>
<li class="L462" rel="L462">fore-legs till I get you on the level,” said this hoarse messenger,</li>
<li class="L463" rel="L463">glancing at his mare. “&#39;Recalled to life.&#39; That&#39;s a Blazing strange</li>
<li class="L464" rel="L464">message. Much of that wouldn&#39;t do for you, Jerry! I say, Jerry! You&#39;d</li>
<li class="L465" rel="L465">be in a Blazing bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion,</li>
<li class="L466" rel="L466">Jerry!”</li>
<li class="L467" rel="L467"></li>
<li class="L468" rel="L468"></li>
<li class="L469" rel="L469"></li>
<li class="L470" rel="L470"></li>
<li class="L471" rel="L471">III. The Night Shadows</li>
<li class="L472" rel="L472"></li>
<li class="L473" rel="L473"></li>
<li class="L474" rel="L474">A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is</li>
<li class="L475" rel="L475">constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A</li>
<li class="L476" rel="L476">solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every</li>
<li class="L477" rel="L477">one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every</li>
<li class="L478" rel="L478">room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating</li>
<li class="L479" rel="L479">heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of</li>
<li class="L480" rel="L480">its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it! Something of the</li>
<li class="L481" rel="L481">awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this. No more can I</li>
<li class="L482" rel="L482">turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time</li>
<li class="L483" rel="L483">to read it all. No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable</li>
<li class="L484" rel="L484">water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses</li>
<li class="L485" rel="L485">of buried treasure and other things submerged. It was appointed that the</li>
<li class="L486" rel="L486">book should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read</li>
<li class="L487" rel="L487">but a page. It was appointed that the water should be locked in an</li>
<li class="L488" rel="L488">eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood</li>
<li class="L489" rel="L489">in ignorance on the shore. My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead,</li>
<li class="L490" rel="L490">my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable</li>
<li class="L491" rel="L491">consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that</li>
<li class="L492" rel="L492">individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life&#39;s end. In</li>
<li class="L493" rel="L493">any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass, is there</li>
<li class="L494" rel="L494">a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their</li>
<li class="L495" rel="L495">innermost personality, to me, or than I am to them?</li>
<li class="L496" rel="L496"></li>
<li class="L497" rel="L497">As to this, his natural and not to be alienated inheritance, the</li>
<li class="L498" rel="L498">messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the King, the</li>
<li class="L499" rel="L499">first Minister of State, or the richest merchant in London. So with the</li>
<li class="L500" rel="L500">three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail</li>
<li class="L501" rel="L501">coach; they were mysteries to one another, as complete as if each had</li>
<li class="L502" rel="L502">been in his own coach and six, or his own coach and sixty, with the</li>
<li class="L503" rel="L503">breadth of a county between him and the next.</li>
<li class="L504" rel="L504"></li>
<li class="L505" rel="L505">The messenger rode back at an easy trot, stopping pretty often at</li>
<li class="L506" rel="L506">ale-houses by the way to drink, but evincing a tendency to keep his</li>
<li class="L507" rel="L507">own counsel, and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes. He had eyes that</li>
<li class="L508" rel="L508">assorted very well with that decoration, being of a surface black, with</li>
<li class="L509" rel="L509">no depth in the colour or form, and much too near together--as if they</li>
<li class="L510" rel="L510">were afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept too</li>
<li class="L511" rel="L511">far apart. They had a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat like</li>
<li class="L512" rel="L512">a three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for the chin and</li>
<li class="L513" rel="L513">throat, which descended nearly to the wearer&#39;s knees. When he stopped</li>
<li class="L514" rel="L514">for drink, he moved this muffler with his left hand, only while he</li>
<li class="L515" rel="L515">poured his liquor in with his right; as soon as that was done, he</li>
<li class="L516" rel="L516">muffled again.</li>
<li class="L517" rel="L517"></li>
<li class="L518" rel="L518">“No, Jerry, no!” said the messenger, harping on one theme as he rode.</li>
<li class="L519" rel="L519">“It wouldn&#39;t do for you, Jerry. Jerry, you honest tradesman, it wouldn&#39;t</li>
<li class="L520" rel="L520">suit _your_ line of business! Recalled--! Bust me if I don&#39;t think he&#39;d</li>
<li class="L521" rel="L521">been a drinking!”</li>
<li class="L522" rel="L522"></li>
<li class="L523" rel="L523">His message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain, several</li>
<li class="L524" rel="L524">times, to take off his hat to scratch his head. Except on the crown,</li>
<li class="L525" rel="L525">which was raggedly bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all</li>
<li class="L526" rel="L526">over it, and growing down hill almost to his broad, blunt nose. It was</li>
<li class="L527" rel="L527">so like Smith&#39;s work, so much more like the top of a strongly spiked</li>
<li class="L528" rel="L528">wall than a head of hair, that the best of players at leap-frog might</li>
<li class="L529" rel="L529">have declined him, as the most dangerous man in the world to go over.</li>
<li class="L530" rel="L530"></li>
<li class="L531" rel="L531">While he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night</li>
<li class="L532" rel="L532">watchman in his box at the door of Tellson&#39;s Bank, by Temple Bar, who</li>
<li class="L533" rel="L533">was to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the</li>
<li class="L534" rel="L534">night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message, and took such</li>
<li class="L535" rel="L535">shapes to the mare as arose out of _her_ private topics of uneasiness.</li>
<li class="L536" rel="L536">They seemed to be numerous, for she shied at every shadow on the road.</li>
<li class="L537" rel="L537"></li>
<li class="L538" rel="L538">What time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped upon</li>
<li class="L539" rel="L539">its tedious way, with its three fellow-inscrutables inside. To whom,</li>
<li class="L540" rel="L540">likewise, the shadows of the night revealed themselves, in the forms</li>
<li class="L541" rel="L541">their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested.</li>
<li class="L542" rel="L542"></li>
<li class="L543" rel="L543">Tellson&#39;s Bank had a run upon it in the mail. As the bank</li>
<li class="L544" rel="L544">passenger--with an arm drawn through the leathern strap, which did what</li>
<li class="L545" rel="L545">lay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger,</li>
<li class="L546" rel="L546">and driving him into his corner, whenever the coach got a special</li>
<li class="L547" rel="L547">jolt--nodded in his place, with half-shut eyes, the little</li>
<li class="L548" rel="L548">coach-windows, and the coach-lamp dimly gleaming through them, and the</li>
<li class="L549" rel="L549">bulky bundle of opposite passenger, became the bank, and did a great</li>
<li class="L550" rel="L550">stroke of business. The rattle of the harness was the chink of money,</li>
<li class="L551" rel="L551">and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even Tellson&#39;s, with</li>
<li class="L552" rel="L552">all its foreign and home connection, ever paid in thrice the time. Then</li>
<li class="L553" rel="L553">the strong-rooms underground, at Tellson&#39;s, with such of their valuable</li>
<li class="L554" rel="L554">stores and secrets as were known to the passenger (and it was not a</li>
<li class="L555" rel="L555">little that he knew about them), opened before him, and he went in among</li>
<li class="L556" rel="L556">them with the great keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them</li>
<li class="L557" rel="L557">safe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as he had last seen them.</li>
<li class="L558" rel="L558"></li>
<li class="L559" rel="L559">But, though the bank was almost always with him, and though the coach</li>
<li class="L560" rel="L560">(in a confused way, like the presence of pain under an opiate) was</li>
<li class="L561" rel="L561">always with him, there was another current of impression that never</li>
<li class="L562" rel="L562">ceased to run, all through the night. He was on his way to dig some one</li>
<li class="L563" rel="L563">out of a grave.</li>
<li class="L564" rel="L564"></li>
<li class="L565" rel="L565">Now, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him</li>
<li class="L566" rel="L566">was the true face of the buried person, the shadows of the night did</li>
<li class="L567" rel="L567">not indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by</li>
<li class="L568" rel="L568">years, and they differed principally in the passions they expressed,</li>
<li class="L569" rel="L569">and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state. Pride, contempt,</li>
<li class="L570" rel="L570">defiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another;</li>
<li class="L571" rel="L571">so did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands</li>
<li class="L572" rel="L572">and figures. But the face was in the main one face, and every head was</li>
<li class="L573" rel="L573">prematurely white. A hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this</li>
<li class="L574" rel="L574">spectre:</li>
<li class="L575" rel="L575"></li>
<li class="L576" rel="L576">“Buried how long?”</li>
<li class="L577" rel="L577"></li>
<li class="L578" rel="L578">The answer was always the same: “Almost eighteen years.”</li>
<li class="L579" rel="L579"></li>
<li class="L580" rel="L580">“You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?”</li>
<li class="L581" rel="L581"></li>
<li class="L582" rel="L582">“Long ago.”</li>
<li class="L583" rel="L583"></li>
<li class="L584" rel="L584">“You know that you are recalled to life?”</li>
<li class="L585" rel="L585"></li>
<li class="L586" rel="L586">“They tell me so.”</li>
<li class="L587" rel="L587"></li>
<li class="L588" rel="L588">“I hope you care to live?”</li>
<li class="L589" rel="L589"></li>
<li class="L590" rel="L590">“I can&#39;t say.”</li>
<li class="L591" rel="L591"></li>
<li class="L592" rel="L592">“Shall I show her to you? Will you come and see her?”</li>
<li class="L593" rel="L593"></li>
<li class="L594" rel="L594">The answers to this question were various and contradictory. Sometimes</li>
<li class="L595" rel="L595">the broken reply was, “Wait! It would kill me if I saw her too soon.”</li>
<li class="L596" rel="L596"> Sometimes, it was given in a tender rain of tears, and then it was,</li>
<li class="L597" rel="L597">“Take me to her.” Sometimes it was staring and bewildered, and then it</li>
<li class="L598" rel="L598">was, “I don&#39;t know her. I don&#39;t understand.”</li>
<li class="L599" rel="L599"></li>
<li class="L600" rel="L600">After such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his fancy would dig,</li>
<li class="L601" rel="L601">and dig, dig--now with a spade, now with a great key, now with his</li>
<li class="L602" rel="L602">hands--to dig this wretched creature out. Got out at last, with earth</li>
<li class="L603" rel="L603">hanging about his face and hair, he would suddenly fan away to dust. The</li>
<li class="L604" rel="L604">passenger would then start to himself, and lower the window, to get the</li>
<li class="L605" rel="L605">reality of mist and rain on his cheek.</li>
<li class="L606" rel="L606"></li>
<li class="L607" rel="L607">Yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain, on the moving</li>
<li class="L608" rel="L608">patch of light from the lamps, and the hedge at the roadside retreating</li>
<li class="L609" rel="L609">by jerks, the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train</li>
<li class="L610" rel="L610">of the night shadows within. The real Banking-house by Temple Bar, the</li>
<li class="L611" rel="L611">real business of the past day, the real strong rooms, the real express</li>
<li class="L612" rel="L612">sent after him, and the real message returned, would all be there. Out</li>
<li class="L613" rel="L613">of the midst of them, the ghostly face would rise, and he would accost</li>
<li class="L614" rel="L614">it again.</li>
<li class="L615" rel="L615"></li>
<li class="L616" rel="L616">“Buried how long?”</li>
<li class="L617" rel="L617"></li>
<li class="L618" rel="L618">“Almost eighteen years.”</li>
<li class="L619" rel="L619"></li>
<li class="L620" rel="L620">“I hope you care to live?”</li>
<li class="L621" rel="L621"></li>
<li class="L622" rel="L622">“I can&#39;t say.”</li>
<li class="L623" rel="L623"></li>
<li class="L624" rel="L624">Dig--dig--dig--until an impatient movement from one of the two</li>
<li class="L625" rel="L625">passengers would admonish him to pull up the window, draw his arm</li>
<li class="L626" rel="L626">securely through the leathern strap, and speculate upon the two</li>
<li class="L627" rel="L627">slumbering forms, until his mind lost its hold of them, and they again</li>
<li class="L628" rel="L628">slid away into the bank and the grave.</li>
<li class="L629" rel="L629"></li>
<li class="L630" rel="L630">“Buried how long?”</li>
<li class="L631" rel="L631"></li>
<li class="L632" rel="L632">“Almost eighteen years.”</li>
<li class="L633" rel="L633"></li>
<li class="L634" rel="L634">“You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?”</li>
<li class="L635" rel="L635"></li>
<li class="L636" rel="L636">“Long ago.”</li>
<li class="L637" rel="L637"></li>
<li class="L638" rel="L638">The words were still in his hearing as just spoken--distinctly in</li>
<li class="L639" rel="L639">his hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life--when the weary</li>
<li class="L640" rel="L640">passenger started to the consciousness of daylight, and found that the</li>
<li class="L641" rel="L641">shadows of the night were gone.</li>
<li class="L642" rel="L642"></li>
<li class="L643" rel="L643">He lowered the window, and looked out at the rising sun. There was a</li>
<li class="L644" rel="L644">ridge of ploughed land, with a plough upon it where it had been left</li>
<li class="L645" rel="L645">last night when the horses were unyoked; beyond, a quiet coppice-wood,</li>
<li class="L646" rel="L646">in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained</li>
<li class="L647" rel="L647">upon the trees. Though the earth was cold and wet, the sky was clear,</li>
<li class="L648" rel="L648">and the sun rose bright, placid, and beautiful.</li>
<li class="L649" rel="L649"></li>
<li class="L650" rel="L650">“Eighteen years!” said the passenger, looking at the sun. “Gracious</li>
<li class="L651" rel="L651">Creator of day! To be buried alive for eighteen years!”</li>
<li class="L652" rel="L652"></li>
<li class="L653" rel="L653"></li>
<li class="L654" rel="L654"></li>
<li class="L655" rel="L655"></li>
<li class="L656" rel="L656">IV. The Preparation</li>
<li class="L657" rel="L657"></li>
<li class="L658" rel="L658"></li>
<li class="L659" rel="L659">When the mail got successfully to Dover, in the course of the forenoon,</li>
<li class="L660" rel="L660">the head drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door as his</li>
<li class="L661" rel="L661">custom was. He did it with some flourish of ceremony, for a mail journey</li>
<li class="L662" rel="L662">from London in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous</li>
<li class="L663" rel="L663">traveller upon.</li>
<li class="L664" rel="L664"></li>
<li class="L665" rel="L665">By that time, there was only one adventurous traveller left be</li>
<li class="L666" rel="L666">congratulated: for the two others had been set down at their respective</li>
<li class="L667" rel="L667">roadside destinations. The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp</li>
<li class="L668" rel="L668">and dirty straw, its disagreeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather</li>
<li class="L669" rel="L669">like a larger dog-kennel. Mr. Lorry, the passenger, shaking himself out</li>
<li class="L670" rel="L670">of it in chains of straw, a tangle of shaggy wrapper, flapping hat, and</li>
<li class="L671" rel="L671">muddy legs, was rather like a larger sort of dog.</li>
<li class="L672" rel="L672"></li>
<li class="L673" rel="L673">“There will be a packet to Calais, tomorrow, drawer?”</li>
<li class="L674" rel="L674"></li>
<li class="L675" rel="L675">“Yes, sir, if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair. The</li>
<li class="L676" rel="L676">tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon, sir. Bed,</li>
<li class="L677" rel="L677">sir?”</li>
<li class="L678" rel="L678"></li>
<li class="L679" rel="L679">“I shall not go to bed till night; but I want a bedroom, and a barber.”</li>
<li class="L680" rel="L680"></li>
<li class="L681" rel="L681">“And then breakfast, sir? Yes, sir. That way, sir, if you please.</li>
<li class="L682" rel="L682">Show Concord! Gentleman&#39;s valise and hot water to Concord. Pull off</li>
<li class="L683" rel="L683">gentleman&#39;s boots in Concord. (You will find a fine sea-coal fire, sir.)</li>
<li class="L684" rel="L684">Fetch barber to Concord. Stir about there, now, for Concord!”</li>
<li class="L685" rel="L685"></li>
<li class="L686" rel="L686">The Concord bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the</li>
<li class="L687" rel="L687">mail, and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from</li>
<li class="L688" rel="L688">head to foot, the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the</li>
<li class="L689" rel="L689">Royal George, that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it,</li>
<li class="L690" rel="L690">all kinds and varieties of men came out of it. Consequently, another</li>
<li class="L691" rel="L691">drawer, and two porters, and several maids and the landlady, were all</li>
<li class="L692" rel="L692">loitering by accident at various points of the road between the Concord</li>
<li class="L693" rel="L693">and the coffee-room, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed in a</li>
<li class="L694" rel="L694">brown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with large</li>
<li class="L695" rel="L695">square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets, passed along on his way to</li>
<li class="L696" rel="L696">his breakfast.</li>
<li class="L697" rel="L697"></li>
<li class="L698" rel="L698">The coffee-room had no other occupant, that forenoon, than the gentleman</li>
<li class="L699" rel="L699">in brown. His breakfast-table was drawn before the fire, and as he sat,</li>
<li class="L700" rel="L700">with its light shining on him, waiting for the meal, he sat so still,</li>
<li class="L701" rel="L701">that he might have been sitting for his portrait.</li>
<li class="L702" rel="L702"></li>
<li class="L703" rel="L703">Very orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee, and a</li>
<li class="L704" rel="L704">loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waist-coat,</li>
<li class="L705" rel="L705">as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and</li>
<li class="L706" rel="L706">evanescence of the brisk fire. He had a good leg, and was a little vain</li>
<li class="L707" rel="L707">of it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a</li>
<li class="L708" rel="L708">fine texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim. He</li>
<li class="L709" rel="L709">wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his</li>
<li class="L710" rel="L710">head: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which</li>
<li class="L711" rel="L711">looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass.</li>
<li class="L712" rel="L712">His linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings,</li>
<li class="L713" rel="L713">was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring</li>
<li class="L714" rel="L714">beach, or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea. A</li>
<li class="L715" rel="L715">face habitually suppressed and quieted, was still lighted up under the</li>
<li class="L716" rel="L716">quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost</li>
<li class="L717" rel="L717">their owner, in years gone by, some pains to drill to the composed and</li>
<li class="L718" rel="L718">reserved expression of Tellson&#39;s Bank. He had a healthy colour in his</li>
<li class="L719" rel="L719">cheeks, and his face, though lined, bore few traces of anxiety.</li>
<li class="L720" rel="L720">But, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in Tellson&#39;s Bank were</li>
<li class="L721" rel="L721">principally occupied with the cares of other people; and perhaps</li>
<li class="L722" rel="L722">second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily off and on.</li>
<li class="L723" rel="L723"></li>
<li class="L724" rel="L724">Completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait,</li>
<li class="L725" rel="L725">Mr. Lorry dropped off to sleep. The arrival of his breakfast roused him,</li>
<li class="L726" rel="L726">and he said to the drawer, as he moved his chair to it:</li>
<li class="L727" rel="L727"></li>
<li class="L728" rel="L728">“I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any</li>
<li class="L729" rel="L729">time to-day. She may ask for Mr. Jarvis Lorry, or she may only ask for a</li>
<li class="L730" rel="L730">gentleman from Tellson&#39;s Bank. Please to let me know.”</li>
<li class="L731" rel="L731"></li>
<li class="L732" rel="L732">“Yes, sir. Tellson&#39;s Bank in London, sir?”</li>
<li class="L733" rel="L733"></li>
<li class="L734" rel="L734">“Yes.”</li>
<li class="L735" rel="L735"></li>
<li class="L736" rel="L736">“Yes, sir. We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in</li>
<li class="L737" rel="L737">their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and Paris, sir. A</li>
<li class="L738" rel="L738">vast deal of travelling, sir, in Tellson and Company&#39;s House.”</li>
<li class="L739" rel="L739"></li>
<li class="L740" rel="L740">“Yes. We are quite a French House, as well as an English one.”</li>
<li class="L741" rel="L741"></li>
<li class="L742" rel="L742">“Yes, sir. Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think,</li>
<li class="L743" rel="L743">sir?”</li>
<li class="L744" rel="L744"></li>
<li class="L745" rel="L745">“Not of late years. It is fifteen years since we--since I--came last</li>
<li class="L746" rel="L746">from France.”</li>
<li class="L747" rel="L747"></li>
<li class="L748" rel="L748">“Indeed, sir? That was before my time here, sir. Before our people&#39;s</li>
<li class="L749" rel="L749">time here, sir. The George was in other hands at that time, sir.”</li>
<li class="L750" rel="L750"></li>
<li class="L751" rel="L751">“I believe so.”</li>
<li class="L752" rel="L752"></li>
<li class="L753" rel="L753">“But I would hold a pretty wager, sir, that a House like Tellson and</li>
<li class="L754" rel="L754">Company was flourishing, a matter of fifty, not to speak of fifteen</li>
<li class="L755" rel="L755">years ago?”</li>
<li class="L756" rel="L756"></li>
<li class="L757" rel="L757">“You might treble that, and say a hundred and fifty, yet not be far from</li>
<li class="L758" rel="L758">the truth.”</li>
<li class="L759" rel="L759"></li>
<li class="L760" rel="L760">“Indeed, sir!”</li>
<li class="L761" rel="L761"></li>
<li class="L762" rel="L762">Rounding his mouth and both his eyes, as he stepped backward from the</li>
<li class="L763" rel="L763">table, the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left,</li>
<li class="L764" rel="L764">dropped into a comfortable attitude, and stood surveying the guest while</li>
<li class="L765" rel="L765">he ate and drank, as from an observatory or watchtower. According to the</li>
<li class="L766" rel="L766">immemorial usage of waiters in all ages.</li>
<li class="L767" rel="L767"></li>
<li class="L768" rel="L768">When Mr. Lorry had finished his breakfast, he went out for a stroll on</li>
<li class="L769" rel="L769">the beach. The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away</li>
<li class="L770" rel="L770">from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine</li>
<li class="L771" rel="L771">ostrich. The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling</li>
<li class="L772" rel="L772">wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was</li>
<li class="L773" rel="L773">destruction. It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and</li>
<li class="L774" rel="L774">brought the coast down, madly. The air among the houses was of so strong</li>
<li class="L775" rel="L775">a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be</li>
<li class="L776" rel="L776">dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. A little</li>
<li class="L777" rel="L777">fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by</li>
<li class="L778" rel="L778">night, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide</li>
<li class="L779" rel="L779">made, and was near flood. Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever,</li>
<li class="L780" rel="L780">sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable</li>
<li class="L781" rel="L781">that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.</li>
<li class="L782" rel="L782"></li>
<li class="L783" rel="L783">As the day declined into the afternoon, and the air, which had been</li>
<li class="L784" rel="L784">at intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen, became</li>
<li class="L785" rel="L785">again charged with mist and vapour, Mr. Lorry&#39;s thoughts seemed to cloud</li>
<li class="L786" rel="L786">too. When it was dark, and he sat before the coffee-room fire, awaiting</li>
<li class="L787" rel="L787">his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast, his mind was busily digging,</li>
<li class="L788" rel="L788">digging, digging, in the live red coals.</li>
<li class="L789" rel="L789"></li>
<li class="L790" rel="L790">A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no</li>
<li class="L791" rel="L791">harm, otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work.</li>
<li class="L792" rel="L792">Mr. Lorry had been idle a long time, and had just poured out his last</li>
<li class="L793" rel="L793">glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is</li>
<li class="L794" rel="L794">ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has</li>
<li class="L795" rel="L795">got to the end of a bottle, when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow</li>
<li class="L796" rel="L796">street, and rumbled into the inn-yard.</li>
<li class="L797" rel="L797"></li>
<li class="L798" rel="L798">He set down his glass untouched. “This is Mam&#39;selle!” said he.</li>
<li class="L799" rel="L799"></li>
<li class="L800" rel="L800">In a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that Miss Manette</li>
<li class="L801" rel="L801">had arrived from London, and would be happy to see the gentleman from</li>
<li class="L802" rel="L802">Tellson&#39;s.</li>
<li class="L803" rel="L803"></li>
<li class="L804" rel="L804">“So soon?”</li>
<li class="L805" rel="L805"></li>
<li class="L806" rel="L806">Miss Manette had taken some refreshment on the road, and required none</li>
<li class="L807" rel="L807">then, and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from Tellson&#39;s</li>
<li class="L808" rel="L808">immediately, if it suited his pleasure and convenience.</li>
<li class="L809" rel="L809"></li>
<li class="L810" rel="L810">The gentleman from Tellson&#39;s had nothing left for it but to empty his</li>
<li class="L811" rel="L811">glass with an air of stolid desperation, settle his odd little flaxen</li>
<li class="L812" rel="L812">wig at the ears, and follow the waiter to Miss Manette&#39;s apartment.</li>
<li class="L813" rel="L813">It was a large, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner with black</li>
<li class="L814" rel="L814">horsehair, and loaded with heavy dark tables. These had been oiled and</li>
<li class="L815" rel="L815">oiled, until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room</li>
<li class="L816" rel="L816">were gloomily reflected on every leaf; as if _they_ were buried, in deep</li>
<li class="L817" rel="L817">graves of black mahogany, and no light to speak of could be expected</li>
<li class="L818" rel="L818">from them until they were dug out.</li>
<li class="L819" rel="L819"></li>
<li class="L820" rel="L820">The obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that Mr. Lorry, picking his</li>
<li class="L821" rel="L821">way over the well-worn Turkey carpet, supposed Miss Manette to be, for</li>
<li class="L822" rel="L822">the moment, in some adjacent room, until, having got past the two tall</li>
<li class="L823" rel="L823">candles, he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and</li>
<li class="L824" rel="L824">the fire, a young lady of not more than seventeen, in a riding-cloak,</li>
<li class="L825" rel="L825">and still holding her straw travelling-hat by its ribbon in her hand. As</li>
<li class="L826" rel="L826">his eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty figure, a quantity of golden</li>
<li class="L827" rel="L827">hair, a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look, and</li>
<li class="L828" rel="L828">a forehead with a singular capacity (remembering how young and smooth</li>
<li class="L829" rel="L829">it was), of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was</li>
<li class="L830" rel="L830">not quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm, or merely of a bright</li>
<li class="L831" rel="L831">fixed attention, though it included all the four expressions--as his</li>
<li class="L832" rel="L832">eyes rested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness passed before him,</li>
<li class="L833" rel="L833">of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very</li>
<li class="L834" rel="L834">Channel, one cold time, when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran</li>
<li class="L835" rel="L835">high. The likeness passed away, like a breath along the surface of</li>
<li class="L836" rel="L836">the gaunt pier-glass behind her, on the frame of which, a hospital</li>
<li class="L837" rel="L837">procession of negro cupids, several headless and all cripples, were</li>
<li class="L838" rel="L838">offering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities of the</li>
<li class="L839" rel="L839">feminine gender--and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette.</li>
<li class="L840" rel="L840"></li>
<li class="L841" rel="L841">“Pray take a seat, sir.” In a very clear and pleasant young voice; a</li>
<li class="L842" rel="L842">little foreign in its accent, but a very little indeed.</li>
<li class="L843" rel="L843"></li>
<li class="L844" rel="L844">“I kiss your hand, miss,” said Mr. Lorry, with the manners of an earlier</li>
<li class="L845" rel="L845">date, as he made his formal bow again, and took his seat.</li>
<li class="L846" rel="L846"></li>
<li class="L847" rel="L847">“I received a letter from the Bank, sir, yesterday, informing me that</li>
<li class="L848" rel="L848">some intelligence--or discovery--”</li>
<li class="L849" rel="L849"></li>
<li class="L850" rel="L850">“The word is not material, miss; either word will do.”</li>
<li class="L851" rel="L851"></li>
<li class="L852" rel="L852">“--respecting the small property of my poor father, whom I never saw--so</li>
<li class="L853" rel="L853">long dead--”</li>
<li class="L854" rel="L854"></li>
<li class="L855" rel="L855">Mr. Lorry moved in his chair, and cast a troubled look towards the</li>
<li class="L856" rel="L856">hospital procession of negro cupids. As if _they_ had any help for</li>
<li class="L857" rel="L857">anybody in their absurd baskets!</li>
<li class="L858" rel="L858"></li>
<li class="L859" rel="L859">“--rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris, there to communicate</li>
<li class="L860" rel="L860">with a gentleman of the Bank, so good as to be despatched to Paris for</li>
<li class="L861" rel="L861">the purpose.”</li>
<li class="L862" rel="L862"></li>
<li class="L863" rel="L863">“Myself.”</li>
<li class="L864" rel="L864"></li>
<li class="L865" rel="L865">“As I was prepared to hear, sir.”</li>
<li class="L866" rel="L866"></li>
<li class="L867" rel="L867">She curtseyed to him (young ladies made curtseys in those days), with a</li>
<li class="L868" rel="L868">pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he</li>
<li class="L869" rel="L869">was than she. He made her another bow.</li>
<li class="L870" rel="L870"></li>
<li class="L871" rel="L871">“I replied to the Bank, sir, that as it was considered necessary, by</li>
<li class="L872" rel="L872">those who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should go to</li>
<li class="L873" rel="L873">France, and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could go with</li>
<li class="L874" rel="L874">me, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place myself,</li>
<li class="L875" rel="L875">during the journey, under that worthy gentleman&#39;s protection. The</li>
<li class="L876" rel="L876">gentleman had left London, but I think a messenger was sent after him to</li>
<li class="L877" rel="L877">beg the favour of his waiting for me here.”</li>
<li class="L878" rel="L878"></li>
<li class="L879" rel="L879">“I was happy,” said Mr. Lorry, “to be entrusted with the charge. I shall</li>
<li class="L880" rel="L880">be more happy to execute it.”</li>
<li class="L881" rel="L881"></li>
<li class="L882" rel="L882">“Sir, I thank you indeed. I thank you very gratefully. It was told me</li>
<li class="L883" rel="L883">by the Bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the</li>
<li class="L884" rel="L884">business, and that I must prepare myself to find them of a surprising</li>
<li class="L885" rel="L885">nature. I have done my best to prepare myself, and I naturally have a</li>
<li class="L886" rel="L886">strong and eager interest to know what they are.”</li>
<li class="L887" rel="L887"></li>
<li class="L888" rel="L888">“Naturally,” said Mr. Lorry. “Yes--I--”</li>
<li class="L889" rel="L889"></li>
<li class="L890" rel="L890">After a pause, he added, again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the</li>
<li class="L891" rel="L891">ears, “It is very difficult to begin.”</li>
<li class="L892" rel="L892"></li>
<li class="L893" rel="L893">He did not begin, but, in his indecision, met her glance. The young</li>
<li class="L894" rel="L894">forehead lifted itself into that singular expression--but it was pretty</li>
<li class="L895" rel="L895">and characteristic, besides being singular--and she raised her hand,</li>
<li class="L896" rel="L896">as if with an involuntary action she caught at, or stayed some passing</li>
<li class="L897" rel="L897">shadow.</li>
<li class="L898" rel="L898"></li>
<li class="L899" rel="L899">“Are you quite a stranger to me, sir?”</li>
<li class="L900" rel="L900"></li>
<li class="L901" rel="L901">“Am I not?” Mr. Lorry opened his hands, and extended them outwards with</li>
<li class="L902" rel="L902">an argumentative smile.</li>
<li class="L903" rel="L903"></li>
<li class="L904" rel="L904">Between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose, the line of</li>
<li class="L905" rel="L905">which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be, the expression</li>
<li class="L906" rel="L906">deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which</li>
<li class="L907" rel="L907">she had hitherto remained standing. He watched her as she mused, and the</li>
<li class="L908" rel="L908">moment she raised her eyes again, went on:</li>
<li class="L909" rel="L909"></li>
<li class="L910" rel="L910">“In your adopted country, I presume, I cannot do better than address you</li>
<li class="L911" rel="L911">as a young English lady, Miss Manette?”</li>
<li class="L912" rel="L912"></li>
<li class="L913" rel="L913">“If you please, sir.”</li>
<li class="L914" rel="L914"></li>
<li class="L915" rel="L915">“Miss Manette, I am a man of business. I have a business charge to</li>
<li class="L916" rel="L916">acquit myself of. In your reception of it, don&#39;t heed me any more than</li>
<li class="L917" rel="L917">if I was a speaking machine--truly, I am not much else. I will, with</li>
<li class="L918" rel="L918">your leave, relate to you, miss, the story of one of our customers.”</li>
<li class="L919" rel="L919"></li>
<li class="L920" rel="L920">“Story!”</li>
<li class="L921" rel="L921"></li>
<li class="L922" rel="L922">He seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated, when he added,</li>
<li class="L923" rel="L923">in a hurry, “Yes, customers; in the banking business we usually call</li>
<li class="L924" rel="L924">our connection our customers. He was a French gentleman; a scientific</li>
<li class="L925" rel="L925">gentleman; a man of great acquirements--a Doctor.”</li>
<li class="L926" rel="L926"></li>
<li class="L927" rel="L927">“Not of Beauvais?”</li>
<li class="L928" rel="L928"></li>
<li class="L929" rel="L929">“Why, yes, of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the</li>
<li class="L930" rel="L930">gentleman was of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the</li>
<li class="L931" rel="L931">gentleman was of repute in Paris. I had the honour of knowing him there.</li>
<li class="L932" rel="L932">Our relations were business relations, but confidential. I was at that</li>
<li class="L933" rel="L933">time in our French House, and had been--oh! twenty years.”</li>
<li class="L934" rel="L934"></li>
<li class="L935" rel="L935">“At that time--I may ask, at what time, sir?”</li>
<li class="L936" rel="L936"></li>
<li class="L937" rel="L937">“I speak, miss, of twenty years ago. He married--an English lady--and</li>
<li class="L938" rel="L938">I was one of the trustees. His affairs, like the affairs of many other</li>
<li class="L939" rel="L939">French gentlemen and French families, were entirely in Tellson&#39;s hands.</li>
<li class="L940" rel="L940">In a similar way I am, or I have been, trustee of one kind or other for</li>
<li class="L941" rel="L941">scores of our customers. These are mere business relations, miss;</li>
<li class="L942" rel="L942">there is no friendship in them, no particular interest, nothing like</li>
<li class="L943" rel="L943">sentiment. I have passed from one to another, in the course of my</li>
<li class="L944" rel="L944">business life, just as I pass from one of our customers to another in</li>
<li class="L945" rel="L945">the course of my business day; in short, I have no feelings; I am a mere</li>
<li class="L946" rel="L946">machine. To go on--”</li>
<li class="L947" rel="L947"></li>
<li class="L948" rel="L948">“But this is my father&#39;s story, sir; and I begin to think”--the</li>
<li class="L949" rel="L949">curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon him--“that when I was</li>
<li class="L950" rel="L950">left an orphan through my mother&#39;s surviving my father only two years,</li>
<li class="L951" rel="L951">it was you who brought me to England. I am almost sure it was you.”</li>
<li class="L952" rel="L952"></li>
<li class="L953" rel="L953">Mr. Lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced</li>
<li class="L954" rel="L954">to take his, and he put it with some ceremony to his lips. He then</li>
<li class="L955" rel="L955">conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again, and, holding</li>
<li class="L956" rel="L956">the chair-back with his left hand, and using his right by turns to rub</li>
<li class="L957" rel="L957">his chin, pull his wig at the ears, or point what he said, stood looking</li>
<li class="L958" rel="L958">down into her face while she sat looking up into his.</li>
<li class="L959" rel="L959"></li>
<li class="L960" rel="L960">“Miss Manette, it _was_ I. And you will see how truly I spoke of myself</li>
<li class="L961" rel="L961">just now, in saying I had no feelings, and that all the relations I hold</li>
<li class="L962" rel="L962">with my fellow-creatures are mere business relations, when you reflect</li>
<li class="L963" rel="L963">that I have never seen you since. No; you have been the ward of</li>
<li class="L964" rel="L964">Tellson&#39;s House since, and I have been busy with the other business of</li>
<li class="L965" rel="L965">Tellson&#39;s House since. Feelings! I have no time for them, no chance</li>
<li class="L966" rel="L966">of them. I pass my whole life, miss, in turning an immense pecuniary</li>
<li class="L967" rel="L967">Mangle.”</li>
<li class="L968" rel="L968"></li>
<li class="L969" rel="L969">After this odd description of his daily routine of employment, Mr. Lorry</li>
<li class="L970" rel="L970">flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands (which was most</li>
<li class="L971" rel="L971">unnecessary, for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was</li>
<li class="L972" rel="L972">before), and resumed his former attitude.</li>
<li class="L973" rel="L973"></li>
<li class="L974" rel="L974">“So far, miss (as you have remarked), this is the story of your</li>
<li class="L975" rel="L975">regretted father. Now comes the difference. If your father had not died</li>
<li class="L976" rel="L976">when he did--Don&#39;t be frightened! How you start!”</li>
<li class="L977" rel="L977"></li>
<li class="L978" rel="L978">She did, indeed, start. And she caught his wrist with both her hands.</li>
<li class="L979" rel="L979"></li>
<li class="L980" rel="L980">“Pray,” said Mr. Lorry, in a soothing tone, bringing his left hand from</li>
<li class="L981" rel="L981">the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped</li>
<li class="L982" rel="L982">him in so violent a tremble: “pray control your agitation--a matter of</li>
<li class="L983" rel="L983">business. As I was saying--”</li>
<li class="L984" rel="L984"></li>
<li class="L985" rel="L985">Her look so discomposed him that he stopped, wandered, and began anew:</li>
<li class="L986" rel="L986"></li>
<li class="L987" rel="L987">“As I was saying; if Monsieur Manette had not died; if he had suddenly</li>
<li class="L988" rel="L988">and silently disappeared; if he had been spirited away; if it had not</li>
<li class="L989" rel="L989">been difficult to guess to what dreadful place, though no art could</li>
<li class="L990" rel="L990">trace him; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a</li>
<li class="L991" rel="L991">privilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid</li>
<li class="L992" rel="L992">to speak of in a whisper, across the water there; for instance, the</li>
<li class="L993" rel="L993">privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one</li>
<li class="L994" rel="L994">to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time; if his wife had</li>
<li class="L995" rel="L995">implored the king, the queen, the court, the clergy, for any tidings of</li>
<li class="L996" rel="L996">him, and all quite in vain;--then the history of your father would have</li>
<li class="L997" rel="L997">been the history of this unfortunate gentleman, the Doctor of Beauvais.”</li>
<li class="L998" rel="L998"></li>
<li class="L999" rel="L999">“I entreat you to tell me more, sir.”</li>
<li class="L1000" rel="L1000"></li>
<li class="L1001" rel="L1001">“I will. I am going to. You can bear it?”</li>
<li class="L1002" rel="L1002"></li>
<li class="L1003" rel="L1003">“I can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this</li>
<li class="L1004" rel="L1004">moment.”</li>
<li class="L1005" rel="L1005"></li>
<li class="L1006" rel="L1006">“You speak collectedly, and you--_are_ collected. That&#39;s good!” (Though</li>
<li class="L1007" rel="L1007">his manner was less satisfied than his words.) “A matter of business.</li>
<li class="L1008" rel="L1008">Regard it as a matter of business--business that must be done. Now</li>
<li class="L1009" rel="L1009">if this doctor&#39;s wife, though a lady of great courage and spirit,</li>
<li class="L1010" rel="L1010">had suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was</li>
<li class="L1011" rel="L1011">born--”</li>
<li class="L1012" rel="L1012"></li>
<li class="L1013" rel="L1013">“The little child was a daughter, sir.”</li>
<li class="L1014" rel="L1014"></li>
<li class="L1015" rel="L1015">“A daughter. A-a-matter of business--don&#39;t be distressed. Miss, if the</li>
<li class="L1016" rel="L1016">poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born,</li>
<li class="L1017" rel="L1017">that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the</li>
<li class="L1018" rel="L1018">inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of, by</li>
<li class="L1019" rel="L1019">rearing her in the belief that her father was dead--No, don&#39;t kneel! In</li>
<li class="L1020" rel="L1020">Heaven&#39;s name why should you kneel to me!”</li>
<li class="L1021" rel="L1021"></li>
<li class="L1022" rel="L1022">“For the truth. O dear, good, compassionate sir, for the truth!”</li>
<li class="L1023" rel="L1023"></li>
<li class="L1024" rel="L1024">“A--a matter of business. You confuse me, and how can I transact</li>
<li class="L1025" rel="L1025">business if I am confused? Let us be clear-headed. If you could kindly</li>
<li class="L1026" rel="L1026">mention now, for instance, what nine times ninepence are, or how many</li>
<li class="L1027" rel="L1027">shillings in twenty guineas, it would be so encouraging. I should be so</li>
<li class="L1028" rel="L1028">much more at my ease about your state of mind.”</li>
<li class="L1029" rel="L1029"></li>
<li class="L1030" rel="L1030">Without directly answering to this appeal, she sat so still when he had</li>
<li class="L1031" rel="L1031">very gently raised her, and the hands that had not ceased to clasp</li>
<li class="L1032" rel="L1032">his wrists were so much more steady than they had been, that she</li>
<li class="L1033" rel="L1033">communicated some reassurance to Mr. Jarvis Lorry.</li>
<li class="L1034" rel="L1034"></li>
<li class="L1035" rel="L1035">“That&#39;s right, that&#39;s right. Courage! Business! You have business before</li>
<li class="L1036" rel="L1036">you; useful business. Miss Manette, your mother took this course with</li>
<li class="L1037" rel="L1037">you. And when she died--I believe broken-hearted--having never slackened</li>
<li class="L1038" rel="L1038">her unavailing search for your father, she left you, at two years old,</li>
<li class="L1039" rel="L1039">to grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy, without the dark cloud</li>
<li class="L1040" rel="L1040">upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his</li>
<li class="L1041" rel="L1041">heart out in prison, or wasted there through many lingering years.”</li>
<li class="L1042" rel="L1042"></li>
<li class="L1043" rel="L1043">As he said the words he looked down, with an admiring pity, on the</li>
<li class="L1044" rel="L1044">flowing golden hair; as if he pictured to himself that it might have</li>
<li class="L1045" rel="L1045">been already tinged with grey.</li>
<li class="L1046" rel="L1046"></li>
<li class="L1047" rel="L1047">“You know that your parents had no great possession, and that what</li>
<li class="L1048" rel="L1048">they had was secured to your mother and to you. There has been no new</li>
<li class="L1049" rel="L1049">discovery, of money, or of any other property; but--”</li>
<li class="L1050" rel="L1050"></li>
<li class="L1051" rel="L1051">He felt his wrist held closer, and he stopped. The expression in the</li>
<li class="L1052" rel="L1052">forehead, which had so particularly attracted his notice, and which was</li>
<li class="L1053" rel="L1053">now immovable, had deepened into one of pain and horror.</li>
<li class="L1054" rel="L1054"></li>
<li class="L1055" rel="L1055">“But he has been--been found. He is alive. Greatly changed, it is too</li>
<li class="L1056" rel="L1056">probable; almost a wreck, it is possible; though we will hope the best.</li>
<li class="L1057" rel="L1057">Still, alive. Your father has been taken to the house of an old servant</li>
<li class="L1058" rel="L1058">in Paris, and we are going there: I, to identify him if I can: you, to</li>
<li class="L1059" rel="L1059">restore him to life, love, duty, rest, comfort.”</li>
<li class="L1060" rel="L1060"></li>
<li class="L1061" rel="L1061">A shiver ran through her frame, and from it through his. She said, in a</li>
<li class="L1062" rel="L1062">low, distinct, awe-stricken voice, as if she were saying it in a dream,</li>
<li class="L1063" rel="L1063"></li>
<li class="L1064" rel="L1064">“I am going to see his Ghost! It will be his Ghost--not him!”</li>
<li class="L1065" rel="L1065"></li>
<li class="L1066" rel="L1066">Mr. Lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm. “There, there,</li>
<li class="L1067" rel="L1067">there! See now, see now! The best and the worst are known to you, now.</li>
<li class="L1068" rel="L1068">You are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman, and, with a fair</li>
<li class="L1069" rel="L1069">sea voyage, and a fair land journey, you will be soon at his dear side.”</li>
<li class="L1070" rel="L1070"></li>
<li class="L1071" rel="L1071">She repeated in the same tone, sunk to a whisper, “I have been free, I</li>
<li class="L1072" rel="L1072">have been happy, yet his Ghost has never haunted me!”</li>
<li class="L1073" rel="L1073"></li>
<li class="L1074" rel="L1074">“Only one thing more,” said Mr. Lorry, laying stress upon it as a</li>
<li class="L1075" rel="L1075">wholesome means of enforcing her attention: “he has been found under</li>
<li class="L1076" rel="L1076">another name; his own, long forgotten or long concealed. It would be</li>
<li class="L1077" rel="L1077">worse than useless now to inquire which; worse than useless to seek to</li>
<li class="L1078" rel="L1078">know whether he has been for years overlooked, or always designedly</li>
<li class="L1079" rel="L1079">held prisoner. It would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries,</li>
<li class="L1080" rel="L1080">because it would be dangerous. Better not to mention the subject,</li>
<li class="L1081" rel="L1081">anywhere or in any way, and to remove him--for a while at all</li>
<li class="L1082" rel="L1082">events--out of France. Even I, safe as an Englishman, and even</li>
<li class="L1083" rel="L1083">Tellson&#39;s, important as they are to French credit, avoid all naming of</li>
<li class="L1084" rel="L1084">the matter. I carry about me, not a scrap of writing openly referring</li>
<li class="L1085" rel="L1085">to it. This is a secret service altogether. My credentials, entries,</li>
<li class="L1086" rel="L1086">and memoranda, are all comprehended in the one line, &#39;Recalled to Life;&#39;</li>
<li class="L1087" rel="L1087">which may mean anything. But what is the matter! She doesn&#39;t notice a</li>
<li class="L1088" rel="L1088">word! Miss Manette!”</li>
<li class="L1089" rel="L1089"></li>
<li class="L1090" rel="L1090">Perfectly still and silent, and not even fallen back in her chair, she</li>
<li class="L1091" rel="L1091">sat under his hand, utterly insensible; with her eyes open and fixed</li>
<li class="L1092" rel="L1092">upon him, and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or</li>
<li class="L1093" rel="L1093">branded into her forehead. So close was her hold upon his arm, that he</li>
<li class="L1094" rel="L1094">feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her; therefore he called</li>
<li class="L1095" rel="L1095">out loudly for assistance without moving.</li>
<li class="L1096" rel="L1096"></li>
<li class="L1097" rel="L1097">A wild-looking woman, whom even in his agitation, Mr. Lorry observed to</li>
<li class="L1098" rel="L1098">be all of a red colour, and to have red hair, and to be dressed in some</li>
<li class="L1099" rel="L1099">extraordinary tight-fitting fashion, and to have on her head a most</li>
<li class="L1100" rel="L1100">wonderful bonnet like a Grenadier wooden measure, and good measure too,</li>
<li class="L1101" rel="L1101">or a great Stilton cheese, came running into the room in advance of the</li>
<li class="L1102" rel="L1102">inn servants, and soon settled the question of his detachment from the</li>
<li class="L1103" rel="L1103">poor young lady, by laying a brawny hand upon his chest, and sending him</li>
<li class="L1104" rel="L1104">flying back against the nearest wall.</li>
<li class="L1105" rel="L1105"></li>
<li class="L1106" rel="L1106">(“I really think this must be a man!” was Mr. Lorry&#39;s breathless</li>
<li class="L1107" rel="L1107">reflection, simultaneously with his coming against the wall.)</li>
<li class="L1108" rel="L1108"></li>
<li class="L1109" rel="L1109">“Why, look at you all!” bawled this figure, addressing the inn servants.</li>
<li class="L1110" rel="L1110">“Why don&#39;t you go and fetch things, instead of standing there staring</li>
<li class="L1111" rel="L1111">at me? I am not so much to look at, am I? Why don&#39;t you go and fetch</li>
<li class="L1112" rel="L1112">things? I&#39;ll let you know, if you don&#39;t bring smelling-salts, cold</li>
<li class="L1113" rel="L1113">water, and vinegar, quick, I will.”</li>
<li class="L1114" rel="L1114"></li>
<li class="L1115" rel="L1115">There was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives, and she</li>
<li class="L1116" rel="L1116">softly laid the patient on a sofa, and tended her with great skill and</li>
<li class="L1117" rel="L1117">gentleness: calling her “my precious!” and “my bird!” and spreading her</li>
<li class="L1118" rel="L1118">golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care.</li>
<li class="L1119" rel="L1119"></li>
<li class="L1120" rel="L1120">“And you in brown!” she said, indignantly turning to Mr. Lorry;</li>
<li class="L1121" rel="L1121">“couldn&#39;t you tell her what you had to tell her, without frightening her</li>
<li class="L1122" rel="L1122">to death? Look at her, with her pretty pale face and her cold hands. Do</li>
<li class="L1123" rel="L1123">you call _that_ being a Banker?”</li>
<li class="L1124" rel="L1124"></li>
<li class="L1125" rel="L1125">Mr. Lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to</li>
<li class="L1126" rel="L1126">answer, that he could only look on, at a distance, with much feebler</li>
<li class="L1127" rel="L1127">sympathy and humility, while the strong woman, having banished the inn</li>
<li class="L1128" rel="L1128">servants under the mysterious penalty of “letting them know” something</li>
<li class="L1129" rel="L1129">not mentioned if they stayed there, staring, recovered her charge by a</li>
<li class="L1130" rel="L1130">regular series of gradations, and coaxed her to lay her drooping head</li>
<li class="L1131" rel="L1131">upon her shoulder.</li>
<li class="L1132" rel="L1132"></li>
<li class="L1133" rel="L1133">“I hope she will do well now,” said Mr. Lorry.</li>
<li class="L1134" rel="L1134"></li>
<li class="L1135" rel="L1135">“No thanks to you in brown, if she does. My darling pretty!”</li>
<li class="L1136" rel="L1136"></li>
<li class="L1137" rel="L1137">“I hope,” said Mr. Lorry, after another pause of feeble sympathy and</li>
<li class="L1138" rel="L1138">humility, “that you accompany Miss Manette to France?”</li>
<li class="L1139" rel="L1139"></li>
<li class="L1140" rel="L1140">“A likely thing, too!” replied the strong woman. “If it was ever</li>
<li class="L1141" rel="L1141">intended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose Providence</li>
<li class="L1142" rel="L1142">would have cast my lot in an island?”</li>
<li class="L1143" rel="L1143"></li>
<li class="L1144" rel="L1144">This being another question hard to answer, Mr. Jarvis Lorry withdrew to</li>
<li class="L1145" rel="L1145">consider it.</li>
<li class="L1146" rel="L1146"></li>
<li class="L1147" rel="L1147"></li>
<li class="L1148" rel="L1148"></li>
<li class="L1149" rel="L1149"></li>
<li class="L1150" rel="L1150">V. The Wine-shop</li>
<li class="L1151" rel="L1151"></li>
<li class="L1152" rel="L1152"></li>
<li class="L1153" rel="L1153">A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. The</li>
<li class="L1154" rel="L1154">accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled</li>
<li class="L1155" rel="L1155">out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just</li>
<li class="L1156" rel="L1156">outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.</li>
<li class="L1157" rel="L1157"></li>
<li class="L1158" rel="L1158">All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their</li>
<li class="L1159" rel="L1159">idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular</li>
<li class="L1160" rel="L1160">stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have</li>
<li class="L1161" rel="L1161">thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them,</li>
<li class="L1162" rel="L1162">had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own</li>
<li class="L1163" rel="L1163">jostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down,</li>
<li class="L1164" rel="L1164">made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help</li>
<li class="L1165" rel="L1165">women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all</li>
<li class="L1166" rel="L1166">run out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in</li>
<li class="L1167" rel="L1167">the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with</li>
<li class="L1168" rel="L1168">handkerchiefs from women&#39;s heads, which were squeezed dry into infants&#39;</li>
<li class="L1169" rel="L1169">mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran;</li>
<li class="L1170" rel="L1170">others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and</li>
<li class="L1171" rel="L1171">there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new</li>
<li class="L1172" rel="L1172">directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed</li>
<li class="L1173" rel="L1173">pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted</li>
<li class="L1174" rel="L1174">fragments with eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the</li>
<li class="L1175" rel="L1175">wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up</li>
<li class="L1176" rel="L1176">along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street,</li>
<li class="L1177" rel="L1177">if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous</li>
<li class="L1178" rel="L1178">presence.</li>
<li class="L1179" rel="L1179"></li>
<li class="L1180" rel="L1180">A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices--voices of men, women,</li>
<li class="L1181" rel="L1181">and children--resounded in the street while this wine game lasted. There</li>
<li class="L1182" rel="L1182">was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness. There was a</li>
<li class="L1183" rel="L1183">special companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part</li>
<li class="L1184" rel="L1184">of every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the</li>
<li class="L1185" rel="L1185">luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths,</li>
<li class="L1186" rel="L1186">shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen</li>
<li class="L1187" rel="L1187">together. When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been</li>
<li class="L1188" rel="L1188">most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these</li>
<li class="L1189" rel="L1189">demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out. The man who</li>
<li class="L1190" rel="L1190">had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting, set it in</li>
<li class="L1191" rel="L1191">motion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of</li>
<li class="L1192" rel="L1192">hot ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own</li>
<li class="L1193" rel="L1193">starved fingers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men</li>
<li class="L1194" rel="L1194">with bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged into</li>
<li class="L1195" rel="L1195">the winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and a gloom</li>
<li class="L1196" rel="L1196">gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine.</li>
<li class="L1197" rel="L1197"></li>
<li class="L1198" rel="L1198">The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street</li>
<li class="L1199" rel="L1199">in the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled. It had</li>
<li class="L1200" rel="L1200">stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many</li>
<li class="L1201" rel="L1201">wooden shoes. The hands of the man who sawed the wood, left red marks</li>
<li class="L1202" rel="L1202">on the billets; and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby, was</li>
<li class="L1203" rel="L1203">stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again.</li>
<li class="L1204" rel="L1204">Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask, had acquired a</li>
<li class="L1205" rel="L1205">tigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so besmirched, his</li>
<li class="L1206" rel="L1206">head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it, scrawled</li>
<li class="L1207" rel="L1207">upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees--BLOOD.</li>
<li class="L1208" rel="L1208"></li>
<li class="L1209" rel="L1209">The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the</li>
<li class="L1210" rel="L1210">street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.</li>
<li class="L1211" rel="L1211"></li>
<li class="L1212" rel="L1212">And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary</li>
<li class="L1213" rel="L1213">gleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it was</li>
<li class="L1214" rel="L1214">heavy--cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in</li>
<li class="L1215" rel="L1215">waiting on the saintly presence--nobles of great power all of them;</li>
<li class="L1216" rel="L1216">but, most especially the last. Samples of a people that had undergone a</li>
<li class="L1217" rel="L1217">terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the</li>
<li class="L1218" rel="L1218">fabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner,</li>
<li class="L1219" rel="L1219">passed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered</li>
<li class="L1220" rel="L1220">in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook. The mill which</li>
<li class="L1221" rel="L1221">had worked them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the</li>
<li class="L1222" rel="L1222">children had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the</li>
<li class="L1223" rel="L1223">grown faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh,</li>
<li class="L1224" rel="L1224">was the sigh, Hunger. It was prevalent everywhere. Hunger was pushed out</li>
<li class="L1225" rel="L1225">of the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and</li>
<li class="L1226" rel="L1226">lines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and</li>
<li class="L1227" rel="L1227">paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of</li>
<li class="L1228" rel="L1228">firewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the smokeless</li>
<li class="L1229" rel="L1229">chimneys, and started up from the filthy street that had no offal,</li>
<li class="L1230" rel="L1230">among its refuse, of anything to eat. Hunger was the inscription on the</li>
<li class="L1231" rel="L1231">baker&#39;s shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of</li>
<li class="L1232" rel="L1232">bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that</li>
<li class="L1233" rel="L1233">was offered for sale. Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting</li>
<li class="L1234" rel="L1234">chestnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomics in every</li>
<li class="L1235" rel="L1235">farthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant</li>
<li class="L1236" rel="L1236">drops of oil.</li>
<li class="L1237" rel="L1237"></li>
<li class="L1238" rel="L1238">Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it. A narrow winding</li>
<li class="L1239" rel="L1239">street, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets</li>
<li class="L1240" rel="L1240">diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags</li>
<li class="L1241" rel="L1241">and nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them</li>
<li class="L1242" rel="L1242">that looked ill. In the hunted air of the people there was yet some</li>
<li class="L1243" rel="L1243">wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay. Depressed and</li>
<li class="L1244" rel="L1244">slinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them; nor</li>
<li class="L1245" rel="L1245">compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads knitted</li>
<li class="L1246" rel="L1246">into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or</li>
<li class="L1247" rel="L1247">inflicting. The trade signs (and they were almost as many as the shops)</li>
<li class="L1248" rel="L1248">were, all, grim illustrations of Want. The butcher and the porkman</li>
<li class="L1249" rel="L1249">painted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest of</li>
<li class="L1250" rel="L1250">meagre loaves. The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops,</li>
<li class="L1251" rel="L1251">croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and were</li>
<li class="L1252" rel="L1252">gloweringly confidential together. Nothing was represented in a</li>
<li class="L1253" rel="L1253">flourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler&#39;s knives</li>
<li class="L1254" rel="L1254">and axes were sharp and bright, the smith&#39;s hammers were heavy, and the</li>
<li class="L1255" rel="L1255">gunmaker&#39;s stock was murderous. The crippling stones of the pavement,</li>
<li class="L1256" rel="L1256">with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but</li>
<li class="L1257" rel="L1257">broke off abruptly at the doors. The kennel, to make amends, ran down</li>
<li class="L1258" rel="L1258">the middle of the street--when it ran at all: which was only after heavy</li>
<li class="L1259" rel="L1259">rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses. Across</li>
<li class="L1260" rel="L1260">the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and</li>
<li class="L1261" rel="L1261">pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted,</li>
<li class="L1262" rel="L1262">and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly</li>
<li class="L1263" rel="L1263">manner overhead, as if they were at sea. Indeed they were at sea, and</li>
<li class="L1264" rel="L1264">the ship and crew were in peril of tempest.</li>
<li class="L1265" rel="L1265"></li>
<li class="L1266" rel="L1266">For, the time was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region</li>
<li class="L1267" rel="L1267">should have watched the lamplighter, in their idleness and hunger, so</li>
<li class="L1268" rel="L1268">long, as to conceive the idea of improving on his method, and hauling</li>
<li class="L1269" rel="L1269">up men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their</li>
<li class="L1270" rel="L1270">condition. But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew over</li>
<li class="L1271" rel="L1271">France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine of</li>
<li class="L1272" rel="L1272">song and feather, took no warning.</li>
<li class="L1273" rel="L1273"></li>
<li class="L1274" rel="L1274">The wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its</li>
<li class="L1275" rel="L1275">appearance and degree, and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside</li>
<li class="L1276" rel="L1276">it, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at the struggle</li>
<li class="L1277" rel="L1277">for the lost wine. “It&#39;s not my affair,” said he, with a final shrug</li>
<li class="L1278" rel="L1278">of the shoulders. “The people from the market did it. Let them bring</li>
<li class="L1279" rel="L1279">another.”</li>
<li class="L1280" rel="L1280"></li>
<li class="L1281" rel="L1281">There, his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke,</li>
<li class="L1282" rel="L1282">he called to him across the way:</li>
<li class="L1283" rel="L1283"></li>
<li class="L1284" rel="L1284">“Say, then, my Gaspard, what do you do there?”</li>
<li class="L1285" rel="L1285"></li>
<li class="L1286" rel="L1286">The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance, as is often</li>
<li class="L1287" rel="L1287">the way with his tribe. It missed its mark, and completely failed, as is</li>
<li class="L1288" rel="L1288">often the way with his tribe too.</li>
<li class="L1289" rel="L1289"></li>
<li class="L1290" rel="L1290">“What now? Are you a subject for the mad hospital?” said the wine-shop</li>
<li class="L1291" rel="L1291">keeper, crossing the road, and obliterating the jest with a handful of</li>
<li class="L1292" rel="L1292">mud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it. “Why do you write</li>
<li class="L1293" rel="L1293">in the public streets? Is there--tell me thou--is there no other place</li>
<li class="L1294" rel="L1294">to write such words in?”</li>
<li class="L1295" rel="L1295"></li>
<li class="L1296" rel="L1296">In his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand (perhaps accidentally,</li>
<li class="L1297" rel="L1297">perhaps not) upon the joker&#39;s heart. The joker rapped it with his</li>
<li class="L1298" rel="L1298">own, took a nimble spring upward, and came down in a fantastic dancing</li>
<li class="L1299" rel="L1299">attitude, with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his</li>
<li class="L1300" rel="L1300">hand, and held out. A joker of an extremely, not to say wolfishly</li>
<li class="L1301" rel="L1301">practical character, he looked, under those circumstances.</li>
<li class="L1302" rel="L1302"></li>
<li class="L1303" rel="L1303">“Put it on, put it on,” said the other. “Call wine, wine; and finish</li>
<li class="L1304" rel="L1304">there.” With that advice, he wiped his soiled hand upon the joker&#39;s</li>
<li class="L1305" rel="L1305">dress, such as it was--quite deliberately, as having dirtied the hand on</li>
<li class="L1306" rel="L1306">his account; and then recrossed the road and entered the wine-shop.</li>
<li class="L1307" rel="L1307"></li>
<li class="L1308" rel="L1308">This wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked, martial-looking man of thirty,</li>
<li class="L1309" rel="L1309">and he should have been of a hot temperament, for, although it was a</li>
<li class="L1310" rel="L1310">bitter day, he wore no coat, but carried one slung over his shoulder.</li>
<li class="L1311" rel="L1311">His shirt-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his brown arms were bare to</li>
<li class="L1312" rel="L1312">the elbows. Neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own</li>
<li class="L1313" rel="L1313">crisply-curling short dark hair. He was a dark man altogether, with good</li>
<li class="L1314" rel="L1314">eyes and a good bold breadth between them. Good-humoured looking on</li>
<li class="L1315" rel="L1315">the whole, but implacable-looking, too; evidently a man of a strong</li>
<li class="L1316" rel="L1316">resolution and a set purpose; a man not desirable to be met, rushing</li>
<li class="L1317" rel="L1317">down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side, for nothing would turn</li>
<li class="L1318" rel="L1318">the man.</li>
<li class="L1319" rel="L1319"></li>
<li class="L1320" rel="L1320">Madame Defarge, his wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he</li>
<li class="L1321" rel="L1321">came in. Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own age, with</li>
<li class="L1322" rel="L1322">a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large hand</li>
<li class="L1323" rel="L1323">heavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure of</li>
<li class="L1324" rel="L1324">manner. There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which one might</li>
<li class="L1325" rel="L1325">have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself</li>
<li class="L1326" rel="L1326">in any of the reckonings over which she presided. Madame Defarge being</li>
<li class="L1327" rel="L1327">sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright</li>
<li class="L1328" rel="L1328">shawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment of her large</li>
<li class="L1329" rel="L1329">earrings. Her knitting was before her, but she had laid it down to pick</li>
<li class="L1330" rel="L1330">her teeth with a toothpick. Thus engaged, with her right elbow supported</li>
<li class="L1331" rel="L1331">by her left hand, Madame Defarge said nothing when her lord came in, but</li>
<li class="L1332" rel="L1332">coughed just one grain of cough. This, in combination with the lifting</li>
<li class="L1333" rel="L1333">of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a</li>
<li class="L1334" rel="L1334">line, suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the</li>
<li class="L1335" rel="L1335">shop among the customers, for any new customer who had dropped in while</li>
<li class="L1336" rel="L1336">he stepped over the way.</li>
<li class="L1337" rel="L1337"></li>
<li class="L1338" rel="L1338">The wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about, until they</li>
<li class="L1339" rel="L1339">rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady, who were seated in</li>
<li class="L1340" rel="L1340">a corner. Other company were there: two playing cards, two playing</li>
<li class="L1341" rel="L1341">dominoes, three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply</li>
<li class="L1342" rel="L1342">of wine. As he passed behind the counter, he took notice that the</li>
<li class="L1343" rel="L1343">elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady, “This is our man.”</li>
<li class="L1344" rel="L1344"></li>
<li class="L1345" rel="L1345">“What the devil do _you_ do in that galley there?” said Monsieur Defarge</li>
<li class="L1346" rel="L1346">to himself; “I don&#39;t know you.”</li>
<li class="L1347" rel="L1347"></li>
<li class="L1348" rel="L1348">But, he feigned not to notice the two strangers, and fell into discourse</li>
<li class="L1349" rel="L1349">with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter.</li>
<li class="L1350" rel="L1350"></li>
<li class="L1351" rel="L1351">“How goes it, Jacques?” said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge. “Is</li>
<li class="L1352" rel="L1352">all the spilt wine swallowed?”</li>
<li class="L1353" rel="L1353"></li>
<li class="L1354" rel="L1354">“Every drop, Jacques,” answered Monsieur Defarge.</li>
<li class="L1355" rel="L1355"></li>
<li class="L1356" rel="L1356">When this interchange of Christian name was effected, Madame Defarge,</li>
<li class="L1357" rel="L1357">picking her teeth with her toothpick, coughed another grain of cough,</li>
<li class="L1358" rel="L1358">and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.</li>
<li class="L1359" rel="L1359"></li>
<li class="L1360" rel="L1360">“It is not often,” said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur</li>
<li class="L1361" rel="L1361">Defarge, “that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine, or</li>
<li class="L1362" rel="L1362">of anything but black bread and death. Is it not so, Jacques?”</li>
<li class="L1363" rel="L1363"></li>
<li class="L1364" rel="L1364">“It is so, Jacques,” Monsieur Defarge returned.</li>
<li class="L1365" rel="L1365"></li>
<li class="L1366" rel="L1366">At this second interchange of the Christian name, Madame Defarge, still</li>
<li class="L1367" rel="L1367">using her toothpick with profound composure, coughed another grain of</li>
<li class="L1368" rel="L1368">cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.</li>
<li class="L1369" rel="L1369"></li>
<li class="L1370" rel="L1370">The last of the three now said his say, as he put down his empty</li>
<li class="L1371" rel="L1371">drinking vessel and smacked his lips.</li>
<li class="L1372" rel="L1372"></li>
<li class="L1373" rel="L1373">“Ah! So much the worse! A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle</li>
<li class="L1374" rel="L1374">always have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, Jacques. Am I</li>
<li class="L1375" rel="L1375">right, Jacques?”</li>
<li class="L1376" rel="L1376"></li>
<li class="L1377" rel="L1377">“You are right, Jacques,” was the response of Monsieur Defarge.</li>
<li class="L1378" rel="L1378"></li>
<li class="L1379" rel="L1379">This third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the moment</li>
<li class="L1380" rel="L1380">when Madame Defarge put her toothpick by, kept her eyebrows up, and</li>
<li class="L1381" rel="L1381">slightly rustled in her seat.</li>
<li class="L1382" rel="L1382"></li>
<li class="L1383" rel="L1383">“Hold then! True!” muttered her husband. “Gentlemen--my wife!”</li>
<li class="L1384" rel="L1384"></li>
<li class="L1385" rel="L1385">The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with three</li>
<li class="L1386" rel="L1386">flourishes. She acknowledged their homage by bending her head, and</li>
<li class="L1387" rel="L1387">giving them a quick look. Then she glanced in a casual manner round the</li>
<li class="L1388" rel="L1388">wine-shop, took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose</li>
<li class="L1389" rel="L1389">of spirit, and became absorbed in it.</li>
<li class="L1390" rel="L1390"></li>
<li class="L1391" rel="L1391">“Gentlemen,” said her husband, who had kept his bright eye observantly</li>
<li class="L1392" rel="L1392">upon her, “good day. The chamber, furnished bachelor-fashion, that you</li>
<li class="L1393" rel="L1393">wished to see, and were inquiring for when I stepped out, is on the</li>
<li class="L1394" rel="L1394">fifth floor. The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard</li>
<li class="L1395" rel="L1395">close to the left here,” pointing with his hand, “near to the window of</li>
<li class="L1396" rel="L1396">my establishment. But, now that I remember, one of you has already been</li>
<li class="L1397" rel="L1397">there, and can show the way. Gentlemen, adieu!”</li>
<li class="L1398" rel="L1398"></li>
<li class="L1399" rel="L1399">They paid for their wine, and left the place. The eyes of Monsieur</li>
<li class="L1400" rel="L1400">Defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly</li>
<li class="L1401" rel="L1401">gentleman advanced from his corner, and begged the favour of a word.</li>
<li class="L1402" rel="L1402"></li>
<li class="L1403" rel="L1403">“Willingly, sir,” said Monsieur Defarge, and quietly stepped with him to</li>
<li class="L1404" rel="L1404">the door.</li>
<li class="L1405" rel="L1405"></li>
<li class="L1406" rel="L1406">Their conference was very short, but very decided. Almost at the first</li>
<li class="L1407" rel="L1407">word, Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive. It had</li>
<li class="L1408" rel="L1408">not lasted a minute, when he nodded and went out. The gentleman then</li>
<li class="L1409" rel="L1409">beckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out. Madame Defarge</li>
<li class="L1410" rel="L1410">knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing.</li>
<li class="L1411" rel="L1411"></li>
<li class="L1412" rel="L1412">Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette, emerging from the wine-shop thus,</li>
<li class="L1413" rel="L1413">joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own</li>
<li class="L1414" rel="L1414">company just before. It opened from a stinking little black courtyard,</li>
<li class="L1415" rel="L1415">and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited</li>
<li class="L1416" rel="L1416">by a great number of people. In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the</li>
<li class="L1417" rel="L1417">gloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee</li>
<li class="L1418" rel="L1418">to the child of his old master, and put her hand to his lips. It was</li>
<li class="L1419" rel="L1419">a gentle action, but not at all gently done; a very remarkable</li>
<li class="L1420" rel="L1420">transformation had come over him in a few seconds. He had no good-humour</li>
<li class="L1421" rel="L1421">in his face, nor any openness of aspect left, but had become a secret,</li>
<li class="L1422" rel="L1422">angry, dangerous man.</li>
<li class="L1423" rel="L1423"></li>
<li class="L1424" rel="L1424">“It is very high; it is a little difficult. Better to begin slowly.”</li>
<li class="L1425" rel="L1425"> Thus, Monsieur Defarge, in a stern voice, to Mr. Lorry, as they began</li>
<li class="L1426" rel="L1426">ascending the stairs.</li>
<li class="L1427" rel="L1427"></li>
<li class="L1428" rel="L1428">“Is he alone?” the latter whispered.</li>
<li class="L1429" rel="L1429"></li>
<li class="L1430" rel="L1430">“Alone! God help him, who should be with him!” said the other, in the</li>
<li class="L1431" rel="L1431">same low voice.</li>
<li class="L1432" rel="L1432"></li>
<li class="L1433" rel="L1433">“Is he always alone, then?”</li>
<li class="L1434" rel="L1434"></li>
<li class="L1435" rel="L1435">“Yes.”</li>
<li class="L1436" rel="L1436"></li>
<li class="L1437" rel="L1437">“Of his own desire?”</li>
<li class="L1438" rel="L1438"></li>
<li class="L1439" rel="L1439">“Of his own necessity. As he was, when I first saw him after they</li>
<li class="L1440" rel="L1440">found me and demanded to know if I would take him, and, at my peril be</li>
<li class="L1441" rel="L1441">discreet--as he was then, so he is now.”</li>
<li class="L1442" rel="L1442"></li>
<li class="L1443" rel="L1443">“He is greatly changed?”</li>
<li class="L1444" rel="L1444"></li>
<li class="L1445" rel="L1445">“Changed!”</li>
<li class="L1446" rel="L1446"></li>
<li class="L1447" rel="L1447">The keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand,</li>
<li class="L1448" rel="L1448">and mutter a tremendous curse. No direct answer could have been half so</li>
<li class="L1449" rel="L1449">forcible. Mr. Lorry&#39;s spirits grew heavier and heavier, as he and his</li>
<li class="L1450" rel="L1450">two companions ascended higher and higher.</li>
<li class="L1451" rel="L1451"></li>
<li class="L1452" rel="L1452">Such a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded</li>
<li class="L1453" rel="L1453">parts of Paris, would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it was vile</li>
<li class="L1454" rel="L1454">indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses. Every little habitation</li>
<li class="L1455" rel="L1455">within the great foul nest of one high building--that is to say,</li>
<li class="L1456" rel="L1456">the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general</li>
<li class="L1457" rel="L1457">staircase--left its own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides</li>
<li class="L1458" rel="L1458">flinging other refuse from its own windows. The uncontrollable and</li>
<li class="L1459" rel="L1459">hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted</li>
<li class="L1460" rel="L1460">the air, even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their</li>
<li class="L1461" rel="L1461">intangible impurities; the two bad sources combined made it almost</li>
<li class="L1462" rel="L1462">insupportable. Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt</li>
<li class="L1463" rel="L1463">and poison, the way lay. Yielding to his own disturbance of mind, and to</li>
<li class="L1464" rel="L1464">his young companion&#39;s agitation, which became greater every instant, Mr.</li>
<li class="L1465" rel="L1465">Jarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest. Each of these stoppages was made</li>
<li class="L1466" rel="L1466">at a doleful grating, by which any languishing good airs that were left</li>
<li class="L1467" rel="L1467">uncorrupted, seemed to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed</li>
<li class="L1468" rel="L1468">to crawl in. Through the rusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were</li>
<li class="L1469" rel="L1469">caught of the jumbled neighbourhood; and nothing within range, nearer</li>
<li class="L1470" rel="L1470">or lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame, had any</li>
<li class="L1471" rel="L1471">promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations.</li>
<li class="L1472" rel="L1472"></li>
<li class="L1473" rel="L1473">At last, the top of the staircase was gained, and they stopped for the</li>
<li class="L1474" rel="L1474">third time. There was yet an upper staircase, of a steeper inclination</li>
<li class="L1475" rel="L1475">and of contracted dimensions, to be ascended, before the garret story</li>
<li class="L1476" rel="L1476">was reached. The keeper of the wine-shop, always going a little in</li>
<li class="L1477" rel="L1477">advance, and always going on the side which Mr. Lorry took, as though he</li>
<li class="L1478" rel="L1478">dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady, turned himself about</li>
<li class="L1479" rel="L1479">here, and, carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over</li>
<li class="L1480" rel="L1480">his shoulder, took out a key.</li>
<li class="L1481" rel="L1481"></li>
<li class="L1482" rel="L1482">“The door is locked then, my friend?” said Mr. Lorry, surprised.</li>
<li class="L1483" rel="L1483"></li>
<li class="L1484" rel="L1484">“Ay. Yes,” was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge.</li>
<li class="L1485" rel="L1485"></li>
<li class="L1486" rel="L1486">“You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?”</li>
<li class="L1487" rel="L1487"></li>
<li class="L1488" rel="L1488">“I think it necessary to turn the key.” Monsieur Defarge whispered it</li>
<li class="L1489" rel="L1489">closer in his ear, and frowned heavily.</li>
<li class="L1490" rel="L1490"></li>
<li class="L1491" rel="L1491">“Why?”</li>
<li class="L1492" rel="L1492"></li>
<li class="L1493" rel="L1493">“Why! Because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would be</li>
<li class="L1494" rel="L1494">frightened--rave--tear himself to pieces--die--come to I know not what</li>
<li class="L1495" rel="L1495">harm--if his door was left open.”</li>
<li class="L1496" rel="L1496"></li>
<li class="L1497" rel="L1497">“Is it possible!” exclaimed Mr. Lorry.</li>
<li class="L1498" rel="L1498"></li>
<li class="L1499" rel="L1499">“Is it possible!” repeated Defarge, bitterly. “Yes. And a beautiful</li>
<li class="L1500" rel="L1500">world we live in, when it _is_ possible, and when many other such things</li>
<li class="L1501" rel="L1501">are possible, and not only possible, but done--done, see you!--under</li>
<li class="L1502" rel="L1502">that sky there, every day. Long live the Devil. Let us go on.”</li>
<li class="L1503" rel="L1503"></li>
<li class="L1504" rel="L1504">This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a word</li>
<li class="L1505" rel="L1505">of it had reached the young lady&#39;s ears. But, by this time she trembled</li>
<li class="L1506" rel="L1506">under such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep anxiety,</li>
<li class="L1507" rel="L1507">and, above all, such dread and terror, that Mr. Lorry felt it incumbent</li>
<li class="L1508" rel="L1508">on him to speak a word or two of reassurance.</li>
<li class="L1509" rel="L1509"></li>
<li class="L1510" rel="L1510">“Courage, dear miss! Courage! Business! The worst will be over in a</li>
<li class="L1511" rel="L1511">moment; it is but passing the room-door, and the worst is over. Then,</li>
<li class="L1512" rel="L1512">all the good you bring to him, all the relief, all the happiness you</li>
<li class="L1513" rel="L1513">bring to him, begin. Let our good friend here, assist you on that side.</li>
<li class="L1514" rel="L1514">That&#39;s well, friend Defarge. Come, now. Business, business!”</li>
<li class="L1515" rel="L1515"></li>
<li class="L1516" rel="L1516">They went up slowly and softly. The staircase was short, and they were</li>
<li class="L1517" rel="L1517">soon at the top. There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came all at</li>
<li class="L1518" rel="L1518">once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close together at</li>
<li class="L1519" rel="L1519">the side of a door, and who were intently looking into the room to which</li>
<li class="L1520" rel="L1520">the door belonged, through some chinks or holes in the wall. On hearing</li>
<li class="L1521" rel="L1521">footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed</li>
<li class="L1522" rel="L1522">themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the</li>
<li class="L1523" rel="L1523">wine-shop.</li>
<li class="L1524" rel="L1524"></li>
<li class="L1525" rel="L1525">“I forgot them in the surprise of your visit,” explained Monsieur</li>
<li class="L1526" rel="L1526">Defarge. “Leave us, good boys; we have business here.”</li>
<li class="L1527" rel="L1527"></li>
<li class="L1528" rel="L1528">The three glided by, and went silently down.</li>
<li class="L1529" rel="L1529"></li>
<li class="L1530" rel="L1530">There appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of</li>
<li class="L1531" rel="L1531">the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr.</li>
<li class="L1532" rel="L1532">Lorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger:</li>
<li class="L1533" rel="L1533"></li>
<li class="L1534" rel="L1534">“Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette?”</li>
<li class="L1535" rel="L1535"></li>
<li class="L1536" rel="L1536">“I show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few.”</li>
<li class="L1537" rel="L1537"></li>
<li class="L1538" rel="L1538">“Is that well?”</li>
<li class="L1539" rel="L1539"></li>
<li class="L1540" rel="L1540">“_I_ think it is well.”</li>
<li class="L1541" rel="L1541"></li>
<li class="L1542" rel="L1542">“Who are the few? How do you choose them?”</li>
<li class="L1543" rel="L1543"></li>
<li class="L1544" rel="L1544">“I choose them as real men, of my name--Jacques is my name--to whom the</li>
<li class="L1545" rel="L1545">sight is likely to do good. Enough; you are English; that is another</li>
<li class="L1546" rel="L1546">thing. Stay there, if you please, a little moment.”</li>
<li class="L1547" rel="L1547"></li>
<li class="L1548" rel="L1548">With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked in</li>
<li class="L1549" rel="L1549">through the crevice in the wall. Soon raising his head again, he struck</li>
<li class="L1550" rel="L1550">twice or thrice upon the door--evidently with no other object than to</li>
<li class="L1551" rel="L1551">make a noise there. With the same intention, he drew the key across it,</li>
<li class="L1552" rel="L1552">three or four times, before he put it clumsily into the lock, and turned</li>
<li class="L1553" rel="L1553">it as heavily as he could.</li>
<li class="L1554" rel="L1554"></li>
<li class="L1555" rel="L1555">The door slowly opened inward under his hand, and he looked into the</li>
<li class="L1556" rel="L1556">room and said something. A faint voice answered something. Little more</li>
<li class="L1557" rel="L1557">than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side.</li>
<li class="L1558" rel="L1558"></li>
<li class="L1559" rel="L1559">He looked back over his shoulder, and beckoned them to enter. Mr. Lorry</li>
<li class="L1560" rel="L1560">got his arm securely round the daughter&#39;s waist, and held her; for he</li>
<li class="L1561" rel="L1561">felt that she was sinking.</li>
<li class="L1562" rel="L1562"></li>
<li class="L1563" rel="L1563">“A-a-a-business, business!” he urged, with a moisture that was not of</li>
<li class="L1564" rel="L1564">business shining on his cheek. “Come in, come in!”</li>
<li class="L1565" rel="L1565"></li>
<li class="L1566" rel="L1566">“I am afraid of it,” she answered, shuddering.</li>
<li class="L1567" rel="L1567"></li>
<li class="L1568" rel="L1568">“Of it? What?”</li>
<li class="L1569" rel="L1569"></li>
<li class="L1570" rel="L1570">“I mean of him. Of my father.”</li>
<li class="L1571" rel="L1571"></li>
<li class="L1572" rel="L1572">Rendered in a manner desperate, by her state and by the beckoning of</li>
<li class="L1573" rel="L1573">their conductor, he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his</li>
<li class="L1574" rel="L1574">shoulder, lifted her a little, and hurried her into the room. He sat her</li>
<li class="L1575" rel="L1575">down just within the door, and held her, clinging to him.</li>
<li class="L1576" rel="L1576"></li>
<li class="L1577" rel="L1577">Defarge drew out the key, closed the door, locked it on the inside,</li>
<li class="L1578" rel="L1578">took out the key again, and held it in his hand. All this he did,</li>
<li class="L1579" rel="L1579">methodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he</li>
<li class="L1580" rel="L1580">could make. Finally, he walked across the room with a measured tread to</li>
<li class="L1581" rel="L1581">where the window was. He stopped there, and faced round.</li>
<li class="L1582" rel="L1582"></li>
<li class="L1583" rel="L1583">The garret, built to be a depository for firewood and the like, was dim</li>
<li class="L1584" rel="L1584">and dark: for, the window of dormer shape, was in truth a door in the</li>
<li class="L1585" rel="L1585">roof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from</li>
<li class="L1586" rel="L1586">the street: unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any</li>
<li class="L1587" rel="L1587">other door of French construction. To exclude the cold, one half of this</li>
<li class="L1588" rel="L1588">door was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little way.</li>
<li class="L1589" rel="L1589">Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means, that it</li>
<li class="L1590" rel="L1590">was difficult, on first coming in, to see anything; and long habit</li>
<li class="L1591" rel="L1591">alone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work</li>
<li class="L1592" rel="L1592">requiring nicety in such obscurity. Yet, work of that kind was being</li>
<li class="L1593" rel="L1593">done in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face</li>
<li class="L1594" rel="L1594">towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at</li>
<li class="L1595" rel="L1595">him, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very</li>
<li class="L1596" rel="L1596">busy, making shoes.</li>
<li class="L1597" rel="L1597"></li>
<li class="L1598" rel="L1598"></li>
<li class="L1599" rel="L1599"></li>
<li class="L1600" rel="L1600"></li>
<li class="L1601" rel="L1601">VI. The Shoemaker</li>
<li class="L1602" rel="L1602"></li>
<li class="L1603" rel="L1603"></li>
<li class="L1604" rel="L1604">“Good day!” said Monsieur Defarge, looking down at the white head that</li>
<li class="L1605" rel="L1605">bent low over the shoemaking.</li>
<li class="L1606" rel="L1606"></li>
<li class="L1607" rel="L1607">It was raised for a moment, and a very faint voice responded to the</li>
<li class="L1608" rel="L1608">salutation, as if it were at a distance:</li>
<li class="L1609" rel="L1609"></li>
<li class="L1610" rel="L1610">“Good day!”</li>
<li class="L1611" rel="L1611"></li>
<li class="L1612" rel="L1612">“You are still hard at work, I see?”</li>
<li class="L1613" rel="L1613"></li>
<li class="L1614" rel="L1614">After a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and the</li>
<li class="L1615" rel="L1615">voice replied, “Yes--I am working.” This time, a pair of haggard eyes</li>
<li class="L1616" rel="L1616">had looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again.</li>
<li class="L1617" rel="L1617"></li>
<li class="L1618" rel="L1618">The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful. It was not the</li>
<li class="L1619" rel="L1619">faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no</li>
<li class="L1620" rel="L1620">doubt had their part in it. Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was</li>
<li class="L1621" rel="L1621">the faintness of solitude and disuse. It was like the last feeble echo</li>
<li class="L1622" rel="L1622">of a sound made long and long ago. So entirely had it lost the life and</li>
<li class="L1623" rel="L1623">resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once</li>
<li class="L1624" rel="L1624">beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain. So sunken and</li>
<li class="L1625" rel="L1625">suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground. So expressive</li>
<li class="L1626" rel="L1626">it was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller,</li>
<li class="L1627" rel="L1627">wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered</li>
<li class="L1628" rel="L1628">home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.</li>
<li class="L1629" rel="L1629"></li>
<li class="L1630" rel="L1630">Some minutes of silent work had passed: and the haggard eyes had looked</li>
<li class="L1631" rel="L1631">up again: not with any interest or curiosity, but with a dull mechanical</li>
<li class="L1632" rel="L1632">perception, beforehand, that the spot where the only visitor they were</li>
<li class="L1633" rel="L1633">aware of had stood, was not yet empty.</li>
<li class="L1634" rel="L1634"></li>
<li class="L1635" rel="L1635">“I want,” said Defarge, who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker,</li>
<li class="L1636" rel="L1636">“to let in a little more light here. You can bear a little more?”</li>
<li class="L1637" rel="L1637"></li>
<li class="L1638" rel="L1638">The shoemaker stopped his work; looked with a vacant air of listening,</li>
<li class="L1639" rel="L1639">at the floor on one side of him; then similarly, at the floor on the</li>
<li class="L1640" rel="L1640">other side of him; then, upward at the speaker.</li>
<li class="L1641" rel="L1641"></li>
<li class="L1642" rel="L1642">“What did you say?”</li>
<li class="L1643" rel="L1643"></li>
<li class="L1644" rel="L1644">“You can bear a little more light?”</li>
<li class="L1645" rel="L1645"></li>
<li class="L1646" rel="L1646">“I must bear it, if you let it in.” (Laying the palest shadow of a</li>
<li class="L1647" rel="L1647">stress upon the second word.)</li>
<li class="L1648" rel="L1648"></li>
<li class="L1649" rel="L1649">The opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at that</li>
<li class="L1650" rel="L1650">angle for the time. A broad ray of light fell into the garret, and</li>
<li class="L1651" rel="L1651">showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap, pausing in his</li>
<li class="L1652" rel="L1652">labour. His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his</li>
<li class="L1653" rel="L1653">feet and on his bench. He had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not very</li>
<li class="L1654" rel="L1654">long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes. The hollowness and</li>
<li class="L1655" rel="L1655">thinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under his yet</li>
<li class="L1656" rel="L1656">dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though they had been really</li>
<li class="L1657" rel="L1657">otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so.</li>
<li class="L1658" rel="L1658">His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed his body</li>
<li class="L1659" rel="L1659">to be withered and worn. He, and his old canvas frock, and his loose</li>
<li class="L1660" rel="L1660">stockings, and all his poor tatters of clothes, had, in a long seclusion</li>
<li class="L1661" rel="L1661">from direct light and air, faded down to such a dull uniformity of</li>
<li class="L1662" rel="L1662">parchment-yellow, that it would have been hard to say which was which.</li>
<li class="L1663" rel="L1663"></li>
<li class="L1664" rel="L1664">He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light, and the very bones</li>
<li class="L1665" rel="L1665">of it seemed transparent. So he sat, with a steadfastly vacant gaze,</li>
<li class="L1666" rel="L1666">pausing in his work. He never looked at the figure before him, without</li>
<li class="L1667" rel="L1667">first looking down on this side of himself, then on that, as if he had</li>
<li class="L1668" rel="L1668">lost the habit of associating place with sound; he never spoke, without</li>
<li class="L1669" rel="L1669">first wandering in this manner, and forgetting to speak.</li>
<li class="L1670" rel="L1670"></li>
<li class="L1671" rel="L1671">“Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day?” asked Defarge,</li>
<li class="L1672" rel="L1672">motioning to Mr. Lorry to come forward.</li>
<li class="L1673" rel="L1673"></li>
<li class="L1674" rel="L1674">“What did you say?”</li>
<li class="L1675" rel="L1675"></li>
<li class="L1676" rel="L1676">“Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day?”</li>
<li class="L1677" rel="L1677"></li>
<li class="L1678" rel="L1678">“I can&#39;t say that I mean to. I suppose so. I don&#39;t know.”</li>
<li class="L1679" rel="L1679"></li>
<li class="L1680" rel="L1680">But, the question reminded him of his work, and he bent over it again.</li>
<li class="L1681" rel="L1681"></li>
<li class="L1682" rel="L1682">Mr. Lorry came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door. When</li>
<li class="L1683" rel="L1683">he had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of Defarge, the shoemaker</li>
<li class="L1684" rel="L1684">looked up. He showed no surprise at seeing another figure, but the</li>
<li class="L1685" rel="L1685">unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at</li>
<li class="L1686" rel="L1686">it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour), and then</li>
<li class="L1687" rel="L1687">the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the shoe. The</li>
<li class="L1688" rel="L1688">look and the action had occupied but an instant.</li>
<li class="L1689" rel="L1689"></li>
<li class="L1690" rel="L1690">“You have a visitor, you see,” said Monsieur Defarge.</li>
<li class="L1691" rel="L1691"></li>
<li class="L1692" rel="L1692">“What did you say?”</li>
<li class="L1693" rel="L1693"></li>
<li class="L1694" rel="L1694">“Here is a visitor.”</li>
<li class="L1695" rel="L1695"></li>
<li class="L1696" rel="L1696">The shoemaker looked up as before, but without removing a hand from his</li>
<li class="L1697" rel="L1697">work.</li>
<li class="L1698" rel="L1698"></li>
<li class="L1699" rel="L1699">“Come!” said Defarge. “Here is monsieur, who knows a well-made shoe when</li>
<li class="L1700" rel="L1700">he sees one. Show him that shoe you are working at. Take it, monsieur.”</li>
<li class="L1701" rel="L1701"></li>
<li class="L1702" rel="L1702">Mr. Lorry took it in his hand.</li>
<li class="L1703" rel="L1703"></li>
<li class="L1704" rel="L1704">“Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the maker&#39;s name.”</li>
<li class="L1705" rel="L1705"></li>
<li class="L1706" rel="L1706">There was a longer pause than usual, before the shoemaker replied:</li>
<li class="L1707" rel="L1707"></li>
<li class="L1708" rel="L1708">“I forget what it was you asked me. What did you say?”</li>
<li class="L1709" rel="L1709"></li>
<li class="L1710" rel="L1710">“I said, couldn&#39;t you describe the kind of shoe, for monsieur&#39;s</li>
<li class="L1711" rel="L1711">information?”</li>
<li class="L1712" rel="L1712"></li>
<li class="L1713" rel="L1713">“It is a lady&#39;s shoe. It is a young lady&#39;s walking-shoe. It is in the</li>
<li class="L1714" rel="L1714">present mode. I never saw the mode. I have had a pattern in my hand.” He</li>
<li class="L1715" rel="L1715">glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride.</li>
<li class="L1716" rel="L1716"></li>
<li class="L1717" rel="L1717">“And the maker&#39;s name?” said Defarge.</li>
<li class="L1718" rel="L1718"></li>
<li class="L1719" rel="L1719">Now that he had no work to hold, he laid the knuckles of the right hand</li>
<li class="L1720" rel="L1720">in the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand in the</li>
<li class="L1721" rel="L1721">hollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his bearded chin, and</li>
<li class="L1722" rel="L1722">so on in regular changes, without a moment&#39;s intermission. The task of</li>
<li class="L1723" rel="L1723">recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he</li>
<li class="L1724" rel="L1724">had spoken, was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon, or</li>
<li class="L1725" rel="L1725">endeavouring, in the hope of some disclosure, to stay the spirit of a</li>
<li class="L1726" rel="L1726">fast-dying man.</li>
<li class="L1727" rel="L1727"></li>
<li class="L1728" rel="L1728">“Did you ask me for my name?”</li>
<li class="L1729" rel="L1729"></li>
<li class="L1730" rel="L1730">“Assuredly I did.”</li>
<li class="L1731" rel="L1731"></li>
<li class="L1732" rel="L1732">“One Hundred and Five, North Tower.”</li>
<li class="L1733" rel="L1733"></li>
<li class="L1734" rel="L1734">“Is that all?”</li>
<li class="L1735" rel="L1735"></li>
<li class="L1736" rel="L1736">“One Hundred and Five, North Tower.”</li>
<li class="L1737" rel="L1737"></li>
<li class="L1738" rel="L1738">With a weary sound that was not a sigh, nor a groan, he bent to work</li>
<li class="L1739" rel="L1739">again, until the silence was again broken.</li>
<li class="L1740" rel="L1740"></li>
<li class="L1741" rel="L1741">“You are not a shoemaker by trade?” said Mr. Lorry, looking steadfastly</li>
<li class="L1742" rel="L1742">at him.</li>
<li class="L1743" rel="L1743"></li>
<li class="L1744" rel="L1744">His haggard eyes turned to Defarge as if he would have transferred the</li>
<li class="L1745" rel="L1745">question to him: but as no help came from that quarter, they turned back</li>
<li class="L1746" rel="L1746">on the questioner when they had sought the ground.</li>
<li class="L1747" rel="L1747"></li>
<li class="L1748" rel="L1748">“I am not a shoemaker by trade? No, I was not a shoemaker by trade. I-I</li>
<li class="L1749" rel="L1749">learnt it here. I taught myself. I asked leave to--”</li>
<li class="L1750" rel="L1750"></li>
<li class="L1751" rel="L1751">He lapsed away, even for minutes, ringing those measured changes on his</li>
<li class="L1752" rel="L1752">hands the whole time. His eyes came slowly back, at last, to the face</li>
<li class="L1753" rel="L1753">from which they had wandered; when they rested on it, he started, and</li>
<li class="L1754" rel="L1754">resumed, in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake, reverting to a</li>
<li class="L1755" rel="L1755">subject of last night.</li>
<li class="L1756" rel="L1756"></li>
<li class="L1757" rel="L1757">“I asked leave to teach myself, and I got it with much difficulty after</li>
<li class="L1758" rel="L1758">a long while, and I have made shoes ever since.”</li>
<li class="L1759" rel="L1759"></li>
<li class="L1760" rel="L1760">As he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him, Mr.</li>
<li class="L1761" rel="L1761">Lorry said, still looking steadfastly in his face:</li>
<li class="L1762" rel="L1762"></li>
<li class="L1763" rel="L1763">“Monsieur Manette, do you remember nothing of me?”</li>
<li class="L1764" rel="L1764"></li>
<li class="L1765" rel="L1765">The shoe dropped to the ground, and he sat looking fixedly at the</li>
<li class="L1766" rel="L1766">questioner.</li>
<li class="L1767" rel="L1767"></li>
<li class="L1768" rel="L1768">“Monsieur Manette”; Mr. Lorry laid his hand upon Defarge&#39;s arm; “do you</li>
<li class="L1769" rel="L1769">remember nothing of this man? Look at him. Look at me. Is there no old</li>
<li class="L1770" rel="L1770">banker, no old business, no old servant, no old time, rising in your</li>
<li class="L1771" rel="L1771">mind, Monsieur Manette?”</li>
<li class="L1772" rel="L1772"></li>
<li class="L1773" rel="L1773">As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly, by turns, at Mr.</li>
<li class="L1774" rel="L1774">Lorry and at Defarge, some long obliterated marks of an actively intent</li>
<li class="L1775" rel="L1775">intelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves</li>
<li class="L1776" rel="L1776">through the black mist that had fallen on him. They were overclouded</li>
<li class="L1777" rel="L1777">again, they were fainter, they were gone; but they had been there. And</li>
<li class="L1778" rel="L1778">so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who</li>
<li class="L1779" rel="L1779">had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him, and where</li>
<li class="L1780" rel="L1780">she now stood looking at him, with hands which at first had been only</li>
<li class="L1781" rel="L1781">raised in frightened compassion, if not even to keep him off and</li>
<li class="L1782" rel="L1782">shut out the sight of him, but which were now extending towards him,</li>
<li class="L1783" rel="L1783">trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young</li>
<li class="L1784" rel="L1784">breast, and love it back to life and hope--so exactly was the expression</li>
<li class="L1785" rel="L1785">repeated (though in stronger characters) on her fair young face, that it</li>
<li class="L1786" rel="L1786">looked as though it had passed like a moving light, from him to her.</li>
<li class="L1787" rel="L1787"></li>
<li class="L1788" rel="L1788">Darkness had fallen on him in its place. He looked at the two, less and</li>
<li class="L1789" rel="L1789">less attentively, and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground</li>
<li class="L1790" rel="L1790">and looked about him in the old way. Finally, with a deep long sigh, he</li>
<li class="L1791" rel="L1791">took the shoe up, and resumed his work.</li>
<li class="L1792" rel="L1792"></li>
<li class="L1793" rel="L1793">“Have you recognised him, monsieur?” asked Defarge in a whisper.</li>
<li class="L1794" rel="L1794"></li>
<li class="L1795" rel="L1795">“Yes; for a moment. At first I thought it quite hopeless, but I have</li>
<li class="L1796" rel="L1796">unquestionably seen, for a single moment, the face that I once knew so</li>
<li class="L1797" rel="L1797">well. Hush! Let us draw further back. Hush!”</li>
<li class="L1798" rel="L1798"></li>
<li class="L1799" rel="L1799">She had moved from the wall of the garret, very near to the bench on</li>
<li class="L1800" rel="L1800">which he sat. There was something awful in his unconsciousness of the</li>
<li class="L1801" rel="L1801">figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped</li>
<li class="L1802" rel="L1802">over his labour.</li>
<li class="L1803" rel="L1803"></li>
<li class="L1804" rel="L1804">Not a word was spoken, not a sound was made. She stood, like a spirit,</li>
<li class="L1805" rel="L1805">beside him, and he bent over his work.</li>
<li class="L1806" rel="L1806"></li>
<li class="L1807" rel="L1807">It happened, at length, that he had occasion to change the instrument</li>
<li class="L1808" rel="L1808">in his hand, for his shoemaker&#39;s knife. It lay on that side of him</li>
<li class="L1809" rel="L1809">which was not the side on which she stood. He had taken it up, and was</li>
<li class="L1810" rel="L1810">stooping to work again, when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress. He</li>
<li class="L1811" rel="L1811">raised them, and saw her face. The two spectators started forward,</li>
<li class="L1812" rel="L1812">but she stayed them with a motion of her hand. She had no fear of his</li>
<li class="L1813" rel="L1813">striking at her with the knife, though they had.</li>
<li class="L1814" rel="L1814"></li>
<li class="L1815" rel="L1815">He stared at her with a fearful look, and after a while his lips began</li>
<li class="L1816" rel="L1816">to form some words, though no sound proceeded from them. By degrees, in</li>
<li class="L1817" rel="L1817">the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing, he was heard to say:</li>
<li class="L1818" rel="L1818"></li>
<li class="L1819" rel="L1819">“What is this?”</li>
<li class="L1820" rel="L1820"></li>
<li class="L1821" rel="L1821">With the tears streaming down her face, she put her two hands to her</li>
<li class="L1822" rel="L1822">lips, and kissed them to him; then clasped them on her breast, as if she</li>
<li class="L1823" rel="L1823">laid his ruined head there.</li>
<li class="L1824" rel="L1824"></li>
<li class="L1825" rel="L1825">“You are not the gaoler&#39;s daughter?”</li>
<li class="L1826" rel="L1826"></li>
<li class="L1827" rel="L1827">She sighed “No.”</li>
<li class="L1828" rel="L1828"></li>
<li class="L1829" rel="L1829">“Who are you?”</li>
<li class="L1830" rel="L1830"></li>
<li class="L1831" rel="L1831">Not yet trusting the tones of her voice, she sat down on the bench</li>
<li class="L1832" rel="L1832">beside him. He recoiled, but she laid her hand upon his arm. A strange</li>
<li class="L1833" rel="L1833">thrill struck him when she did so, and visibly passed over his frame; he</li>
<li class="L1834" rel="L1834">laid the knife down softly, as he sat staring at her.</li>
<li class="L1835" rel="L1835"></li>
<li class="L1836" rel="L1836">Her golden hair, which she wore in long curls, had been hurriedly pushed</li>
<li class="L1837" rel="L1837">aside, and fell down over her neck. Advancing his hand by little and</li>
<li class="L1838" rel="L1838">little, he took it up and looked at it. In the midst of the action</li>
<li class="L1839" rel="L1839">he went astray, and, with another deep sigh, fell to work at his</li>
<li class="L1840" rel="L1840">shoemaking.</li>
<li class="L1841" rel="L1841"></li>
<li class="L1842" rel="L1842">But not for long. Releasing his arm, she laid her hand upon his</li>
<li class="L1843" rel="L1843">shoulder. After looking doubtfully at it, two or three times, as if to</li>
<li class="L1844" rel="L1844">be sure that it was really there, he laid down his work, put his hand</li>
<li class="L1845" rel="L1845">to his neck, and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag</li>
<li class="L1846" rel="L1846">attached to it. He opened this, carefully, on his knee, and it contained</li>
<li class="L1847" rel="L1847">a very little quantity of hair: not more than one or two long golden</li>
<li class="L1848" rel="L1848">hairs, which he had, in some old day, wound off upon his finger.</li>
<li class="L1849" rel="L1849"></li>
<li class="L1850" rel="L1850">He took her hair into his hand again, and looked closely at it. “It is</li>
<li class="L1851" rel="L1851">the same. How can it be! When was it! How was it!”</li>
<li class="L1852" rel="L1852"></li>
<li class="L1853" rel="L1853">As the concentrated expression returned to his forehead, he seemed to</li>
<li class="L1854" rel="L1854">become conscious that it was in hers too. He turned her full to the</li>
<li class="L1855" rel="L1855">light, and looked at her.</li>
<li class="L1856" rel="L1856"></li>
<li class="L1857" rel="L1857">“She had laid her head upon my shoulder, that night when I was summoned</li>
<li class="L1858" rel="L1858">out--she had a fear of my going, though I had none--and when I was</li>
<li class="L1859" rel="L1859">brought to the North Tower they found these upon my sleeve. &#39;You will</li>
<li class="L1860" rel="L1860">leave me them? They can never help me to escape in the body, though they</li>
<li class="L1861" rel="L1861">may in the spirit.&#39; Those were the words I said. I remember them very</li>
<li class="L1862" rel="L1862">well.”</li>
<li class="L1863" rel="L1863"></li>
<li class="L1864" rel="L1864">He formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it.</li>
<li class="L1865" rel="L1865">But when he did find spoken words for it, they came to him coherently,</li>
<li class="L1866" rel="L1866">though slowly.</li>
<li class="L1867" rel="L1867"></li>
<li class="L1868" rel="L1868">“How was this?--_Was it you_?”</li>
<li class="L1869" rel="L1869"></li>
<li class="L1870" rel="L1870">Once more, the two spectators started, as he turned upon her with a</li>
<li class="L1871" rel="L1871">frightful suddenness. But she sat perfectly still in his grasp, and only</li>
<li class="L1872" rel="L1872">said, in a low voice, “I entreat you, good gentlemen, do not come near</li>
<li class="L1873" rel="L1873">us, do not speak, do not move!”</li>
<li class="L1874" rel="L1874"></li>
<li class="L1875" rel="L1875">“Hark!” he exclaimed. “Whose voice was that?”</li>
<li class="L1876" rel="L1876"></li>
<li class="L1877" rel="L1877">His hands released her as he uttered this cry, and went up to his white</li>
<li class="L1878" rel="L1878">hair, which they tore in a frenzy. It died out, as everything but his</li>
<li class="L1879" rel="L1879">shoemaking did die out of him, and he refolded his little packet and</li>
<li class="L1880" rel="L1880">tried to secure it in his breast; but he still looked at her, and</li>
<li class="L1881" rel="L1881">gloomily shook his head.</li>
<li class="L1882" rel="L1882"></li>
<li class="L1883" rel="L1883">“No, no, no; you are too young, too blooming. It can&#39;t be. See what the</li>
<li class="L1884" rel="L1884">prisoner is. These are not the hands she knew, this is not the face</li>
<li class="L1885" rel="L1885">she knew, this is not a voice she ever heard. No, no. She was--and He</li>
<li class="L1886" rel="L1886">was--before the slow years of the North Tower--ages ago. What is your</li>
<li class="L1887" rel="L1887">name, my gentle angel?”</li>
<li class="L1888" rel="L1888"></li>
<li class="L1889" rel="L1889">Hailing his softened tone and manner, his daughter fell upon her knees</li>
<li class="L1890" rel="L1890">before him, with her appealing hands upon his breast.</li>
<li class="L1891" rel="L1891"></li>
<li class="L1892" rel="L1892">“O, sir, at another time you shall know my name, and who my mother was,</li>
<li class="L1893" rel="L1893">and who my father, and how I never knew their hard, hard history. But I</li>
<li class="L1894" rel="L1894">cannot tell you at this time, and I cannot tell you here. All that I may</li>
<li class="L1895" rel="L1895">tell you, here and now, is, that I pray to you to touch me and to bless</li>
<li class="L1896" rel="L1896">me. Kiss me, kiss me! O my dear, my dear!”</li>

<li class="L1898" rel="L1898">His cold white head mingled with her radiant hair, which warmed and</li>
<li class="L1899" rel="L1899">lighted it as though it were the light of Freedom shining on him.</li>
<li class="L1900" rel="L1900"></li>
<li class="L1901" rel="L1901">“If you hear in my voice--I don&#39;t know that it is so, but I hope it</li>
<li class="L1902" rel="L1902">is--if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was</li>
<li class="L1903" rel="L1903">sweet music in your ears, weep for it, weep for it! If you touch, in</li>
<li class="L1904" rel="L1904">touching my hair, anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your</li>
<li class="L1905" rel="L1905">breast when you were young and free, weep for it, weep for it! If, when</li>
<li class="L1906" rel="L1906">I hint to you of a Home that is before us, where I will be true to you</li>
<li class="L1907" rel="L1907">with all my duty and with all my faithful service, I bring back the</li>
<li class="L1908" rel="L1908">remembrance of a Home long desolate, while your poor heart pined away,</li>
<li class="L1909" rel="L1909">weep for it, weep for it!”</li>
<li class="L1910" rel="L1910"></li>
<li class="L1911" rel="L1911">She held him closer round the neck, and rocked him on her breast like a</li>
<li class="L1912" rel="L1912">child.</li>
<li class="L1913" rel="L1913"></li>
<li class="L1914" rel="L1914">“If, when I tell you, dearest dear, that your agony is over, and that I</li>
<li class="L1915" rel="L1915">have come here to take you from it, and that we go to England to be at</li>
<li class="L1916" rel="L1916">peace and at rest, I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste,</li>
<li class="L1917" rel="L1917">and of our native France so wicked to you, weep for it, weep for it! And</li>
<li class="L1918" rel="L1918">if, when I shall tell you of my name, and of my father who is living,</li>
<li class="L1919" rel="L1919">and of my mother who is dead, you learn that I have to kneel to my</li>
<li class="L1920" rel="L1920">honoured father, and implore his pardon for having never for his sake</li>
<li class="L1921" rel="L1921">striven all day and lain awake and wept all night, because the love of</li>
<li class="L1922" rel="L1922">my poor mother hid his torture from me, weep for it, weep for it! Weep</li>
<li class="L1923" rel="L1923">for her, then, and for me! Good gentlemen, thank God! I feel his sacred</li>
<li class="L1924" rel="L1924">tears upon my face, and his sobs strike against my heart. O, see! Thank</li>
<li class="L1925" rel="L1925">God for us, thank God!”</li>
<li class="L1926" rel="L1926"></li>
<li class="L1927" rel="L1927">He had sunk in her arms, and his face dropped on her breast: a sight so</li>
<li class="L1928" rel="L1928">touching, yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which</li>
<li class="L1929" rel="L1929">had gone before it, that the two beholders covered their faces.</li>
<li class="L1930" rel="L1930"></li>
<li class="L1931" rel="L1931">When the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed, and his heaving</li>
<li class="L1932" rel="L1932">breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all</li>
<li class="L1933" rel="L1933">storms--emblem to humanity, of the rest and silence into which the storm</li>
<li class="L1934" rel="L1934">called Life must hush at last--they came forward to raise the father and</li>
<li class="L1935" rel="L1935">daughter from the ground. He had gradually dropped to the floor, and lay</li>
<li class="L1936" rel="L1936">there in a lethargy, worn out. She had nestled down with him, that his</li>
<li class="L1937" rel="L1937">head might lie upon her arm; and her hair drooping over him curtained</li>
<li class="L1938" rel="L1938">him from the light.</li>
<li class="L1939" rel="L1939"></li>
<li class="L1940" rel="L1940">“If, without disturbing him,” she said, raising her hand to Mr. Lorry as</li>
<li class="L1941" rel="L1941">he stooped over them, after repeated blowings of his nose, “all could be</li>
<li class="L1942" rel="L1942">arranged for our leaving Paris at once, so that, from the very door, he</li>
<li class="L1943" rel="L1943">could be taken away--”</li>
<li class="L1944" rel="L1944"></li>
<li class="L1945" rel="L1945">“But, consider. Is he fit for the journey?” asked Mr. Lorry.</li>
<li class="L1946" rel="L1946"></li>
<li class="L1947" rel="L1947">“More fit for that, I think, than to remain in this city, so dreadful to</li>
<li class="L1948" rel="L1948">him.”</li>
<li class="L1949" rel="L1949"></li>
<li class="L1950" rel="L1950">“It is true,” said Defarge, who was kneeling to look on and hear. “More</li>
<li class="L1951" rel="L1951">than that; Monsieur Manette is, for all reasons, best out of France.</li>
<li class="L1952" rel="L1952">Say, shall I hire a carriage and post-horses?”</li>
<li class="L1953" rel="L1953"></li>
<li class="L1954" rel="L1954">“That&#39;s business,” said Mr. Lorry, resuming on the shortest notice his</li>
<li class="L1955" rel="L1955">methodical manners; “and if business is to be done, I had better do it.”</li>
<li class="L1956" rel="L1956"></li>
<li class="L1957" rel="L1957">“Then be so kind,” urged Miss Manette, “as to leave us here. You see how</li>
<li class="L1958" rel="L1958">composed he has become, and you cannot be afraid to leave him with me</li>
<li class="L1959" rel="L1959">now. Why should you be? If you will lock the door to secure us from</li>
<li class="L1960" rel="L1960">interruption, I do not doubt that you will find him, when you come back,</li>
<li class="L1961" rel="L1961">as quiet as you leave him. In any case, I will take care of him until</li>
<li class="L1962" rel="L1962">you return, and then we will remove him straight.”</li>
<li class="L1963" rel="L1963"></li>
<li class="L1964" rel="L1964">Both Mr. Lorry and Defarge were rather disinclined to this course, and</li>
<li class="L1965" rel="L1965">in favour of one of them remaining. But, as there were not only carriage</li>
<li class="L1966" rel="L1966">and horses to be seen to, but travelling papers; and as time pressed,</li>
<li class="L1967" rel="L1967">for the day was drawing to an end, it came at last to their hastily</li>
<li class="L1968" rel="L1968">dividing the business that was necessary to be done, and hurrying away</li>
<li class="L1969" rel="L1969">to do it.</li>
<li class="L1970" rel="L1970"></li>
<li class="L1971" rel="L1971">Then, as the darkness closed in, the daughter laid her head down on the</li>
<li class="L1972" rel="L1972">hard ground close at the father&#39;s side, and watched him. The darkness</li>
<li class="L1973" rel="L1973">deepened and deepened, and they both lay quiet, until a light gleamed</li>
<li class="L1974" rel="L1974">through the chinks in the wall.</li>
<li class="L1975" rel="L1975"></li>
<li class="L1976" rel="L1976">Mr. Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all ready for the journey, and</li>
<li class="L1977" rel="L1977">had brought with them, besides travelling cloaks and wrappers, bread and</li>
<li class="L1978" rel="L1978">meat, wine, and hot coffee. Monsieur Defarge put this provender, and the</li>
<li class="L1979" rel="L1979">lamp he carried, on the shoemaker&#39;s bench (there was nothing else in the</li>
<li class="L1980" rel="L1980">garret but a pallet bed), and he and Mr. Lorry roused the captive, and</li>
<li class="L1981" rel="L1981">assisted him to his feet.</li>
<li class="L1982" rel="L1982"></li>
<li class="L1983" rel="L1983">No human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind, in</li>
<li class="L1984" rel="L1984">the scared blank wonder of his face. Whether he knew what had happened,</li>
<li class="L1985" rel="L1985">whether he recollected what they had said to him, whether he knew that</li>
<li class="L1986" rel="L1986">he was free, were questions which no sagacity could have solved. They</li>
<li class="L1987" rel="L1987">tried speaking to him; but, he was so confused, and so very slow to</li>
<li class="L1988" rel="L1988">answer, that they took fright at his bewilderment, and agreed for</li>
<li class="L1989" rel="L1989">the time to tamper with him no more. He had a wild, lost manner of</li>
<li class="L1990" rel="L1990">occasionally clasping his head in his hands, that had not been seen</li>
<li class="L1991" rel="L1991">in him before; yet, he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his</li>
<li class="L1992" rel="L1992">daughter&#39;s voice, and invariably turned to it when she spoke.</li>
<li class="L1993" rel="L1993"></li>
<li class="L1994" rel="L1994">In the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion, he</li>
<li class="L1995" rel="L1995">ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink, and put on the cloak</li>
<li class="L1996" rel="L1996">and other wrappings, that they gave him to wear. He readily responded to</li>
<li class="L1997" rel="L1997">his daughter&#39;s drawing her arm through his, and took--and kept--her hand</li>
<li class="L1998" rel="L1998">in both his own.</li>
<li class="L1999" rel="L1999"></li>
<li class="L2000" rel="L2000">They began to descend; Monsieur Defarge going first with the lamp, Mr.</li>
<li class="L2001" rel="L2001">Lorry closing the little procession. They had not traversed many steps</li>
<li class="L2002" rel="L2002">of the long main staircase when he stopped, and stared at the roof and</li>
<li class="L2003" rel="L2003">round at the walls.</li>
<li class="L2004" rel="L2004"></li>
<li class="L2005" rel="L2005">“You remember the place, my father? You remember coming up here?”</li>
<li class="L2006" rel="L2006"></li>
<li class="L2007" rel="L2007">“What did you say?”</li>
<li class="L2008" rel="L2008"></li>
<li class="L2009" rel="L2009">But, before she could repeat the question, he murmured an answer as if</li>
<li class="L2010" rel="L2010">she had repeated it.</li>
<li class="L2011" rel="L2011"></li>
<li class="L2012" rel="L2012">“Remember? No, I don&#39;t remember. It was so very long ago.”</li>
<li class="L2013" rel="L2013"></li>
<li class="L2014" rel="L2014">That he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his</li>
<li class="L2015" rel="L2015">prison to that house, was apparent to them. They heard him mutter,</li>
<li class="L2016" rel="L2016">“One Hundred and Five, North Tower;” and when he looked about him, it</li>
<li class="L2017" rel="L2017">evidently was for the strong fortress-walls which had long encompassed</li>
<li class="L2018" rel="L2018">him. On their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his</li>
<li class="L2019" rel="L2019">tread, as being in expectation of a drawbridge; and when there was</li>
<li class="L2020" rel="L2020">no drawbridge, and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street, he</li>
<li class="L2021" rel="L2021">dropped his daughter&#39;s hand and clasped his head again.</li>
<li class="L2022" rel="L2022"></li>
<li class="L2023" rel="L2023">No crowd was about the door; no people were discernible at any of the</li>
<li class="L2024" rel="L2024">many windows; not even a chance passerby was in the street. An unnatural</li>
<li class="L2025" rel="L2025">silence and desertion reigned there. Only one soul was to be seen, and</li>
<li class="L2026" rel="L2026">that was Madame Defarge--who leaned against the door-post, knitting, and</li>
<li class="L2027" rel="L2027">saw nothing.</li>
<li class="L2028" rel="L2028"></li>
<li class="L2029" rel="L2029">The prisoner had got into a coach, and his daughter had followed</li>
<li class="L2030" rel="L2030">him, when Mr. Lorry&#39;s feet were arrested on the step by his asking,</li>
<li class="L2031" rel="L2031">miserably, for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes. Madame</li>
<li class="L2032" rel="L2032">Defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them, and</li>
<li class="L2033" rel="L2033">went, knitting, out of the lamplight, through the courtyard. She quickly</li>
<li class="L2034" rel="L2034">brought them down and handed them in;--and immediately afterwards leaned</li>
<li class="L2035" rel="L2035">against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing.</li>
<li class="L2036" rel="L2036"></li>
<li class="L2037" rel="L2037">Defarge got upon the box, and gave the word “To the Barrier!” The</li>
<li class="L2038" rel="L2038">postilion cracked his whip, and they clattered away under the feeble</li>
<li class="L2039" rel="L2039">over-swinging lamps.</li>
<li class="L2040" rel="L2040"></li>
<li class="L2041" rel="L2041">Under the over-swinging lamps--swinging ever brighter in the better</li>
<li class="L2042" rel="L2042">streets, and ever dimmer in the worse--and by lighted shops, gay crowds,</li>
<li class="L2043" rel="L2043">illuminated coffee-houses, and theatre-doors, to one of the city</li>
<li class="L2044" rel="L2044">gates. Soldiers with lanterns, at the guard-house there. “Your papers,</li>
<li class="L2045" rel="L2045">travellers!” “See here then, Monsieur the Officer,” said Defarge,</li>
<li class="L2046" rel="L2046">getting down, and taking him gravely apart, “these are the papers of</li>
<li class="L2047" rel="L2047">monsieur inside, with the white head. They were consigned to me, with</li>
<li class="L2048" rel="L2048">him, at the--” He dropped his voice, there was a flutter among the</li>
<li class="L2049" rel="L2049">military lanterns, and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm</li>
<li class="L2050" rel="L2050">in uniform, the eyes connected with the arm looked, not an every day</li>
<li class="L2051" rel="L2051">or an every night look, at monsieur with the white head. “It is well.</li>
<li class="L2052" rel="L2052">Forward!” from the uniform. “Adieu!” from Defarge. And so, under a short</li>
<li class="L2053" rel="L2053">grove of feebler and feebler over-swinging lamps, out under the great</li>
<li class="L2054" rel="L2054">grove of stars.</li>
<li class="L2055" rel="L2055"></li>
<li class="L2056" rel="L2056">Beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights; some, so remote from</li>
<li class="L2057" rel="L2057">this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their</li>
<li class="L2058" rel="L2058">rays have even yet discovered it, as a point in space where anything</li>
<li class="L2059" rel="L2059">is suffered or done: the shadows of the night were broad and black.</li>
<li class="L2060" rel="L2060">All through the cold and restless interval, until dawn, they once more</li>
<li class="L2061" rel="L2061">whispered in the ears of Mr. Jarvis Lorry--sitting opposite the buried</li>
<li class="L2062" rel="L2062">man who had been dug out, and wondering what subtle powers were for ever</li>
<li class="L2063" rel="L2063">lost to him, and what were capable of restoration--the old inquiry:</li>
<li class="L2064" rel="L2064"></li>
<li class="L2065" rel="L2065">“I hope you care to be recalled to life?”</li>
<li class="L2066" rel="L2066"></li>
<li class="L2067" rel="L2067">And the old answer:</li>
<li class="L2068" rel="L2068"></li>
<li class="L2069" rel="L2069">“I can&#39;t say.”</li>

<li class="L2085" rel="L2085"></li>
<li class="L2086" rel="L2086">Tellson&#39;s Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place, even in the</li>
<li class="L2087" rel="L2087">year one thousand seven hundred and eighty. It was very small, very</li>
<li class="L2088" rel="L2088">dark, very ugly, very incommodious. It was an old-fashioned place,</li>
<li class="L2089" rel="L2089">moreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were</li>
<li class="L2090" rel="L2090">proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness,</li>
<li class="L2091" rel="L2091">proud of its incommodiousness. They were even boastful of its eminence</li>
<li class="L2092" rel="L2092">in those particulars, and were fired by an express conviction that, if</li>
<li class="L2093" rel="L2093">it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable. This was</li>
<li class="L2094" rel="L2094">no passive belief, but an active weapon which they flashed at more</li>
<li class="L2095" rel="L2095">convenient places of business. Tellson&#39;s (they said) wanted</li>
<li class="L2096" rel="L2096">no elbow-room, Tellson&#39;s wanted no light, Tellson&#39;s wanted no</li>
<li class="L2097" rel="L2097">embellishment. Noakes and Co.&#39;s might, or Snooks Brothers&#39; might; but</li>
<li class="L2098" rel="L2098">Tellson&#39;s, thank Heaven--!</li>
<li class="L2099" rel="L2099"></li>
<li class="L2100" rel="L2100">Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the</li>
<li class="L2101" rel="L2101">question of rebuilding Tellson&#39;s. In this respect the House was much</li>
<li class="L2102" rel="L2102">on a par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for</li>
<li class="L2103" rel="L2103">suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly</li>
<li class="L2104" rel="L2104">objectionable, but were only the more respectable.</li>
<li class="L2105" rel="L2105"></li>
<li class="L2106" rel="L2106">Thus it had come to pass, that Tellson&#39;s was the triumphant perfection</li>
<li class="L2107" rel="L2107">of inconvenience. After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with</li>
<li class="L2108" rel="L2108">a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellson&#39;s down two steps,</li>
<li class="L2109" rel="L2109">and came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little</li>
<li class="L2110" rel="L2110">counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the</li>
<li class="L2111" rel="L2111">wind rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of</li>
<li class="L2112" rel="L2112">windows, which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street,</li>
<li class="L2113" rel="L2113">and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the</li>
<li class="L2114" rel="L2114">heavy shadow of Temple Bar. If your business necessitated your seeing</li>
<li class="L2115" rel="L2115">“the House,” you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the back,</li>
<li class="L2116" rel="L2116">where you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came with its</li>
<li class="L2117" rel="L2117">hands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal</li>
<li class="L2118" rel="L2118">twilight. Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old wooden</li>
<li class="L2119" rel="L2119">drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when</li>
<li class="L2120" rel="L2120">they were opened and shut. Your bank-notes had a musty odour, as if they</li>
<li class="L2121" rel="L2121">were fast decomposing into rags again. Your plate was stowed away among</li>
<li class="L2122" rel="L2122">the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good</li>
<li class="L2123" rel="L2123">polish in a day or two. Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms</li>
<li class="L2124" rel="L2124">made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted all the fat out of their</li>
<li class="L2125" rel="L2125">parchments into the banking-house air. Your lighter boxes of family</li>
<li class="L2126" rel="L2126">papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great</li>
<li class="L2127" rel="L2127">dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in the year</li>
<li class="L2128" rel="L2128">one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first letters written to you</li>
<li class="L2129" rel="L2129">by your old love, or by your little children, were but newly released</li>
<li class="L2130" rel="L2130">from the horror of being ogled through the windows, by the heads</li>
<li class="L2131" rel="L2131">exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of</li>
<li class="L2132" rel="L2132">Abyssinia or Ashantee.</li>

<li class="L2134" rel="L2134">But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue</li>
<li class="L2135" rel="L2135">with all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellson&#39;s.</li>
<li class="L2136" rel="L2136">Death is Nature&#39;s remedy for all things, and why not Legislation&#39;s?</li>
<li class="L2137" rel="L2137">Accordingly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note</li>
<li class="L2138" rel="L2138">was put to Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the</li>
<li class="L2139" rel="L2139">purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder</li>
<li class="L2140" rel="L2140">of a horse at Tellson&#39;s door, who made off with it, was put to</li>
<li class="L2141" rel="L2141">Death; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of</li>
<li class="L2142" rel="L2142">three-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to</li>
<li class="L2143" rel="L2143">Death. Not that it did the least good in the way of prevention--it</li>
<li class="L2144" rel="L2144">might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the</li>
<li class="L2145" rel="L2145">reverse--but, it cleared off (as to this world) the trouble of each</li>
<li class="L2146" rel="L2146">particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked</li>
<li class="L2147" rel="L2147">after. Thus, Tellson&#39;s, in its day, like greater places of business,</li>
<li class="L2148" rel="L2148">its contemporaries, had taken so many lives, that, if the heads laid</li>
<li class="L2149" rel="L2149">low before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately</li>
<li class="L2150" rel="L2150">disposed of, they would probably have excluded what little light the</li>
<li class="L2151" rel="L2151">ground floor had, in a rather significant manner.</li>
<li class="L2152" rel="L2152"></li>
<li class="L2153" rel="L2153">Cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at Tellson&#39;s, the</li>
<li class="L2154" rel="L2154">oldest of men carried on the business gravely. When they took a young</li>
<li class="L2155" rel="L2155">man into Tellson&#39;s London house, they hid him somewhere till he was</li>
<li class="L2156" rel="L2156">old. They kept him in a dark place, like a cheese, until he had the full</li>
<li class="L2157" rel="L2157">Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him. Then only was he permitted to</li>
<li class="L2158" rel="L2158">be seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and casting his breeches</li>
<li class="L2159" rel="L2159">and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment.</li>
<li class="L2160" rel="L2160"></li>
<li class="L2161" rel="L2161">Outside Tellson&#39;s--never by any means in it, unless called in--was an</li>
<li class="L2162" rel="L2162">odd-job-man, an occasional porter and messenger, who served as the live</li>
<li class="L2163" rel="L2163">sign of the house. He was never absent during business hours, unless</li>
<li class="L2164" rel="L2164">upon an errand, and then he was represented by his son: a grisly urchin</li>
<li class="L2165" rel="L2165">of twelve, who was his express image. People understood that Tellson&#39;s,</li>
<li class="L2166" rel="L2166">in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man. The house had always</li>
<li class="L2167" rel="L2167">tolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had drifted</li>
<li class="L2168" rel="L2168">this person to the post. His surname was Cruncher, and on the youthful</li>
<li class="L2169" rel="L2169">occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness, in the</li>
<li class="L2170" rel="L2170">easterly parish church of Hounsditch, he had received the added</li>
<li class="L2171" rel="L2171">appellation of Jerry.</li>
<li class="L2172" rel="L2172"></li>
<li class="L2173" rel="L2173">The scene was Mr. Cruncher&#39;s private lodging in Hanging-sword-alley,</li>
<li class="L2174" rel="L2174">Whitefriars: the time, half-past seven of the clock on a windy March</li>
<li class="L2175" rel="L2175">morning, Anno Domini seventeen hundred and eighty. (Mr. Cruncher himself</li>
<li class="L2176" rel="L2176">always spoke of the year of our Lord as Anna Dominoes: apparently under</li>
<li class="L2177" rel="L2177">the impression that the Christian era dated from the invention of a</li>
<li class="L2178" rel="L2178">popular game, by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it.)</li>
<li class="L2179" rel="L2179"></li>
<li class="L2180" rel="L2180">Mr. Cruncher&#39;s apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood, and were</li>
<li class="L2181" rel="L2181">but two in number, even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it</li>
<li class="L2182" rel="L2182">might be counted as one. But they were very decently kept. Early as</li>
<li class="L2183" rel="L2183">it was, on the windy March morning, the room in which he lay abed was</li>
<li class="L2184" rel="L2184">already scrubbed throughout; and between the cups and saucers arranged</li>
<li class="L2185" rel="L2185">for breakfast, and the lumbering deal table, a very clean white cloth</li>
<li class="L2186" rel="L2186">was spread.</li>
<li class="L2187" rel="L2187"></li>
<li class="L2188" rel="L2188">Mr. Cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane, like a Harlequin</li>
<li class="L2189" rel="L2189">at home. At first, he slept heavily, but, by degrees, began to roll</li>
<li class="L2190" rel="L2190">and surge in bed, until he rose above the surface, with his spiky hair</li>
<li class="L2191" rel="L2191">looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons. At which juncture, he</li>
<li class="L2192" rel="L2192">exclaimed, in a voice of dire exasperation:</li>
<li class="L2193" rel="L2193"></li>
<li class="L2194" rel="L2194">“Bust me, if she ain&#39;t at it agin!”</li>
<li class="L2195" rel="L2195"></li>
<li class="L2196" rel="L2196">A woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees in a</li>
<li class="L2197" rel="L2197">corner, with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was the</li>
<li class="L2198" rel="L2198">person referred to.</li>
<li class="L2199" rel="L2199"></li>
<li class="L2200" rel="L2200">“What!” said Mr. Cruncher, looking out of bed for a boot. “You&#39;re at it</li>
<li class="L2201" rel="L2201">agin, are you?”</li>
<li class="L2202" rel="L2202"></li>
<li class="L2203" rel="L2203">After hailing the morn with this second salutation, he threw a boot at</li>
<li class="L2204" rel="L2204">the woman as a third. It was a very muddy boot, and may introduce the</li>
<li class="L2205" rel="L2205">odd circumstance connected with Mr. Cruncher&#39;s domestic economy, that,</li>
<li class="L2206" rel="L2206">whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots, he</li>
<li class="L2207" rel="L2207">often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay.</li>
<li class="L2208" rel="L2208"></li>
<li class="L2209" rel="L2209">“What,” said Mr. Cruncher, varying his apostrophe after missing his</li>
<li class="L2210" rel="L2210">mark--“what are you up to, Aggerawayter?”</li>
<li class="L2211" rel="L2211"></li>
<li class="L2212" rel="L2212">“I was only saying my prayers.”</li>
<li class="L2213" rel="L2213"></li>
<li class="L2214" rel="L2214">“Saying your prayers! You&#39;re a nice woman! What do you mean by flopping</li>
<li class="L2215" rel="L2215">yourself down and praying agin me?”</li>
<li class="L2216" rel="L2216"></li>
<li class="L2217" rel="L2217">“I was not praying against you; I was praying for you.”</li>
<li class="L2218" rel="L2218"></li>
<li class="L2219" rel="L2219">“You weren&#39;t. And if you were, I won&#39;t be took the liberty with. Here!</li>
<li class="L2220" rel="L2220">your mother&#39;s a nice woman, young Jerry, going a praying agin your</li>
<li class="L2221" rel="L2221">father&#39;s prosperity. You&#39;ve got a dutiful mother, you have, my son.</li>
<li class="L2222" rel="L2222">You&#39;ve got a religious mother, you have, my boy: going and flopping</li>
<li class="L2223" rel="L2223">herself down, and praying that the bread-and-butter may be snatched out</li>
<li class="L2224" rel="L2224">of the mouth of her only child.”</li>
<li class="L2225" rel="L2225"></li>
<li class="L2226" rel="L2226">Master Cruncher (who was in his shirt) took this very ill, and, turning</li>
<li class="L2227" rel="L2227">to his mother, strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal</li>
<li class="L2228" rel="L2228">board.</li>
<li class="L2229" rel="L2229"></li>
<li class="L2230" rel="L2230">“And what do you suppose, you conceited female,” said Mr. Cruncher, with</li>
<li class="L2231" rel="L2231">unconscious inconsistency, “that the worth of _your_ prayers may be?</li>
<li class="L2232" rel="L2232">Name the price that you put _your_ prayers at!”</li>
<li class="L2233" rel="L2233"></li>
<li class="L2234" rel="L2234">“They only come from the heart, Jerry. They are worth no more than</li>
<li class="L2235" rel="L2235">that.”</li>
<li class="L2236" rel="L2236"></li>
<li class="L2237" rel="L2237">“Worth no more than that,” repeated Mr. Cruncher. “They ain&#39;t worth</li>
<li class="L2238" rel="L2238">much, then. Whether or no, I won&#39;t be prayed agin, I tell you. I can&#39;t</li>
<li class="L2239" rel="L2239">afford it. I&#39;m not a going to be made unlucky by _your_ sneaking. If</li>
<li class="L2240" rel="L2240">you must go flopping yourself down, flop in favour of your husband and</li>
<li class="L2241" rel="L2241">child, and not in opposition to &#39;em. If I had had any but a unnat&#39;ral</li>
<li class="L2242" rel="L2242">wife, and this poor boy had had any but a unnat&#39;ral mother, I might</li>
<li class="L2243" rel="L2243">have made some money last week instead of being counter-prayed and</li>
<li class="L2244" rel="L2244">countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck.</li>
<li class="L2245" rel="L2245">B-u-u-ust me!” said Mr. Cruncher, who all this time had been putting</li>
<li class="L2246" rel="L2246">on his clothes, “if I ain&#39;t, what with piety and one blowed thing and</li>
<li class="L2247" rel="L2247">another, been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor</li>
<li class="L2248" rel="L2248">devil of a honest tradesman met with! Young Jerry, dress yourself, my</li>
<li class="L2249" rel="L2249">boy, and while I clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and</li>
<li class="L2250" rel="L2250">then, and if you see any signs of more flopping, give me a call. For, I</li>
<li class="L2251" rel="L2251">tell you,” here he addressed his wife once more, “I won&#39;t be gone agin,</li>
<li class="L2252" rel="L2252">in this manner. I am as rickety as a hackney-coach, I&#39;m as sleepy as</li>
<li class="L2253" rel="L2253">laudanum, my lines is strained to that degree that I shouldn&#39;t know, if</li>
<li class="L2254" rel="L2254">it wasn&#39;t for the pain in &#39;em, which was me and which somebody else, yet</li>
<li class="L2255" rel="L2255">I&#39;m none the better for it in pocket; and it&#39;s my suspicion that you&#39;ve</li>
<li class="L2256" rel="L2256">been at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for</li>
<li class="L2257" rel="L2257">it in pocket, and I won&#39;t put up with it, Aggerawayter, and what do you</li>
<li class="L2258" rel="L2258">say now!”</li>
<li class="L2259" rel="L2259"></li>
<li class="L2260" rel="L2260">Growling, in addition, such phrases as “Ah! yes! You&#39;re religious, too.</li>
<li class="L2261" rel="L2261">You wouldn&#39;t put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband</li>
<li class="L2262" rel="L2262">and child, would you? Not you!” and throwing off other sarcastic sparks</li>
<li class="L2263" rel="L2263">from the whirling grindstone of his indignation, Mr. Cruncher betook</li>
<li class="L2264" rel="L2264">himself to his boot-cleaning and his general preparation for business.</li>
<li class="L2265" rel="L2265">In the meantime, his son, whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes,</li>
<li class="L2266" rel="L2266">and whose young eyes stood close by one another, as his father&#39;s did,</li>
<li class="L2267" rel="L2267">kept the required watch upon his mother. He greatly disturbed that poor</li>
<li class="L2268" rel="L2268">woman at intervals, by darting out of his sleeping closet, where he made</li>
<li class="L2269" rel="L2269">his toilet, with a suppressed cry of “You are going to flop, mother.</li>
<li class="L2270" rel="L2270">--Halloa, father!” and, after raising this fictitious alarm, darting in</li>
<li class="L2271" rel="L2271">again with an undutiful grin.</li>
<li class="L2272" rel="L2272"></li>
<li class="L2273" rel="L2273">Mr. Cruncher&#39;s temper was not at all improved when he came to his</li>
<li class="L2274" rel="L2274">breakfast. He resented Mrs. Cruncher&#39;s saying grace with particular</li>
<li class="L2275" rel="L2275">animosity.</li>
<li class="L2276" rel="L2276"></li>
<li class="L2277" rel="L2277">“Now, Aggerawayter! What are you up to? At it again?”</li>
<li class="L2278" rel="L2278"></li>
<li class="L2279" rel="L2279">His wife explained that she had merely “asked a blessing.”</li>
<li class="L2280" rel="L2280"></li>
<li class="L2281" rel="L2281">“Don&#39;t do it!” said Mr. Crunches looking about, as if he rather expected</li>
<li class="L2282" rel="L2282">to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wife&#39;s petitions. “I</li>
<li class="L2283" rel="L2283">ain&#39;t a going to be blest out of house and home. I won&#39;t have my wittles</li>
<li class="L2284" rel="L2284">blest off my table. Keep still!”</li>
<li class="L2285" rel="L2285"></li>
<li class="L2286" rel="L2286">Exceedingly red-eyed and grim, as if he had been up all night at a party</li>
<li class="L2287" rel="L2287">which had taken anything but a convivial turn, Jerry Cruncher worried</li>
<li class="L2288" rel="L2288">his breakfast rather than ate it, growling over it like any four-footed</li>
<li class="L2289" rel="L2289">inmate of a menagerie. Towards nine o&#39;clock he smoothed his ruffled</li>
<li class="L2290" rel="L2290">aspect, and, presenting as respectable and business-like an exterior as</li>
<li class="L2291" rel="L2291">he could overlay his natural self with, issued forth to the occupation</li>
<li class="L2292" rel="L2292">of the day.</li>
<li class="L2293" rel="L2293"></li>
<li class="L2294" rel="L2294">It could scarcely be called a trade, in spite of his favourite</li>
<li class="L2295" rel="L2295">description of himself as “a honest tradesman.” His stock consisted of</li>
<li class="L2296" rel="L2296">a wooden stool, made out of a broken-backed chair cut down, which stool,</li>
<li class="L2297" rel="L2297">young Jerry, walking at his father&#39;s side, carried every morning to</li>
<li class="L2298" rel="L2298">beneath the banking-house window that was nearest Temple Bar: where,</li>
<li class="L2299" rel="L2299">with the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned</li>
<li class="L2300" rel="L2300">from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd-job-man&#39;s</li>
<li class="L2301" rel="L2301">feet, it formed the encampment for the day. On this post of his, Mr.</li>
<li class="L2302" rel="L2302">Cruncher was as well known to Fleet-street and the Temple, as the Bar</li>
<li class="L2303" rel="L2303">itself,--and was almost as in-looking.</li>
<li class="L2304" rel="L2304"></li>
<li class="L2305" rel="L2305">Encamped at a quarter before nine, in good time to touch his</li>
<li class="L2306" rel="L2306">three-cornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to Tellson&#39;s,</li>
<li class="L2307" rel="L2307">Jerry took up his station on this windy March morning, with young Jerry</li>
<li class="L2308" rel="L2308">standing by him, when not engaged in making forays through the Bar, to</li>
<li class="L2309" rel="L2309">inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing</li>
<li class="L2310" rel="L2310">boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose. Father and son,</li>
<li class="L2311" rel="L2311">extremely like each other, looking silently on at the morning traffic</li>
<li class="L2312" rel="L2312">in Fleet-street, with their two heads as near to one another as the two</li>
<li class="L2313" rel="L2313">eyes of each were, bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys.</li>
<li class="L2314" rel="L2314">The resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance, that</li>
<li class="L2315" rel="L2315">the mature Jerry bit and spat out straw, while the twinkling eyes of the</li>
<li class="L2316" rel="L2316">youthful Jerry were as restlessly watchful of him as of everything else</li>
<li class="L2317" rel="L2317">in Fleet-street.</li>
<li class="L2318" rel="L2318"></li>
<li class="L2319" rel="L2319">The head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to Tellson&#39;s</li>
<li class="L2320" rel="L2320">establishment was put through the door, and the word was given:</li>
<li class="L2321" rel="L2321"></li>
<li class="L2322" rel="L2322">“Porter wanted!”</li>
<li class="L2323" rel="L2323"></li>
<li class="L2324" rel="L2324">“Hooray, father! Here&#39;s an early job to begin with!”</li>
<li class="L2325" rel="L2325"></li>
<li class="L2326" rel="L2326">Having thus given his parent God speed, young Jerry seated himself on</li>
<li class="L2327" rel="L2327">the stool, entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father</li>
<li class="L2328" rel="L2328">had been chewing, and cogitated.</li>
<li class="L2329" rel="L2329"></li>
<li class="L2330" rel="L2330">“Al-ways rusty! His fingers is al-ways rusty!” muttered young Jerry.</li>
<li class="L2331" rel="L2331">“Where does my father get all that iron rust from? He don&#39;t get no iron</li>
<li class="L2332" rel="L2332">rust here!”</li>
<li class="L2333" rel="L2333"></li>
<li class="L2334" rel="L2334"></li>
<li class="L2335" rel="L2335"></li>
<li class="L2336" rel="L2336"></li>
<li class="L2337" rel="L2337">II. A Sight</li>
<li class="L2338" rel="L2338"></li>
<li class="L2339" rel="L2339"></li>
<li class="L2340" rel="L2340">“You know the Old Bailey well, no doubt?” said one of the oldest of</li>
<li class="L2341" rel="L2341">clerks to Jerry the messenger.</li>
<li class="L2342" rel="L2342"></li>
<li class="L2343" rel="L2343">“Ye-es, sir,” returned Jerry, in something of a dogged manner. “I _do_</li>
<li class="L2344" rel="L2344">know the Bailey.”</li>
<li class="L2345" rel="L2345"></li>
<li class="L2346" rel="L2346">“Just so. And you know Mr. Lorry.”</li>
<li class="L2347" rel="L2347"></li>
<li class="L2348" rel="L2348">“I know Mr. Lorry, sir, much better than I know the Bailey. Much</li>
<li class="L2349" rel="L2349">better,” said Jerry, not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment</li>
<li class="L2350" rel="L2350">in question, “than I, as a honest tradesman, wish to know the Bailey.”</li>
<li class="L2351" rel="L2351"></li>
<li class="L2352" rel="L2352">“Very well. Find the door where the witnesses go in, and show the</li>
<li class="L2353" rel="L2353">door-keeper this note for Mr. Lorry. He will then let you in.”</li>
<li class="L2354" rel="L2354"></li>
<li class="L2355" rel="L2355">“Into the court, sir?”</li>
<li class="L2356" rel="L2356"></li>
<li class="L2357" rel="L2357">“Into the court.”</li>
<li class="L2358" rel="L2358"></li>
<li class="L2359" rel="L2359">Mr. Cruncher&#39;s eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another, and to</li>
<li class="L2360" rel="L2360">interchange the inquiry, “What do you think of this?”</li>
<li class="L2361" rel="L2361"></li>
<li class="L2362" rel="L2362">“Am I to wait in the court, sir?” he asked, as the result of that</li>
<li class="L2363" rel="L2363">conference.</li>
<li class="L2364" rel="L2364"></li>
<li class="L2365" rel="L2365">“I am going to tell you. The door-keeper will pass the note to Mr.</li>
<li class="L2366" rel="L2366">Lorry, and do you make any gesture that will attract Mr. Lorry&#39;s</li>
<li class="L2367" rel="L2367">attention, and show him where you stand. Then what you have to do, is,</li>
<li class="L2368" rel="L2368">to remain there until he wants you.”</li>
<li class="L2369" rel="L2369"></li>
<li class="L2370" rel="L2370">“Is that all, sir?”</li>
<li class="L2371" rel="L2371"></li>
<li class="L2372" rel="L2372">“That&#39;s all. He wishes to have a messenger at hand. This is to tell him</li>
<li class="L2373" rel="L2373">you are there.”</li>
<li class="L2374" rel="L2374"></li>
<li class="L2375" rel="L2375">As the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note,</li>
<li class="L2376" rel="L2376">Mr. Cruncher, after surveying him in silence until he came to the</li>
<li class="L2377" rel="L2377">blotting-paper stage, remarked:</li>
<li class="L2378" rel="L2378"></li>
<li class="L2379" rel="L2379">“I suppose they&#39;ll be trying Forgeries this morning?”</li>
<li class="L2380" rel="L2380"></li>
<li class="L2381" rel="L2381">“Treason!”</li>
<li class="L2382" rel="L2382"></li>
<li class="L2383" rel="L2383">“That&#39;s quartering,” said Jerry. “Barbarous!”</li>
<li class="L2384" rel="L2384"></li>
<li class="L2385" rel="L2385">“It is the law,” remarked the ancient clerk, turning his surprised</li>
<li class="L2386" rel="L2386">spectacles upon him. “It is the law.”</li>
<li class="L2387" rel="L2387"></li>
<li class="L2388" rel="L2388">“It&#39;s hard in the law to spile a man, I think. It&#39;s hard enough to kill</li>
<li class="L2389" rel="L2389">him, but it&#39;s wery hard to spile him, sir.”</li>
<li class="L2390" rel="L2390"></li>
<li class="L2391" rel="L2391">“Not at all,” retained the ancient clerk. “Speak well of the law. Take</li>
<li class="L2392" rel="L2392">care of your chest and voice, my good friend, and leave the law to take</li>
<li class="L2393" rel="L2393">care of itself. I give you that advice.”</li>
<li class="L2394" rel="L2394"></li>
<li class="L2395" rel="L2395">“It&#39;s the damp, sir, what settles on my chest and voice,” said Jerry. “I</li>
<li class="L2396" rel="L2396">leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is.”</li>
<li class="L2397" rel="L2397"></li>
<li class="L2398" rel="L2398">“Well, well,” said the old clerk; “we all have our various ways of</li>
<li class="L2399" rel="L2399">gaining a livelihood. Some of us have damp ways, and some of us have dry</li>
<li class="L2400" rel="L2400">ways. Here is the letter. Go along.”</li>
<li class="L2401" rel="L2401"></li>
<li class="L2402" rel="L2402">Jerry took the letter, and, remarking to himself with less internal</li>
<li class="L2403" rel="L2403">deference than he made an outward show of, “You are a lean old one,</li>
<li class="L2404" rel="L2404">too,” made his bow, informed his son, in passing, of his destination,</li>
<li class="L2405" rel="L2405">and went his way.</li>
<li class="L2406" rel="L2406"></li>
<li class="L2407" rel="L2407">They hanged at Tyburn, in those days, so the street outside Newgate had</li>
<li class="L2408" rel="L2408">not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it.</li>
<li class="L2409" rel="L2409">But, the gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and</li>
<li class="L2410" rel="L2410">villainy were practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came</li>
<li class="L2411" rel="L2411">into court with the prisoners, and sometimes rushed straight from the</li>
<li class="L2412" rel="L2412">dock at my Lord Chief Justice himself, and pulled him off the bench. It</li>
<li class="L2413" rel="L2413">had more than once happened, that the Judge in the black cap pronounced</li>
<li class="L2414" rel="L2414">his own doom as certainly as the prisoner&#39;s, and even died before him.</li>
<li class="L2415" rel="L2415">For the rest, the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn-yard,</li>
<li class="L2416" rel="L2416">from which pale travellers set out continually, in carts and coaches, on</li>
<li class="L2417" rel="L2417">a violent passage into the other world: traversing some two miles and a</li>
<li class="L2418" rel="L2418">half of public street and road, and shaming few good citizens, if any.</li>
<li class="L2419" rel="L2419">So powerful is use, and so desirable to be good use in the beginning. It</li>
<li class="L2420" rel="L2420">was famous, too, for the pillory, a wise old institution, that inflicted</li>
<li class="L2421" rel="L2421">a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent; also, for</li>
<li class="L2422" rel="L2422">the whipping-post, another dear old institution, very humanising and</li>
<li class="L2423" rel="L2423">softening to behold in action; also, for extensive transactions in</li>
<li class="L2424" rel="L2424">blood-money, another fragment of ancestral wisdom, systematically</li>
<li class="L2425" rel="L2425">leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed</li>
<li class="L2426" rel="L2426">under Heaven. Altogether, the Old Bailey, at that date, was a choice</li>
<li class="L2427" rel="L2427">illustration of the precept, that “Whatever is is right;” an aphorism</li>
<li class="L2428" rel="L2428">that would be as final as it is lazy, did it not include the troublesome</li>
<li class="L2429" rel="L2429">consequence, that nothing that ever was, was wrong.</li>
<li class="L2430" rel="L2430"></li>
<li class="L2431" rel="L2431">Making his way through the tainted crowd, dispersed up and down this</li>
<li class="L2432" rel="L2432">hideous scene of action, with the skill of a man accustomed to make his</li>
<li class="L2433" rel="L2433">way quietly, the messenger found out the door he sought, and handed in</li>
<li class="L2434" rel="L2434">his letter through a trap in it. For, people then paid to see the play</li>
<li class="L2435" rel="L2435">at the Old Bailey, just as they paid to see the play in Bedlam--only the</li>
<li class="L2436" rel="L2436">former entertainment was much the dearer. Therefore, all the Old Bailey</li>
<li class="L2437" rel="L2437">doors were well guarded--except, indeed, the social doors by which the</li>
<li class="L2438" rel="L2438">criminals got there, and those were always left wide open.</li>
<li class="L2439" rel="L2439"></li>
<li class="L2440" rel="L2440">After some delay and demur, the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a</li>
<li class="L2441" rel="L2441">very little way, and allowed Mr. Jerry Cruncher to squeeze himself into</li>
<li class="L2442" rel="L2442">court.</li>
<li class="L2443" rel="L2443"></li>
<li class="L2444" rel="L2444">“What&#39;s on?” he asked, in a whisper, of the man he found himself next</li>
<li class="L2445" rel="L2445">to.</li>
<li class="L2446" rel="L2446"></li>
<li class="L2447" rel="L2447">“Nothing yet.”</li>
<li class="L2448" rel="L2448"></li>
<li class="L2449" rel="L2449">“What&#39;s coming on?”</li>
<li class="L2450" rel="L2450"></li>
<li class="L2451" rel="L2451">“The Treason case.”</li>
<li class="L2452" rel="L2452"></li>
<li class="L2453" rel="L2453">“The quartering one, eh?”</li>
<li class="L2454" rel="L2454"></li>
<li class="L2455" rel="L2455">“Ah!” returned the man, with a relish; “he&#39;ll be drawn on a hurdle to</li>
<li class="L2456" rel="L2456">be half hanged, and then he&#39;ll be taken down and sliced before his own</li>
<li class="L2457" rel="L2457">face, and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on,</li>
<li class="L2458" rel="L2458">and then his head will be chopped off, and he&#39;ll be cut into quarters.</li>
<li class="L2459" rel="L2459">That&#39;s the sentence.”</li>
<li class="L2460" rel="L2460"></li>
<li class="L2461" rel="L2461">“If he&#39;s found Guilty, you mean to say?” Jerry added, by way of proviso.</li>
<li class="L2462" rel="L2462"></li>
<li class="L2463" rel="L2463">“Oh! they&#39;ll find him guilty,” said the other. “Don&#39;t you be afraid of</li>
<li class="L2464" rel="L2464">that.”</li>
<li class="L2465" rel="L2465"></li>
<li class="L2466" rel="L2466">Mr. Cruncher&#39;s attention was here diverted to the door-keeper, whom he</li>
<li class="L2467" rel="L2467">saw making his way to Mr. Lorry, with the note in his hand. Mr. Lorry</li>
<li class="L2468" rel="L2468">sat at a table, among the gentlemen in wigs: not far from a wigged</li>
<li class="L2469" rel="L2469">gentleman, the prisoner&#39;s counsel, who had a great bundle of papers</li>
<li class="L2470" rel="L2470">before him: and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands</li>
<li class="L2471" rel="L2471">in his pockets, whose whole attention, when Mr. Cruncher looked at him</li>
<li class="L2472" rel="L2472">then or afterwards, seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the</li>
<li class="L2473" rel="L2473">court. After some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing</li>
<li class="L2474" rel="L2474">with his hand, Jerry attracted the notice of Mr. Lorry, who had stood up</li>
<li class="L2475" rel="L2475">to look for him, and who quietly nodded and sat down again.</li>
<li class="L2476" rel="L2476"></li>
<li class="L2477" rel="L2477">“What&#39;s _he_ got to do with the case?” asked the man he had spoken with.</li>
<li class="L2478" rel="L2478"></li>
<li class="L2479" rel="L2479">“Blest if I know,” said Jerry.</li>
<li class="L2480" rel="L2480"></li>
<li class="L2481" rel="L2481">“What have _you_ got to do with it, then, if a person may inquire?”</li>
<li class="L2482" rel="L2482"></li>
<li class="L2483" rel="L2483">“Blest if I know that either,” said Jerry.</li>
<li class="L2484" rel="L2484"></li>
<li class="L2485" rel="L2485">The entrance of the Judge, and a consequent great stir and settling</li>
<li class="L2486" rel="L2486">down in the court, stopped the dialogue. Presently, the dock became the</li>
<li class="L2487" rel="L2487">central point of interest. Two gaolers, who had been standing there,</li>
<li class="L2488" rel="L2488">went out, and the prisoner was brought in, and put to the bar.</li>
<li class="L2489" rel="L2489"></li>
<li class="L2490" rel="L2490">Everybody present, except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the</li>
<li class="L2491" rel="L2491">ceiling, stared at him. All the human breath in the place, rolled</li>
<li class="L2492" rel="L2492">at him, like a sea, or a wind, or a fire. Eager faces strained round</li>
<li class="L2493" rel="L2493">pillars and corners, to get a sight of him; spectators in back rows</li>
<li class="L2494" rel="L2494">stood up, not to miss a hair of him; people on the floor of the court,</li>
<li class="L2495" rel="L2495">laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them, to help</li>
<li class="L2496" rel="L2496">themselves, at anybody&#39;s cost, to a view of him--stood a-tiptoe, got</li>
<li class="L2497" rel="L2497">upon ledges, stood upon next to nothing, to see every inch of him.</li>
<li class="L2498" rel="L2498">Conspicuous among these latter, like an animated bit of the spiked wall</li>
<li class="L2499" rel="L2499">of Newgate, Jerry stood: aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a</li>
<li class="L2500" rel="L2500">whet he had taken as he came along, and discharging it to mingle with</li>
<li class="L2501" rel="L2501">the waves of other beer, and gin, and tea, and coffee, and what not,</li>
<li class="L2502" rel="L2502">that flowed at him, and already broke upon the great windows behind him</li>
<li class="L2503" rel="L2503">in an impure mist and rain.</li>
<li class="L2504" rel="L2504"></li>
<li class="L2505" rel="L2505">The object of all this staring and blaring, was a young man of about</li>
<li class="L2506" rel="L2506">five-and-twenty, well-grown and well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek and</li>
<li class="L2507" rel="L2507">a dark eye. His condition was that of a young gentleman. He was plainly</li>
<li class="L2508" rel="L2508">dressed in black, or very dark grey, and his hair, which was long and</li>
<li class="L2509" rel="L2509">dark, was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck; more to be out</li>
<li class="L2510" rel="L2510">of his way than for ornament. As an emotion of the mind will express</li>
<li class="L2511" rel="L2511">itself through any covering of the body, so the paleness which his</li>
<li class="L2512" rel="L2512">situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek, showing the</li>
<li class="L2513" rel="L2513">soul to be stronger than the sun. He was otherwise quite self-possessed,</li>
<li class="L2514" rel="L2514">bowed to the Judge, and stood quiet.</li>
<li class="L2515" rel="L2515"></li>
<li class="L2516" rel="L2516">The sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at,</li>
<li class="L2517" rel="L2517">was not a sort that elevated humanity. Had he stood in peril of a less</li>
<li class="L2518" rel="L2518">horrible sentence--had there been a chance of any one of its savage</li>
<li class="L2519" rel="L2519">details being spared--by just so much would he have lost in his</li>
<li class="L2520" rel="L2520">fascination. The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled,</li>
<li class="L2521" rel="L2521">was the sight; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered</li>
<li class="L2522" rel="L2522">and torn asunder, yielded the sensation. Whatever gloss the various</li>
<li class="L2523" rel="L2523">spectators put upon the interest, according to their several arts and</li>
<li class="L2524" rel="L2524">powers of self-deceit, the interest was, at the root of it, Ogreish.</li>
<li class="L2525" rel="L2525"></li>
<li class="L2526" rel="L2526">Silence in the court! Charles Darnay had yesterday pleaded Not Guilty to</li>
<li class="L2527" rel="L2527">an indictment denouncing him (with infinite jingle and jangle) for that</li>
<li class="L2528" rel="L2528">he was a false traitor to our serene, illustrious, excellent, and so</li>
<li class="L2529" rel="L2529">forth, prince, our Lord the King, by reason of his having, on divers</li>
<li class="L2530" rel="L2530">occasions, and by divers means and ways, assisted Lewis, the French</li>
<li class="L2531" rel="L2531">King, in his wars against our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and</li>
<li class="L2532" rel="L2532">so forth; that was to say, by coming and going, between the dominions of</li>
<li class="L2533" rel="L2533">our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, and those of the</li>
<li class="L2534" rel="L2534">said French Lewis, and wickedly, falsely, traitorously, and otherwise</li>
<li class="L2535" rel="L2535">evil-adverbiously, revealing to the said French Lewis what forces our</li>
<li class="L2536" rel="L2536">said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, had in preparation</li>
<li class="L2537" rel="L2537">to send to Canada and North America. This much, Jerry, with his head</li>
<li class="L2538" rel="L2538">becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it, made out with</li>
<li class="L2539" rel="L2539">huge satisfaction, and so arrived circuitously at the understanding that</li>
<li class="L2540" rel="L2540">the aforesaid, and over and over again aforesaid, Charles Darnay, stood</li>
<li class="L2541" rel="L2541">there before him upon his trial; that the jury were swearing in; and</li>
<li class="L2542" rel="L2542">that Mr. Attorney-General was making ready to speak.</li>
<li class="L2543" rel="L2543"></li>
<li class="L2544" rel="L2544">The accused, who was (and who knew he was) being mentally hanged,</li>
<li class="L2545" rel="L2545">beheaded, and quartered, by everybody there, neither flinched from</li>
<li class="L2546" rel="L2546">the situation, nor assumed any theatrical air in it. He was quiet and</li>
<li class="L2547" rel="L2547">attentive; watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest;</li>
<li class="L2548" rel="L2548">and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him, so</li>
<li class="L2549" rel="L2549">composedly, that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which</li>
<li class="L2550" rel="L2550">it was strewn. The court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with</li>
<li class="L2551" rel="L2551">vinegar, as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever.</li>
<li class="L2552" rel="L2552"></li>
<li class="L2553" rel="L2553">Over the prisoner&#39;s head there was a mirror, to throw the light down</li>
<li class="L2554" rel="L2554">upon him. Crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in</li>
<li class="L2555" rel="L2555">it, and had passed from its surface and this earth&#39;s together. Haunted</li>
<li class="L2556" rel="L2556">in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been, if the</li>
<li class="L2557" rel="L2557">glass could ever have rendered back its reflections, as the ocean is one</li>
<li class="L2558" rel="L2558">day to give up its dead. Some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace</li>
<li class="L2559" rel="L2559">for which it had been reserved, may have struck the prisoner&#39;s mind. Be</li>
<li class="L2560" rel="L2560">that as it may, a change in his position making him conscious of a bar</li>
<li class="L2561" rel="L2561">of light across his face, he looked up; and when he saw the glass his</li>
<li class="L2562" rel="L2562">face flushed, and his right hand pushed the herbs away.</li>
<li class="L2563" rel="L2563"></li>
<li class="L2564" rel="L2564">It happened, that the action turned his face to that side of the court</li>
<li class="L2565" rel="L2565">which was on his left. About on a level with his eyes, there sat,</li>
<li class="L2566" rel="L2566">in that corner of the Judge&#39;s bench, two persons upon whom his look</li>
<li class="L2567" rel="L2567">immediately rested; so immediately, and so much to the changing of his</li>
<li class="L2568" rel="L2568">aspect, that all the eyes that were turned upon him, turned to them.</li>
<li class="L2569" rel="L2569"></li>
<li class="L2570" rel="L2570">The spectators saw in the two figures, a young lady of little more than</li>
<li class="L2571" rel="L2571">twenty, and a gentleman who was evidently her father; a man of a very</li>
<li class="L2572" rel="L2572">remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair,</li>
<li class="L2573" rel="L2573">and a certain indescribable intensity of face: not of an active kind,</li>
<li class="L2574" rel="L2574">but pondering and self-communing. When this expression was upon him, he</li>
<li class="L2575" rel="L2575">looked as if he were old; but when it was stirred and broken up--as</li>
<li class="L2576" rel="L2576">it was now, in a moment, on his speaking to his daughter--he became a</li>
<li class="L2577" rel="L2577">handsome man, not past the prime of life.</li>
<li class="L2578" rel="L2578"></li>
<li class="L2579" rel="L2579">His daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm, as she sat by</li>
<li class="L2580" rel="L2580">him, and the other pressed upon it. She had drawn close to him, in her</li>
<li class="L2581" rel="L2581">dread of the scene, and in her pity for the prisoner. Her forehead had</li>
<li class="L2582" rel="L2582">been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion</li>
<li class="L2583" rel="L2583">that saw nothing but the peril of the accused. This had been so very</li>
<li class="L2584" rel="L2584">noticeable, so very powerfully and naturally shown, that starers who</li>
<li class="L2585" rel="L2585">had had no pity for him were touched by her; and the whisper went about,</li>
<li class="L2586" rel="L2586">“Who are they?”</li>
<li class="L2587" rel="L2587"></li>
<li class="L2588" rel="L2588">Jerry, the messenger, who had made his own observations, in his own</li>
<li class="L2589" rel="L2589">manner, and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his</li>
<li class="L2590" rel="L2590">absorption, stretched his neck to hear who they were. The crowd about</li>
<li class="L2591" rel="L2591">him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant, and</li>
<li class="L2592" rel="L2592">from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back; at last it got</li>
<li class="L2593" rel="L2593">to Jerry:</li>
<li class="L2594" rel="L2594"></li>
<li class="L2595" rel="L2595">“Witnesses.”</li>
<li class="L2596" rel="L2596"></li>

<li class="L2600" rel="L2600"></li>
<li class="L2601" rel="L2601">“Against what side?”</li>
<li class="L2602" rel="L2602"></li>

<li class="L2604" rel="L2604"></li>
<li class="L2605" rel="L2605">The Judge, whose eyes had gone in the general direction, recalled them,</li>
<li class="L2606" rel="L2606">leaned back in his seat, and looked steadily at the man whose life was</li>
<li class="L2607" rel="L2607">in his hand, as Mr. Attorney-General rose to spin the rope, grind the</li>
<li class="L2608" rel="L2608">axe, and hammer the nails into the scaffold.</li>
<li class="L2609" rel="L2609"></li>

<li class="L2613" rel="L2613">III. A Disappointment</li>
<li class="L2614" rel="L2614"></li>
<li class="L2615" rel="L2615"></li>
<li class="L2616" rel="L2616">Mr. Attorney-General had to inform the jury, that the prisoner before</li>
<li class="L2617" rel="L2617">them, though young in years, was old in the treasonable practices which</li>
<li class="L2618" rel="L2618">claimed the forfeit of his life. That this correspondence with the</li>
<li class="L2619" rel="L2619">public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or</li>
<li class="L2620" rel="L2620">even of last year, or of the year before. That, it was certain the</li>
<li class="L2621" rel="L2621">prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and</li>
<li class="L2622" rel="L2622">repassing between France and England, on secret business of which</li>
<li class="L2623" rel="L2623">he could give no honest account. That, if it were in the nature of</li>
<li class="L2624" rel="L2624">traitorous ways to thrive (which happily it never was), the real</li>
<li class="L2625" rel="L2625">wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered.</li>
<li class="L2626" rel="L2626">That Providence, however, had put it into the heart of a person who</li>
<li class="L2627" rel="L2627">was beyond fear and beyond reproach, to ferret out the nature of the</li>
<li class="L2628" rel="L2628">prisoner&#39;s schemes, and, struck with horror, to disclose them to his</li>
<li class="L2629" rel="L2629">Majesty&#39;s Chief Secretary of State and most honourable Privy Council.</li>
<li class="L2630" rel="L2630">That, this patriot would be produced before them. That, his position and</li>
<li class="L2631" rel="L2631">attitude were, on the whole, sublime. That, he had been the prisoner&#39;s</li>
<li class="L2632" rel="L2632">friend, but, at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his</li>
<li class="L2633" rel="L2633">infamy, had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish</li>
<li class="L2634" rel="L2634">in his bosom, on the sacred altar of his country. That, if statues</li>
<li class="L2635" rel="L2635">were decreed in Britain, as in ancient Greece and Rome, to public</li>
<li class="L2636" rel="L2636">benefactors, this shining citizen would assuredly have had one. That, as</li>
<li class="L2637" rel="L2637">they were not so decreed, he probably would not have one. That, Virtue,</li>
<li class="L2638" rel="L2638">as had been observed by the poets (in many passages which he well</li>
<li class="L2639" rel="L2639">knew the jury would have, word for word, at the tips of their tongues;</li>
<li class="L2640" rel="L2640">whereat the jury&#39;s countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that</li>
<li class="L2641" rel="L2641">they knew nothing about the passages), was in a manner contagious; more</li>
<li class="L2642" rel="L2642">especially the bright virtue known as patriotism, or love of country.</li>
<li class="L2643" rel="L2643">That, the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness</li>
<li class="L2644" rel="L2644">for the Crown, to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour, had</li>
<li class="L2645" rel="L2645">communicated itself to the prisoner&#39;s servant, and had engendered in him</li>
<li class="L2646" rel="L2646">a holy determination to examine his master&#39;s table-drawers and pockets,</li>
<li class="L2647" rel="L2647">and secrete his papers. That, he (Mr. Attorney-General) was prepared to</li>
<li class="L2648" rel="L2648">hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant; but that,</li>
<li class="L2649" rel="L2649">in a general way, he preferred him to his (Mr. Attorney-General&#39;s)</li>
<li class="L2650" rel="L2650">brothers and sisters, and honoured him more than his (Mr.</li>
<li class="L2651" rel="L2651">Attorney-General&#39;s) father and mother. That, he called with confidence</li>
<li class="L2652" rel="L2652">on the jury to come and do likewise. That, the evidence of these two</li>
<li class="L2653" rel="L2653">witnesses, coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be</li>
<li class="L2654" rel="L2654">produced, would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of</li>
<li class="L2655" rel="L2655">his Majesty&#39;s forces, and of their disposition and preparation, both by</li>
<li class="L2656" rel="L2656">sea and land, and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed</li>
<li class="L2657" rel="L2657">such information to a hostile power. That, these lists could not be</li>
<li class="L2658" rel="L2658">proved to be in the prisoner&#39;s handwriting; but that it was all the</li>
<li class="L2659" rel="L2659">same; that, indeed, it was rather the better for the prosecution, as</li>
<li class="L2660" rel="L2660">showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions. That, the proof</li>
<li class="L2661" rel="L2661">would go back five years, and would show the prisoner already engaged</li>
<li class="L2662" rel="L2662">in these pernicious missions, within a few weeks before the date of the</li>
<li class="L2663" rel="L2663">very first action fought between the British troops and the Americans.</li>
<li class="L2664" rel="L2664">That, for these reasons, the jury, being a loyal jury (as he knew they</li>
<li class="L2665" rel="L2665">were), and being a responsible jury (as _they_ knew they were), must</li>
<li class="L2666" rel="L2666">positively find the prisoner Guilty, and make an end of him, whether</li>
<li class="L2667" rel="L2667">they liked it or not. That, they never could lay their heads upon their</li>
<li class="L2668" rel="L2668">pillows; that, they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying</li>
<li class="L2669" rel="L2669">their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could endure the notion</li>
<li class="L2670" rel="L2670">of their children laying their heads upon their pillows; in short, that</li>
<li class="L2671" rel="L2671">there never more could be, for them or theirs, any laying of heads upon</li>
<li class="L2672" rel="L2672">pillows at all, unless the prisoner&#39;s head was taken off. That head</li>
<li class="L2673" rel="L2673">Mr. Attorney-General concluded by demanding of them, in the name of</li>
<li class="L2674" rel="L2674">everything he could think of with a round turn in it, and on the faith</li>
<li class="L2675" rel="L2675">of his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as</li>
<li class="L2676" rel="L2676">good as dead and gone.</li>
<li class="L2677" rel="L2677"></li>
<li class="L2678" rel="L2678">When the Attorney-General ceased, a buzz arose in the court as if</li>
<li class="L2679" rel="L2679">a cloud of great blue-flies were swarming about the prisoner, in</li>
<li class="L2680" rel="L2680">anticipation of what he was soon to become. When toned down again, the</li>
<li class="L2681" rel="L2681">unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness-box.</li>
<li class="L2682" rel="L2682"></li>
<li class="L2683" rel="L2683">Mr. Solicitor-General then, following his leader&#39;s lead, examined the</li>
<li class="L2684" rel="L2684">patriot: John Barsad, gentleman, by name. The story of his pure soul was</li>
<li class="L2685" rel="L2685">exactly what Mr. Attorney-General had described it to be--perhaps, if</li>
<li class="L2686" rel="L2686">it had a fault, a little too exactly. Having released his noble bosom</li>
<li class="L2687" rel="L2687">of its burden, he would have modestly withdrawn himself, but that the</li>
<li class="L2688" rel="L2688">wigged gentleman with the papers before him, sitting not far from Mr.</li>
<li class="L2689" rel="L2689">Lorry, begged to ask him a few questions. The wigged gentleman sitting</li>
<li class="L2690" rel="L2690">opposite, still looking at the ceiling of the court.</li>
<li class="L2691" rel="L2691"></li>
<li class="L2692" rel="L2692">Had he ever been a spy himself? No, he scorned the base insinuation.</li>
<li class="L2693" rel="L2693">What did he live upon? His property. Where was his property? He didn&#39;t</li>
<li class="L2694" rel="L2694">precisely remember where it was. What was it? No business of anybody&#39;s.</li>
<li class="L2695" rel="L2695">Had he inherited it? Yes, he had. From whom? Distant relation. Very</li>
<li class="L2696" rel="L2696">distant? Rather. Ever been in prison? Certainly not. Never in a debtors&#39;</li>
<li class="L2697" rel="L2697">prison? Didn&#39;t see what that had to do with it. Never in a debtors&#39;</li>
<li class="L2698" rel="L2698">prison?--Come, once again. Never? Yes. How many times? Two or three</li>
<li class="L2699" rel="L2699">times. Not five or six? Perhaps. Of what profession? Gentleman. Ever</li>
<li class="L2700" rel="L2700">been kicked? Might have been. Frequently? No. Ever kicked downstairs?</li>
<li class="L2701" rel="L2701">Decidedly not; once received a kick on the top of a staircase, and fell</li>
<li class="L2702" rel="L2702">downstairs of his own accord. Kicked on that occasion for cheating at</li>
<li class="L2703" rel="L2703">dice? Something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who</li>
<li class="L2704" rel="L2704">committed the assault, but it was not true. Swear it was not true?</li>
<li class="L2705" rel="L2705">Positively. Ever live by cheating at play? Never. Ever live by play? Not</li>
<li class="L2706" rel="L2706">more than other gentlemen do. Ever borrow money of the prisoner? Yes.</li>
<li class="L2707" rel="L2707">Ever pay him? No. Was not this intimacy with the prisoner, in reality a</li>
<li class="L2708" rel="L2708">very slight one, forced upon the prisoner in coaches, inns, and packets?</li>
<li class="L2709" rel="L2709">No. Sure he saw the prisoner with these lists? Certain. Knew no more</li>
<li class="L2710" rel="L2710">about the lists? No. Had not procured them himself, for instance? No.</li>
<li class="L2711" rel="L2711">Expect to get anything by this evidence? No. Not in regular government</li>
<li class="L2712" rel="L2712">pay and employment, to lay traps? Oh dear no. Or to do anything? Oh dear</li>
<li class="L2713" rel="L2713">no. Swear that? Over and over again. No motives but motives of sheer</li>
<li class="L2714" rel="L2714">patriotism? None whatever.</li>
<li class="L2715" rel="L2715"></li>
<li class="L2716" rel="L2716">The virtuous servant, Roger Cly, swore his way through the case at a</li>
<li class="L2717" rel="L2717">great rate. He had taken service with the prisoner, in good faith and</li>
<li class="L2718" rel="L2718">simplicity, four years ago. He had asked the prisoner, aboard the Calais</li>
<li class="L2719" rel="L2719">packet, if he wanted a handy fellow, and the prisoner had engaged him.</li>
<li class="L2720" rel="L2720">He had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of</li>
<li class="L2721" rel="L2721">charity--never thought of such a thing. He began to have suspicions of</li>
<li class="L2722" rel="L2722">the prisoner, and to keep an eye upon him, soon afterwards. In arranging</li>
<li class="L2723" rel="L2723">his clothes, while travelling, he had seen similar lists to these in the</li>
<li class="L2724" rel="L2724">prisoner&#39;s pockets, over and over again. He had taken these lists from</li>
<li class="L2725" rel="L2725">the drawer of the prisoner&#39;s desk. He had not put them there first. He</li>
<li class="L2726" rel="L2726">had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gentlemen</li>
<li class="L2727" rel="L2727">at Calais, and similar lists to French gentlemen, both at Calais and</li>
<li class="L2728" rel="L2728">Boulogne. He loved his country, and couldn&#39;t bear it, and had given</li>
<li class="L2729" rel="L2729">information. He had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot;</li>
<li class="L2730" rel="L2730">he had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be</li>
<li class="L2731" rel="L2731">only a plated one. He had known the last witness seven or eight years;</li>
<li class="L2732" rel="L2732">that was merely a coincidence. He didn&#39;t call it a particularly curious</li>
<li class="L2733" rel="L2733">coincidence; most coincidences were curious. Neither did he call it a</li>
<li class="L2734" rel="L2734">curious coincidence that true patriotism was _his_ only motive too. He</li>
<li class="L2735" rel="L2735">was a true Briton, and hoped there were many like him.</li>
<li class="L2736" rel="L2736"></li>
<li class="L2737" rel="L2737">The blue-flies buzzed again, and Mr. Attorney-General called Mr. Jarvis</li>
<li class="L2738" rel="L2738">Lorry.</li>
<li class="L2739" rel="L2739"></li>
<li class="L2740" rel="L2740">“Mr. Jarvis Lorry, are you a clerk in Tellson&#39;s bank?”</li>
<li class="L2741" rel="L2741"></li>
<li class="L2742" rel="L2742">“I am.”</li>
<li class="L2743" rel="L2743"></li>
<li class="L2744" rel="L2744">“On a certain Friday night in November one thousand seven hundred and</li>
<li class="L2745" rel="L2745">seventy-five, did business occasion you to travel between London and</li>
<li class="L2746" rel="L2746">Dover by the mail?”</li>
<li class="L2747" rel="L2747"></li>
<li class="L2748" rel="L2748">“It did.”</li>
<li class="L2749" rel="L2749"></li>
<li class="L2750" rel="L2750">“Were there any other passengers in the mail?”</li>
<li class="L2751" rel="L2751"></li>
<li class="L2752" rel="L2752">“Two.”</li>
<li class="L2753" rel="L2753"></li>
<li class="L2754" rel="L2754">“Did they alight on the road in the course of the night?”</li>
<li class="L2755" rel="L2755"></li>
<li class="L2756" rel="L2756">“They did.”</li>
<li class="L2757" rel="L2757"></li>
<li class="L2758" rel="L2758">“Mr. Lorry, look upon the prisoner. Was he one of those two passengers?”</li>
<li class="L2759" rel="L2759"></li>
<li class="L2760" rel="L2760">“I cannot undertake to say that he was.”</li>
<li class="L2761" rel="L2761"></li>
<li class="L2762" rel="L2762">“Does he resemble either of these two passengers?”</li>
<li class="L2763" rel="L2763"></li>
<li class="L2764" rel="L2764">“Both were so wrapped up, and the night was so dark, and we were all so</li>
<li class="L2765" rel="L2765">reserved, that I cannot undertake to say even that.”</li>
<li class="L2766" rel="L2766"></li>
<li class="L2767" rel="L2767">“Mr. Lorry, look again upon the prisoner. Supposing him wrapped up as</li>
<li class="L2768" rel="L2768">those two passengers were, is there anything in his bulk and stature to</li>
<li class="L2769" rel="L2769">render it unlikely that he was one of them?”</li>
<li class="L2770" rel="L2770"></li>
<li class="L2771" rel="L2771">“No.”</li>
<li class="L2772" rel="L2772"></li>
<li class="L2773" rel="L2773">“You will not swear, Mr. Lorry, that he was not one of them?”</li>
<li class="L2774" rel="L2774"></li>
<li class="L2775" rel="L2775">“No.”</li>
<li class="L2776" rel="L2776"></li>
<li class="L2777" rel="L2777">“So at least you say he may have been one of them?”</li>
<li class="L2778" rel="L2778"></li>
<li class="L2779" rel="L2779">“Yes. Except that I remember them both to have been--like</li>
<li class="L2780" rel="L2780">myself--timorous of highwaymen, and the prisoner has not a timorous</li>
<li class="L2781" rel="L2781">air.”</li>
<li class="L2782" rel="L2782"></li>
<li class="L2783" rel="L2783">“Did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity, Mr. Lorry?”</li>
<li class="L2784" rel="L2784"></li>
<li class="L2785" rel="L2785">“I certainly have seen that.”</li>
<li class="L2786" rel="L2786"></li>
<li class="L2787" rel="L2787">“Mr. Lorry, look once more upon the prisoner. Have you seen him, to your</li>
<li class="L2788" rel="L2788">certain knowledge, before?”</li>
<li class="L2789" rel="L2789"></li>
<li class="L2790" rel="L2790">“I have.”</li>
<li class="L2791" rel="L2791"></li>
<li class="L2792" rel="L2792">“When?”</li>
<li class="L2793" rel="L2793"></li>
<li class="L2794" rel="L2794">“I was returning from France a few days afterwards, and, at Calais, the</li>
<li class="L2795" rel="L2795">prisoner came on board the packet-ship in which I returned, and made the</li>
<li class="L2796" rel="L2796">voyage with me.”</li>
<li class="L2797" rel="L2797"></li>
<li class="L2798" rel="L2798">“At what hour did he come on board?”</li>
<li class="L2799" rel="L2799"></li>
<li class="L2800" rel="L2800">“At a little after midnight.”</li>
<li class="L2801" rel="L2801"></li>
<li class="L2802" rel="L2802">“In the dead of the night. Was he the only passenger who came on board</li>
<li class="L2803" rel="L2803">at that untimely hour?”</li>
<li class="L2804" rel="L2804"></li>
<li class="L2805" rel="L2805">“He happened to be the only one.”</li>
<li class="L2806" rel="L2806"></li>
<li class="L2807" rel="L2807">“Never mind about &#39;happening,&#39; Mr. Lorry. He was the only passenger who</li>
<li class="L2808" rel="L2808">came on board in the dead of the night?”</li>
<li class="L2809" rel="L2809"></li>
<li class="L2810" rel="L2810">“He was.”</li>
<li class="L2811" rel="L2811"></li>
<li class="L2812" rel="L2812">“Were you travelling alone, Mr. Lorry, or with any companion?”</li>
<li class="L2813" rel="L2813"></li>
<li class="L2814" rel="L2814">“With two companions. A gentleman and lady. They are here.”</li>
<li class="L2815" rel="L2815"></li>
<li class="L2816" rel="L2816">“They are here. Had you any conversation with the prisoner?”</li>
<li class="L2817" rel="L2817"></li>
<li class="L2818" rel="L2818">“Hardly any. The weather was stormy, and the passage long and rough, and</li>
<li class="L2819" rel="L2819">I lay on a sofa, almost from shore to shore.”</li>
<li class="L2820" rel="L2820"></li>
<li class="L2821" rel="L2821">“Miss Manette!”</li>
<li class="L2822" rel="L2822"></li>
<li class="L2823" rel="L2823">The young lady, to whom all eyes had been turned before, and were now</li>
<li class="L2824" rel="L2824">turned again, stood up where she had sat. Her father rose with her, and</li>
<li class="L2825" rel="L2825">kept her hand drawn through his arm.</li>
<li class="L2826" rel="L2826"></li>
<li class="L2827" rel="L2827">“Miss Manette, look upon the prisoner.”</li>
<li class="L2828" rel="L2828"></li>
<li class="L2829" rel="L2829">To be confronted with such pity, and such earnest youth and beauty, was</li>
<li class="L2830" rel="L2830">far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd.</li>
<li class="L2831" rel="L2831">Standing, as it were, apart with her on the edge of his grave, not all</li>
<li class="L2832" rel="L2832">the staring curiosity that looked on, could, for the moment, nerve him</li>
<li class="L2833" rel="L2833">to remain quite still. His hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs</li>
<li class="L2834" rel="L2834">before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden; and his efforts</li>
<li class="L2835" rel="L2835">to control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour</li>
<li class="L2836" rel="L2836">rushed to his heart. The buzz of the great flies was loud again.</li>
<li class="L2837" rel="L2837"></li>
<li class="L2838" rel="L2838">“Miss Manette, have you seen the prisoner before?”</li>
<li class="L2839" rel="L2839"></li>
<li class="L2840" rel="L2840">“Yes, sir.”</li>
<li class="L2841" rel="L2841"></li>
<li class="L2842" rel="L2842">“Where?”</li>
<li class="L2843" rel="L2843"></li>
<li class="L2844" rel="L2844">“On board of the packet-ship just now referred to, sir, and on the same</li>
<li class="L2845" rel="L2845">occasion.”</li>
<li class="L2846" rel="L2846"></li>
<li class="L2847" rel="L2847">“You are the young lady just now referred to?”</li>
<li class="L2848" rel="L2848"></li>
<li class="L2849" rel="L2849">“O! most unhappily, I am!”</li>
<li class="L2850" rel="L2850"></li>
<li class="L2851" rel="L2851">The plaintive tone of her compassion merged into the less musical voice</li>
<li class="L2852" rel="L2852">of the Judge, as he said something fiercely: “Answer the questions put</li>
<li class="L2853" rel="L2853">to you, and make no remark upon them.”</li>
<li class="L2854" rel="L2854"></li>
<li class="L2855" rel="L2855">“Miss Manette, had you any conversation with the prisoner on that</li>
<li class="L2856" rel="L2856">passage across the Channel?”</li>
<li class="L2857" rel="L2857"></li>
<li class="L2858" rel="L2858">“Yes, sir.”</li>
<li class="L2859" rel="L2859"></li>
<li class="L2860" rel="L2860">“Recall it.”</li>
<li class="L2861" rel="L2861"></li>
<li class="L2862" rel="L2862">In the midst of a profound stillness, she faintly began: “When the</li>
<li class="L2863" rel="L2863">gentleman came on board--”</li>
<li class="L2864" rel="L2864"></li>
<li class="L2865" rel="L2865">“Do you mean the prisoner?” inquired the Judge, knitting his brows.</li>
<li class="L2866" rel="L2866"></li>
<li class="L2867" rel="L2867">“Yes, my Lord.”</li>
<li class="L2868" rel="L2868"></li>
<li class="L2869" rel="L2869">“Then say the prisoner.”</li>
<li class="L2870" rel="L2870"></li>
<li class="L2871" rel="L2871">“When the prisoner came on board, he noticed that my father,” turning</li>
<li class="L2872" rel="L2872">her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her, “was much fatigued</li>
<li class="L2873" rel="L2873">and in a very weak state of health. My father was so reduced that I was</li>
<li class="L2874" rel="L2874">afraid to take him out of the air, and I had made a bed for him on the</li>
<li class="L2875" rel="L2875">deck near the cabin steps, and I sat on the deck at his side to take</li>
<li class="L2876" rel="L2876">care of him. There were no other passengers that night, but we four.</li>
<li class="L2877" rel="L2877">The prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how I could</li>
<li class="L2878" rel="L2878">shelter my father from the wind and weather, better than I had done. I</li>
<li class="L2879" rel="L2879">had not known how to do it well, not understanding how the wind would</li>
<li class="L2880" rel="L2880">set when we were out of the harbour. He did it for me. He expressed</li>
<li class="L2881" rel="L2881">great gentleness and kindness for my father&#39;s state, and I am sure he</li>
<li class="L2882" rel="L2882">felt it. That was the manner of our beginning to speak together.”</li>
<li class="L2883" rel="L2883"></li>
<li class="L2884" rel="L2884">“Let me interrupt you for a moment. Had he come on board alone?”</li>
<li class="L2885" rel="L2885"></li>
<li class="L2886" rel="L2886">“No.”</li>
<li class="L2887" rel="L2887"></li>
<li class="L2888" rel="L2888">“How many were with him?”</li>
<li class="L2889" rel="L2889"></li>
<li class="L2890" rel="L2890">“Two French gentlemen.”</li>
<li class="L2891" rel="L2891"></li>
<li class="L2892" rel="L2892">“Had they conferred together?”</li>
<li class="L2893" rel="L2893"></li>
<li class="L2894" rel="L2894">“They had conferred together until the last moment, when it was</li>
<li class="L2895" rel="L2895">necessary for the French gentlemen to be landed in their boat.”</li>
<li class="L2896" rel="L2896"></li>
<li class="L2897" rel="L2897">“Had any papers been handed about among them, similar to these lists?”</li>
<li class="L2898" rel="L2898"></li>
<li class="L2899" rel="L2899">“Some papers had been handed about among them, but I don&#39;t know what</li>
<li class="L2900" rel="L2900">papers.”</li>
<li class="L2901" rel="L2901"></li>
<li class="L2902" rel="L2902">“Like these in shape and size?”</li>
<li class="L2903" rel="L2903"></li>
<li class="L2904" rel="L2904">“Possibly, but indeed I don&#39;t know, although they stood whispering very</li>
<li class="L2905" rel="L2905">near to me: because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the</li>
<li class="L2906" rel="L2906">light of the lamp that was hanging there; it was a dull lamp, and they</li>
<li class="L2907" rel="L2907">spoke very low, and I did not hear what they said, and saw only that</li>
<li class="L2908" rel="L2908">they looked at papers.”</li>
<li class="L2909" rel="L2909"></li>
<li class="L2910" rel="L2910">“Now, to the prisoner&#39;s conversation, Miss Manette.”</li>
<li class="L2911" rel="L2911"></li>
<li class="L2912" rel="L2912">“The prisoner was as open in his confidence with me--which arose out</li>
<li class="L2913" rel="L2913">of my helpless situation--as he was kind, and good, and useful to my</li>
<li class="L2914" rel="L2914">father. I hope,” bursting into tears, “I may not repay him by doing him</li>
<li class="L2915" rel="L2915">harm to-day.”</li>
<li class="L2916" rel="L2916"></li>
<li class="L2917" rel="L2917">Buzzing from the blue-flies.</li>
<li class="L2918" rel="L2918"></li>
<li class="L2919" rel="L2919">“Miss Manette, if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that</li>
<li class="L2920" rel="L2920">you give the evidence which it is your duty to give--which you must</li>
<li class="L2921" rel="L2921">give--and which you cannot escape from giving--with great unwillingness,</li>
<li class="L2922" rel="L2922">he is the only person present in that condition. Please to go on.”</li>
<li class="L2923" rel="L2923"></li>
<li class="L2924" rel="L2924">“He told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and</li>
<li class="L2925" rel="L2925">difficult nature, which might get people into trouble, and that he was</li>
<li class="L2926" rel="L2926">therefore travelling under an assumed name. He said that this business</li>
<li class="L2927" rel="L2927">had, within a few days, taken him to France, and might, at intervals,</li>
<li class="L2928" rel="L2928">take him backwards and forwards between France and England for a long</li>
<li class="L2929" rel="L2929">time to come.”</li>
<li class="L2930" rel="L2930"></li>
<li class="L2931" rel="L2931">“Did he say anything about America, Miss Manette? Be particular.”</li>
<li class="L2932" rel="L2932"></li>
<li class="L2933" rel="L2933">“He tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen, and he said</li>
<li class="L2934" rel="L2934">that, so far as he could judge, it was a wrong and foolish one on</li>
<li class="L2935" rel="L2935">England&#39;s part. He added, in a jesting way, that perhaps George</li>
<li class="L2936" rel="L2936">Washington might gain almost as great a name in history as George the</li>
<li class="L2937" rel="L2937">Third. But there was no harm in his way of saying this: it was said</li>
<li class="L2938" rel="L2938">laughingly, and to beguile the time.”</li>
<li class="L2939" rel="L2939"></li>
<li class="L2940" rel="L2940">Any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in</li>
<li class="L2941" rel="L2941">a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed, will be</li>
<li class="L2942" rel="L2942">unconsciously imitated by the spectators. Her forehead was painfully</li>
<li class="L2943" rel="L2943">anxious and intent as she gave this evidence, and, in the pauses when</li>
<li class="L2944" rel="L2944">she stopped for the Judge to write it down, watched its effect upon</li>
<li class="L2945" rel="L2945">the counsel for and against. Among the lookers-on there was the same</li>
<li class="L2946" rel="L2946">expression in all quarters of the court; insomuch, that a great majority</li>
<li class="L2947" rel="L2947">of the foreheads there, might have been mirrors reflecting the witness,</li>
<li class="L2948" rel="L2948">when the Judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous</li>
<li class="L2949" rel="L2949">heresy about George Washington.</li>
<li class="L2950" rel="L2950"></li>
<li class="L2951" rel="L2951">Mr. Attorney-General now signified to my Lord, that he deemed it</li>
<li class="L2952" rel="L2952">necessary, as a matter of precaution and form, to call the young lady&#39;s</li>
<li class="L2953" rel="L2953">father, Doctor Manette. Who was called accordingly.</li>
<li class="L2954" rel="L2954"></li>
<li class="L2955" rel="L2955">“Doctor Manette, look upon the prisoner. Have you ever seen him before?”</li>
<li class="L2956" rel="L2956"></li>
<li class="L2957" rel="L2957">“Once. When he called at my lodgings in London. Some three years, or</li>
<li class="L2958" rel="L2958">three years and a half ago.”</li>
<li class="L2959" rel="L2959"></li>
<li class="L2960" rel="L2960">“Can you identify him as your fellow-passenger on board the packet, or</li>
<li class="L2961" rel="L2961">speak to his conversation with your daughter?”</li>
<li class="L2962" rel="L2962"></li>
<li class="L2963" rel="L2963">“Sir, I can do neither.”</li>
<li class="L2964" rel="L2964"></li>
<li class="L2965" rel="L2965">“Is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do</li>
<li class="L2966" rel="L2966">either?”</li>
<li class="L2967" rel="L2967"></li>
<li class="L2968" rel="L2968">He answered, in a low voice, “There is.”</li>
<li class="L2969" rel="L2969"></li>
<li class="L2970" rel="L2970">“Has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment, without</li>
<li class="L2971" rel="L2971">trial, or even accusation, in your native country, Doctor Manette?”</li>
<li class="L2972" rel="L2972"></li>
<li class="L2973" rel="L2973">He answered, in a tone that went to every heart, “A long imprisonment.”</li>
<li class="L2974" rel="L2974"></li>
<li class="L2975" rel="L2975">“Were you newly released on the occasion in question?”</li>
<li class="L2976" rel="L2976"></li>
<li class="L2977" rel="L2977">“They tell me so.”</li>
<li class="L2978" rel="L2978"></li>
<li class="L2979" rel="L2979">“Have you no remembrance of the occasion?”</li>
<li class="L2980" rel="L2980"></li>
<li class="L2981" rel="L2981">“None. My mind is a blank, from some time--I cannot even say what</li>
<li class="L2982" rel="L2982">time--when I employed myself, in my captivity, in making shoes, to the</li>
<li class="L2983" rel="L2983">time when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter</li>
<li class="L2984" rel="L2984">here. She had become familiar to me, when a gracious God restored</li>
<li class="L2985" rel="L2985">my faculties; but, I am quite unable even to say how she had become</li>
<li class="L2986" rel="L2986">familiar. I have no remembrance of the process.”</li>
<li class="L2987" rel="L2987"></li>
<li class="L2988" rel="L2988">Mr. Attorney-General sat down, and the father and daughter sat down</li>
<li class="L2989" rel="L2989">together.</li>
<li class="L2990" rel="L2990"></li>
<li class="L2991" rel="L2991">A singular circumstance then arose in the case. The object in hand being</li>
<li class="L2992" rel="L2992">to show that the prisoner went down, with some fellow-plotter untracked,</li>
<li class="L2993" rel="L2993">in the Dover mail on that Friday night in November five years ago, and</li>
<li class="L2994" rel="L2994">got out of the mail in the night, as a blind, at a place where he did</li>
<li class="L2995" rel="L2995">not remain, but from which he travelled back some dozen miles or more,</li>
<li class="L2996" rel="L2996">to a garrison and dockyard, and there collected information; a witness</li>
<li class="L2997" rel="L2997">was called to identify him as having been at the precise time required,</li>
<li class="L2998" rel="L2998">in the coffee-room of an hotel in that garrison-and-dockyard town,</li>
<li class="L2999" rel="L2999">waiting for another person. The prisoner&#39;s counsel was cross-examining</li>
<li class="L3000" rel="L3000">this witness with no result, except that he had never seen the prisoner</li>
<li class="L3001" rel="L3001">on any other occasion, when the wigged gentleman who had all this time</li>
<li class="L3002" rel="L3002">been looking at the ceiling of the court, wrote a word or two on a</li>
<li class="L3003" rel="L3003">little piece of paper, screwed it up, and tossed it to him. Opening</li>
<li class="L3004" rel="L3004">this piece of paper in the next pause, the counsel looked with great</li>
<li class="L3005" rel="L3005">attention and curiosity at the prisoner.</li>
<li class="L3006" rel="L3006"></li>
<li class="L3007" rel="L3007">“You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner?”</li>
<li class="L3008" rel="L3008"></li>
<li class="L3009" rel="L3009">The witness was quite sure.</li>
<li class="L3010" rel="L3010"></li>
<li class="L3011" rel="L3011">“Did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner?”</li>
<li class="L3012" rel="L3012"></li>
<li class="L3013" rel="L3013">Not so like (the witness said) as that he could be mistaken.</li>
<li class="L3014" rel="L3014"></li>
<li class="L3015" rel="L3015">“Look well upon that gentleman, my learned friend there,” pointing</li>
<li class="L3016" rel="L3016">to him who had tossed the paper over, “and then look well upon the</li>
<li class="L3017" rel="L3017">prisoner. How say you? Are they very like each other?”</li>
<li class="L3018" rel="L3018"></li>
<li class="L3019" rel="L3019">Allowing for my learned friend&#39;s appearance being careless and slovenly</li>
<li class="L3020" rel="L3020">if not debauched, they were sufficiently like each other to surprise,</li>
<li class="L3021" rel="L3021">not only the witness, but everybody present, when they were thus brought</li>
<li class="L3022" rel="L3022">into comparison. My Lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside</li>
<li class="L3023" rel="L3023">his wig, and giving no very gracious consent, the likeness became</li>
<li class="L3024" rel="L3024">much more remarkable. My Lord inquired of Mr. Stryver (the prisoner&#39;s</li>
<li class="L3025" rel="L3025">counsel), whether they were next to try Mr. Carton (name of my learned</li>
<li class="L3026" rel="L3026">friend) for treason? But, Mr. Stryver replied to my Lord, no; but he</li>
<li class="L3027" rel="L3027">would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once, might</li>
<li class="L3028" rel="L3028">happen twice; whether he would have been so confident if he had seen</li>
<li class="L3029" rel="L3029">this illustration of his rashness sooner, whether he would be so</li>
<li class="L3030" rel="L3030">confident, having seen it; and more. The upshot of which, was, to smash</li>
<li class="L3031" rel="L3031">this witness like a crockery vessel, and shiver his part of the case to</li>
<li class="L3032" rel="L3032">useless lumber.</li>
<li class="L3033" rel="L3033"></li>
<li class="L3034" rel="L3034">Mr. Cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his</li>
<li class="L3035" rel="L3035">fingers in his following of the evidence. He had now to attend while Mr.</li>
<li class="L3036" rel="L3036">Stryver fitted the prisoner&#39;s case on the jury, like a compact suit</li>
<li class="L3037" rel="L3037">of clothes; showing them how the patriot, Barsad, was a hired spy and</li>
<li class="L3038" rel="L3038">traitor, an unblushing trafficker in blood, and one of the greatest</li>
<li class="L3039" rel="L3039">scoundrels upon earth since accursed Judas--which he certainly did look</li>
<li class="L3040" rel="L3040">rather like. How the virtuous servant, Cly, was his friend and partner,</li>
<li class="L3041" rel="L3041">and was worthy to be; how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false</li>
<li class="L3042" rel="L3042">swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim, because some family</li>
<li class="L3043" rel="L3043">affairs in France, he being of French extraction, did require his making</li>
<li class="L3044" rel="L3044">those passages across the Channel--though what those affairs were, a</li>
<li class="L3045" rel="L3045">consideration for others who were near and dear to him, forbade him,</li>
<li class="L3046" rel="L3046">even for his life, to disclose. How the evidence that had been warped</li>
<li class="L3047" rel="L3047">and wrested from the young lady, whose anguish in giving it they</li>
<li class="L3048" rel="L3048">had witnessed, came to nothing, involving the mere little innocent</li>
<li class="L3049" rel="L3049">gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman</li>
<li class="L3050" rel="L3050">and young lady so thrown together;--with the exception of that</li>
<li class="L3051" rel="L3051">reference to George Washington, which was altogether too extravagant and</li>
<li class="L3052" rel="L3052">impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke.</li>
<li class="L3053" rel="L3053">How it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this</li>
<li class="L3054" rel="L3054">attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies</li>
<li class="L3055" rel="L3055">and fears, and therefore Mr. Attorney-General had made the most of it;</li>
<li class="L3056" rel="L3056">how, nevertheless, it rested upon nothing, save that vile and infamous</li>
<li class="L3057" rel="L3057">character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases, and of which the</li>
<li class="L3058" rel="L3058">State Trials of this country were full. But, there my Lord interposed</li>
<li class="L3059" rel="L3059">(with as grave a face as if it had not been true), saying that he could</li>
<li class="L3060" rel="L3060">not sit upon that Bench and suffer those allusions.</li>
<li class="L3061" rel="L3061"></li>
<li class="L3062" rel="L3062">Mr. Stryver then called his few witnesses, and Mr. Cruncher had next to</li>
<li class="L3063" rel="L3063">attend while Mr. Attorney-General turned the whole suit of clothes Mr.</li>
<li class="L3064" rel="L3064">Stryver had fitted on the jury, inside out; showing how Barsad and</li>
<li class="L3065" rel="L3065">Cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them, and the</li>
<li class="L3066" rel="L3066">prisoner a hundred times worse. Lastly, came my Lord himself, turning</li>
<li class="L3067" rel="L3067">the suit of clothes, now inside out, now outside in, but on the whole</li>
<li class="L3068" rel="L3068">decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave-clothes for the prisoner.</li>
<li class="L3069" rel="L3069"></li>
<li class="L3070" rel="L3070">And now, the jury turned to consider, and the great flies swarmed again.</li>
<li class="L3071" rel="L3071"></li>
<li class="L3072" rel="L3072">Mr. Carton, who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court,</li>
<li class="L3073" rel="L3073">changed neither his place nor his attitude, even in this excitement.</li>
<li class="L3074" rel="L3074">While his learned friend, Mr. Stryver, massing his papers before him,</li>
<li class="L3075" rel="L3075">whispered with those who sat near, and from time to time glanced</li>
<li class="L3076" rel="L3076">anxiously at the jury; while all the spectators moved more or less, and</li>
<li class="L3077" rel="L3077">grouped themselves anew; while even my Lord himself arose from his seat,</li>
<li class="L3078" rel="L3078">and slowly paced up and down his platform, not unattended by a suspicion</li>
<li class="L3079" rel="L3079">in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish; this one man</li>
<li class="L3080" rel="L3080">sat leaning back, with his torn gown half off him, his untidy wig put</li>
<li class="L3081" rel="L3081">on just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal, his</li>
<li class="L3082" rel="L3082">hands in his pockets, and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all</li>
<li class="L3083" rel="L3083">day. Something especially reckless in his demeanour, not only gave him</li>
<li class="L3084" rel="L3084">a disreputable look, but so diminished the strong resemblance he</li>
<li class="L3085" rel="L3085">undoubtedly bore to the prisoner (which his momentary earnestness,</li>
<li class="L3086" rel="L3086">when they were compared together, had strengthened), that many of the</li>
<li class="L3087" rel="L3087">lookers-on, taking note of him now, said to one another they would</li>
<li class="L3088" rel="L3088">hardly have thought the two were so alike. Mr. Cruncher made the</li>
<li class="L3089" rel="L3089">observation to his next neighbour, and added, “I&#39;d hold half a guinea</li>
<li class="L3090" rel="L3090">that _he_ don&#39;t get no law-work to do. Don&#39;t look like the sort of one</li>
<li class="L3091" rel="L3091">to get any, do he?”</li>
<li class="L3092" rel="L3092"></li>
<li class="L3093" rel="L3093">Yet, this Mr. Carton took in more of the details of the scene than he</li>
<li class="L3094" rel="L3094">appeared to take in; for now, when Miss Manette&#39;s head dropped upon</li>
<li class="L3095" rel="L3095">her father&#39;s breast, he was the first to see it, and to say audibly:</li>
<li class="L3096" rel="L3096">“Officer! look to that young lady. Help the gentleman to take her out.</li>
<li class="L3097" rel="L3097">Don&#39;t you see she will fall!”</li>
<li class="L3098" rel="L3098"></li>
<li class="L3099" rel="L3099">There was much commiseration for her as she was removed, and much</li>
<li class="L3100" rel="L3100">sympathy with her father. It had evidently been a great distress to</li>
<li class="L3101" rel="L3101">him, to have the days of his imprisonment recalled. He had shown</li>
<li class="L3102" rel="L3102">strong internal agitation when he was questioned, and that pondering or</li>
<li class="L3103" rel="L3103">brooding look which made him old, had been upon him, like a heavy cloud,</li>
<li class="L3104" rel="L3104">ever since. As he passed out, the jury, who had turned back and paused a</li>
<li class="L3105" rel="L3105">moment, spoke, through their foreman.</li>
<li class="L3106" rel="L3106"></li>
<li class="L3107" rel="L3107">They were not agreed, and wished to retire. My Lord (perhaps with George</li>
<li class="L3108" rel="L3108">Washington on his mind) showed some surprise that they were not agreed,</li>
<li class="L3109" rel="L3109">but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward,</li>
<li class="L3110" rel="L3110">and retired himself. The trial had lasted all day, and the lamps in</li>
<li class="L3111" rel="L3111">the court were now being lighted. It began to be rumoured that the</li>
<li class="L3112" rel="L3112">jury would be out a long while. The spectators dropped off to get</li>
<li class="L3113" rel="L3113">refreshment, and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock, and sat</li>
<li class="L3114" rel="L3114">down.</li>
<li class="L3115" rel="L3115"></li>
<li class="L3116" rel="L3116">Mr. Lorry, who had gone out when the young lady and her father went out,</li>
<li class="L3117" rel="L3117">now reappeared, and beckoned to Jerry: who, in the slackened interest,</li>
<li class="L3118" rel="L3118">could easily get near him.</li>
<li class="L3119" rel="L3119"></li>
<li class="L3120" rel="L3120">“Jerry, if you wish to take something to eat, you can. But, keep in the</li>
<li class="L3121" rel="L3121">way. You will be sure to hear when the jury come in. Don&#39;t be a moment</li>
<li class="L3122" rel="L3122">behind them, for I want you to take the verdict back to the bank. You</li>
<li class="L3123" rel="L3123">are the quickest messenger I know, and will get to Temple Bar long</li>
<li class="L3124" rel="L3124">before I can.”</li>
<li class="L3125" rel="L3125"></li>
<li class="L3126" rel="L3126">Jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle, and he knuckled it in</li>
<li class="L3127" rel="L3127">acknowledgment of this communication and a shilling. Mr. Carton came up</li>
<li class="L3128" rel="L3128">at the moment, and touched Mr. Lorry on the arm.</li>
<li class="L3129" rel="L3129"></li>
<li class="L3130" rel="L3130">“How is the young lady?”</li>
<li class="L3131" rel="L3131"></li>
<li class="L3132" rel="L3132">“She is greatly distressed; but her father is comforting her, and she</li>
<li class="L3133" rel="L3133">feels the better for being out of court.”</li>
<li class="L3134" rel="L3134"></li>
<li class="L3135" rel="L3135">“I&#39;ll tell the prisoner so. It won&#39;t do for a respectable bank gentleman</li>
<li class="L3136" rel="L3136">like you, to be seen speaking to him publicly, you know.”</li>
<li class="L3137" rel="L3137"></li>
<li class="L3138" rel="L3138">Mr. Lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the point</li>
<li class="L3139" rel="L3139">in his mind, and Mr. Carton made his way to the outside of the bar.</li>
<li class="L3140" rel="L3140">The way out of court lay in that direction, and Jerry followed him, all</li>
<li class="L3141" rel="L3141">eyes, ears, and spikes.</li>
<li class="L3142" rel="L3142"></li>
<li class="L3143" rel="L3143">“Mr. Darnay!”</li>
<li class="L3144" rel="L3144"></li>
<li class="L3145" rel="L3145">The prisoner came forward directly.</li>
<li class="L3146" rel="L3146"></li>
<li class="L3147" rel="L3147">“You will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness, Miss Manette. She</li>
<li class="L3148" rel="L3148">will do very well. You have seen the worst of her agitation.”</li>
<li class="L3149" rel="L3149"></li>
<li class="L3150" rel="L3150">“I am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it. Could you tell her so</li>
<li class="L3151" rel="L3151">for me, with my fervent acknowledgments?”</li>
<li class="L3152" rel="L3152"></li>
<li class="L3153" rel="L3153">“Yes, I could. I will, if you ask it.”</li>
<li class="L3154" rel="L3154"></li>
<li class="L3155" rel="L3155">Mr. Carton&#39;s manner was so careless as to be almost insolent. He stood,</li>
<li class="L3156" rel="L3156">half turned from the prisoner, lounging with his elbow against the bar.</li>
<li class="L3157" rel="L3157"></li>
<li class="L3158" rel="L3158">“I do ask it. Accept my cordial thanks.”</li>
<li class="L3159" rel="L3159"></li>
<li class="L3160" rel="L3160">“What,” said Carton, still only half turned towards him, “do you expect,</li>
<li class="L3161" rel="L3161">Mr. Darnay?”</li>
<li class="L3162" rel="L3162"></li>
<li class="L3163" rel="L3163">“The worst.”</li>
<li class="L3164" rel="L3164"></li>
<li class="L3165" rel="L3165">“It&#39;s the wisest thing to expect, and the likeliest. But I think their</li>
<li class="L3166" rel="L3166">withdrawing is in your favour.”</li>
<li class="L3167" rel="L3167"></li>
<li class="L3168" rel="L3168">Loitering on the way out of court not being allowed, Jerry heard no</li>
<li class="L3169" rel="L3169">more: but left them--so like each other in feature, so unlike each other</li>
<li class="L3170" rel="L3170">in manner--standing side by side, both reflected in the glass above</li>
<li class="L3171" rel="L3171">them.</li>
<li class="L3172" rel="L3172"></li>
<li class="L3173" rel="L3173">An hour and a half limped heavily away in the thief-and-rascal crowded</li>
<li class="L3174" rel="L3174">passages below, even though assisted off with mutton pies and ale.</li>
<li class="L3175" rel="L3175">The hoarse messenger, uncomfortably seated on a form after taking that</li>
<li class="L3176" rel="L3176">refection, had dropped into a doze, when a loud murmur and a rapid tide</li>
<li class="L3177" rel="L3177">of people setting up the stairs that led to the court, carried him along</li>
<li class="L3178" rel="L3178">with them.</li>
<li class="L3179" rel="L3179"></li>
<li class="L3180" rel="L3180">“Jerry! Jerry!” Mr. Lorry was already calling at the door when he got</li>
<li class="L3181" rel="L3181">there.</li>
<li class="L3182" rel="L3182"></li>
<li class="L3183" rel="L3183">“Here, sir! It&#39;s a fight to get back again. Here I am, sir!”</li>
<li class="L3184" rel="L3184"></li>
<li class="L3185" rel="L3185">Mr. Lorry handed him a paper through the throng. “Quick! Have you got</li>
<li class="L3186" rel="L3186">it?”</li>
<li class="L3187" rel="L3187"></li>
<li class="L3188" rel="L3188">“Yes, sir.”</li>
<li class="L3189" rel="L3189"></li>
<li class="L3190" rel="L3190">Hastily written on the paper was the word “ACQUITTED.”</li>
<li class="L3191" rel="L3191"></li>
<li class="L3192" rel="L3192">“If you had sent the message, &#39;Recalled to Life,&#39; again,” muttered</li>
<li class="L3193" rel="L3193">Jerry, as he turned, “I should have known what you meant, this time.”</li>
<li class="L3194" rel="L3194"></li>
<li class="L3195" rel="L3195">He had no opportunity of saying, or so much as thinking, anything else,</li>
<li class="L3196" rel="L3196">until he was clear of the Old Bailey; for, the crowd came pouring out</li>
<li class="L3197" rel="L3197">with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs, and a loud buzz</li>
<li class="L3198" rel="L3198">swept into the street as if the baffled blue-flies were dispersing in</li>
<li class="L3199" rel="L3199">search of other carrion.</li>
<li class="L3200" rel="L3200"></li>
<li class="L3201" rel="L3201"></li>
<li class="L3202" rel="L3202"></li>
<li class="L3203" rel="L3203"></li>
<li class="L3204" rel="L3204">IV. Congratulatory</li>
<li class="L3205" rel="L3205"></li>
<li class="L3206" rel="L3206"></li>
<li class="L3207" rel="L3207">From the dimly-lighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the</li>
<li class="L3208" rel="L3208">human stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off, when</li>
<li class="L3209" rel="L3209">Doctor Manette, Lucie Manette, his daughter, Mr. Lorry, the solicitor</li>
<li class="L3210" rel="L3210">for the defence, and its counsel, Mr. Stryver, stood gathered round Mr.</li>
<li class="L3211" rel="L3211">Charles Darnay--just released--congratulating him on his escape from</li>
<li class="L3212" rel="L3212">death.</li>
<li class="L3213" rel="L3213"></li>
<li class="L3214" rel="L3214">It would have been difficult by a far brighter light, to recognise</li>
<li class="L3215" rel="L3215">in Doctor Manette, intellectual of face and upright of bearing, the</li>
<li class="L3216" rel="L3216">shoemaker of the garret in Paris. Yet, no one could have looked at him</li>
<li class="L3217" rel="L3217">twice, without looking again: even though the opportunity of observation</li>
<li class="L3218" rel="L3218">had not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice, and</li>
<li class="L3219" rel="L3219">to the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully, without any apparent</li>
<li class="L3220" rel="L3220">reason. While one external cause, and that a reference to his long</li>
<li class="L3221" rel="L3221">lingering agony, would always--as on the trial--evoke this condition</li>
<li class="L3222" rel="L3222">from the depths of his soul, it was also in its nature to arise of</li>
<li class="L3223" rel="L3223">itself, and to draw a gloom over him, as incomprehensible to those</li>
<li class="L3224" rel="L3224">unacquainted with his story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual</li>
<li class="L3225" rel="L3225">Bastille thrown upon him by a summer sun, when the substance was three</li>
<li class="L3226" rel="L3226">hundred miles away.</li>
<li class="L3227" rel="L3227"></li>
<li class="L3228" rel="L3228">Only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from</li>
<li class="L3229" rel="L3229">his mind. She was the golden thread that united him to a Past beyond his</li>
<li class="L3230" rel="L3230">misery, and to a Present beyond his misery: and the sound of her voice,</li>
<li class="L3231" rel="L3231">the light of her face, the touch of her hand, had a strong beneficial</li>
<li class="L3232" rel="L3232">influence with him almost always. Not absolutely always, for she could</li>
<li class="L3233" rel="L3233">recall some occasions on which her power had failed; but they were few</li>
<li class="L3234" rel="L3234">and slight, and she believed them over.</li>
<li class="L3235" rel="L3235"></li>
<li class="L3236" rel="L3236">Mr. Darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully, and had turned</li>
<li class="L3237" rel="L3237">to Mr. Stryver, whom he warmly thanked. Mr. Stryver, a man of little</li>
<li class="L3238" rel="L3238">more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout,</li>
<li class="L3239" rel="L3239">loud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy, had a pushing</li>
<li class="L3240" rel="L3240">way of shouldering himself (morally and physically) into companies and</li>
<li class="L3241" rel="L3241">conversations, that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life.</li>
<li class="L3242" rel="L3242"></li>
<li class="L3243" rel="L3243">He still had his wig and gown on, and he said, squaring himself at his</li>
<li class="L3244" rel="L3244">late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent Mr. Lorry clean</li>
<li class="L3245" rel="L3245">out of the group: “I am glad to have brought you off with honour, Mr.</li>
<li class="L3246" rel="L3246">Darnay. It was an infamous prosecution, grossly infamous; but not the</li>
<li class="L3247" rel="L3247">less likely to succeed on that account.”</li>
<li class="L3248" rel="L3248"></li>
<li class="L3249" rel="L3249">“You have laid me under an obligation to you for life--in two senses,”</li>
<li class="L3250" rel="L3250"> said his late client, taking his hand.</li>
<li class="L3251" rel="L3251"></li>
<li class="L3252" rel="L3252">“I have done my best for you, Mr. Darnay; and my best is as good as</li>
<li class="L3253" rel="L3253">another man&#39;s, I believe.”</li>
<li class="L3254" rel="L3254"></li>
<li class="L3255" rel="L3255">It clearly being incumbent on some one to say, “Much better,” Mr. Lorry</li>
<li class="L3256" rel="L3256">said it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with the interested</li>
<li class="L3257" rel="L3257">object of squeezing himself back again.</li>
<li class="L3258" rel="L3258"></li>
<li class="L3259" rel="L3259">“You think so?” said Mr. Stryver. “Well! you have been present all day,</li>
<li class="L3260" rel="L3260">and you ought to know. You are a man of business, too.”</li>
<li class="L3261" rel="L3261"></li>
<li class="L3262" rel="L3262">“And as such,” quoth Mr. Lorry, whom the counsel learned in the law had</li>
<li class="L3263" rel="L3263">now shouldered back into the group, just as he had previously shouldered</li>
<li class="L3264" rel="L3264">him out of it--“as such I will appeal to Doctor Manette, to break up</li>
<li class="L3265" rel="L3265">this conference and order us all to our homes. Miss Lucie looks ill, Mr.</li>
<li class="L3266" rel="L3266">Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out.”</li>
<li class="L3267" rel="L3267"></li>
<li class="L3268" rel="L3268">“Speak for yourself, Mr. Lorry,” said Stryver; “I have a night&#39;s work to</li>
<li class="L3269" rel="L3269">do yet. Speak for yourself.”</li>
<li class="L3270" rel="L3270"></li>
<li class="L3271" rel="L3271">“I speak for myself,” answered Mr. Lorry, “and for Mr. Darnay, and for</li>
<li class="L3272" rel="L3272">Miss Lucie, and--Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us all?”</li>
<li class="L3273" rel="L3273"> He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her father.</li>
<li class="L3274" rel="L3274"></li>
<li class="L3275" rel="L3275">His face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at</li>
<li class="L3276" rel="L3276">Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust,</li>
<li class="L3277" rel="L3277">not even unmixed with fear. With this strange expression on him his</li>
<li class="L3278" rel="L3278">thoughts had wandered away.</li>
<li class="L3279" rel="L3279"></li>
<li class="L3280" rel="L3280">“My father,” said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his.</li>
<li class="L3281" rel="L3281"></li>
<li class="L3282" rel="L3282">He slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her.</li>
<li class="L3283" rel="L3283"></li>
<li class="L3284" rel="L3284">“Shall we go home, my father?”</li>
<li class="L3285" rel="L3285"></li>
<li class="L3286" rel="L3286">With a long breath, he answered “Yes.”</li>
<li class="L3287" rel="L3287"></li>
<li class="L3288" rel="L3288">The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the</li>
<li class="L3289" rel="L3289">impression--which he himself had originated--that he would not be</li>
<li class="L3290" rel="L3290">released that night. The lights were nearly all extinguished in the</li>
<li class="L3291" rel="L3291">passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle,</li>
<li class="L3292" rel="L3292">and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning&#39;s interest of</li>
<li class="L3293" rel="L3293">gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it.</li>
<li class="L3294" rel="L3294">Walking between her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into</li>
<li class="L3295" rel="L3295">the open air. A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter</li>
<li class="L3296" rel="L3296">departed in it.</li>
<li class="L3297" rel="L3297"></li>
<li class="L3298" rel="L3298">Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back</li>
<li class="L3299" rel="L3299">to the robing-room. Another person, who had not joined the group, or</li>
<li class="L3300" rel="L3300">interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning</li>
<li class="L3301" rel="L3301">against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled</li>
<li class="L3302" rel="L3302">out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away. He now</li>
<li class="L3303" rel="L3303">stepped up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay stood upon the pavement.</li>
<li class="L3304" rel="L3304"></li>
<li class="L3305" rel="L3305">“So, Mr. Lorry! Men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay now?”</li>
<li class="L3306" rel="L3306"></li>
<li class="L3307" rel="L3307">Nobody had made any acknowledgment of Mr. Carton&#39;s part in the day&#39;s</li>
<li class="L3308" rel="L3308">proceedings; nobody had known of it. He was unrobed, and was none the</li>
<li class="L3309" rel="L3309">better for it in appearance.</li>
<li class="L3310" rel="L3310"></li>
<li class="L3311" rel="L3311">“If you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind, when the</li>
<li class="L3312" rel="L3312">business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business</li>
<li class="L3313" rel="L3313">appearances, you would be amused, Mr. Darnay.”</li>
<li class="L3314" rel="L3314"></li>
<li class="L3315" rel="L3315">Mr. Lorry reddened, and said, warmly, “You have mentioned that before,</li>
<li class="L3316" rel="L3316">sir. We men of business, who serve a House, are not our own masters. We</li>
<li class="L3317" rel="L3317">have to think of the House more than ourselves.”</li>
<li class="L3318" rel="L3318"></li>
<li class="L3319" rel="L3319">“_I_ know, _I_ know,” rejoined Mr. Carton, carelessly. “Don&#39;t be</li>
<li class="L3320" rel="L3320">nettled, Mr. Lorry. You are as good as another, I have no doubt: better,</li>
<li class="L3321" rel="L3321">I dare say.”</li>
<li class="L3322" rel="L3322"></li>
<li class="L3323" rel="L3323">“And indeed, sir,” pursued Mr. Lorry, not minding him, “I really don&#39;t</li>
<li class="L3324" rel="L3324">know what you have to do with the matter. If you&#39;ll excuse me, as very</li>
<li class="L3325" rel="L3325">much your elder, for saying so, I really don&#39;t know that it is your</li>
<li class="L3326" rel="L3326">business.”</li>
<li class="L3327" rel="L3327"></li>
<li class="L3328" rel="L3328">“Business! Bless you, _I_ have no business,” said Mr. Carton.</li>
<li class="L3329" rel="L3329"></li>
<li class="L3330" rel="L3330">“It is a pity you have not, sir.”</li>
<li class="L3331" rel="L3331"></li>
<li class="L3332" rel="L3332">“I think so, too.”</li>
<li class="L3333" rel="L3333"></li>
<li class="L3334" rel="L3334">“If you had,” pursued Mr. Lorry, “perhaps you would attend to it.”</li>
<li class="L3335" rel="L3335"></li>
<li class="L3336" rel="L3336">“Lord love you, no!--I shouldn&#39;t,” said Mr. Carton.</li>
<li class="L3337" rel="L3337"></li>
<li class="L3338" rel="L3338">“Well, sir!” cried Mr. Lorry, thoroughly heated by his indifference,</li>
<li class="L3339" rel="L3339">“business is a very good thing, and a very respectable thing. And, sir,</li>
<li class="L3340" rel="L3340">if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments, Mr.</li>
<li class="L3341" rel="L3341">Darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance</li>
<li class="L3342" rel="L3342">for that circumstance. Mr. Darnay, good night, God bless you, sir!</li>
<li class="L3343" rel="L3343">I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy</li>
<li class="L3344" rel="L3344">life.--Chair there!”</li>
<li class="L3345" rel="L3345"></li>
<li class="L3346" rel="L3346">Perhaps a little angry with himself, as well as with the barrister, Mr.</li>
<li class="L3347" rel="L3347">Lorry bustled into the chair, and was carried off to Tellson&#39;s. Carton,</li>
<li class="L3348" rel="L3348">who smelt of port wine, and did not appear to be quite sober, laughed</li>
<li class="L3349" rel="L3349">then, and turned to Darnay:</li>
<li class="L3350" rel="L3350"></li>
<li class="L3351" rel="L3351">“This is a strange chance that throws you and me together. This must</li>
<li class="L3352" rel="L3352">be a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart on</li>
<li class="L3353" rel="L3353">these street stones?”</li>
<li class="L3354" rel="L3354"></li>
<li class="L3355" rel="L3355">“I hardly seem yet,” returned Charles Darnay, “to belong to this world</li>
<li class="L3356" rel="L3356">again.”</li>
<li class="L3357" rel="L3357"></li>
<li class="L3358" rel="L3358">“I don&#39;t wonder at it; it&#39;s not so long since you were pretty far</li>
<li class="L3359" rel="L3359">advanced on your way to another. You speak faintly.”</li>
<li class="L3360" rel="L3360"></li>
<li class="L3361" rel="L3361">“I begin to think I _am_ faint.”</li>
<li class="L3362" rel="L3362"></li>
<li class="L3363" rel="L3363">“Then why the devil don&#39;t you dine? I dined, myself, while those</li>
<li class="L3364" rel="L3364">numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to--this, or</li>
<li class="L3365" rel="L3365">some other. Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at.”</li>
<li class="L3366" rel="L3366"></li>
<li class="L3367" rel="L3367">Drawing his arm through his own, he took him down Ludgate-hill to</li>
<li class="L3368" rel="L3368">Fleet-street, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern. Here, they were</li>
<li class="L3369" rel="L3369">shown into a little room, where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting</li>
<li class="L3370" rel="L3370">his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while Carton sat</li>
<li class="L3371" rel="L3371">opposite to him at the same table, with his separate bottle of port</li>
<li class="L3372" rel="L3372">before him, and his fully half-insolent manner upon him.</li>
<li class="L3373" rel="L3373"></li>
<li class="L3374" rel="L3374">“Do you feel, yet, that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again, Mr.</li>
<li class="L3375" rel="L3375">Darnay?”</li>
<li class="L3376" rel="L3376"></li>
<li class="L3377" rel="L3377">“I am frightfully confused regarding time and place; but I am so far</li>
<li class="L3378" rel="L3378">mended as to feel that.”</li>
<li class="L3379" rel="L3379"></li>
<li class="L3380" rel="L3380">“It must be an immense satisfaction!”</li>
<li class="L3381" rel="L3381"></li>
<li class="L3382" rel="L3382">He said it bitterly, and filled up his glass again: which was a large</li>
<li class="L3383" rel="L3383">one.</li>
<li class="L3384" rel="L3384"></li>
<li class="L3385" rel="L3385">“As to me, the greatest desire I have, is to forget that I belong to it.</li>
<li class="L3386" rel="L3386">It has no good in it for me--except wine like this--nor I for it. So we</li>
<li class="L3387" rel="L3387">are not much alike in that particular. Indeed, I begin to think we are</li>
<li class="L3388" rel="L3388">not much alike in any particular, you and I.”</li>
<li class="L3389" rel="L3389"></li>
<li class="L3390" rel="L3390">Confused by the emotion of the day, and feeling his being there with</li>
<li class="L3391" rel="L3391">this Double of coarse deportment, to be like a dream, Charles Darnay was</li>
<li class="L3392" rel="L3392">at a loss how to answer; finally, answered not at all.</li>
<li class="L3393" rel="L3393"></li>
<li class="L3394" rel="L3394">“Now your dinner is done,” Carton presently said, “why don&#39;t you call a</li>
<li class="L3395" rel="L3395">health, Mr. Darnay; why don&#39;t you give your toast?”</li>
<li class="L3396" rel="L3396"></li>
<li class="L3397" rel="L3397">“What health? What toast?”</li>
<li class="L3398" rel="L3398"></li>
<li class="L3399" rel="L3399">“Why, it&#39;s on the tip of your tongue. It ought to be, it must be, I&#39;ll</li>
<li class="L3400" rel="L3400">swear it&#39;s there.”</li>
<li class="L3401" rel="L3401"></li>
<li class="L3402" rel="L3402">“Miss Manette, then!”</li>
<li class="L3403" rel="L3403"></li>
<li class="L3404" rel="L3404">“Miss Manette, then!”</li>
<li class="L3405" rel="L3405"></li>
<li class="L3406" rel="L3406">Looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast, Carton</li>
<li class="L3407" rel="L3407">flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall, where it shivered to</li>
<li class="L3408" rel="L3408">pieces; then, rang the bell, and ordered in another.</li>
<li class="L3409" rel="L3409"></li>
<li class="L3410" rel="L3410">“That&#39;s a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark, Mr. Darnay!”</li>
<li class="L3411" rel="L3411"> he said, filling his new goblet.</li>
<li class="L3412" rel="L3412"></li>
<li class="L3413" rel="L3413">A slight frown and a laconic “Yes,” were the answer.</li>
<li class="L3414" rel="L3414"></li>
<li class="L3415" rel="L3415">“That&#39;s a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by! How does it</li>
<li class="L3416" rel="L3416">feel? Is it worth being tried for one&#39;s life, to be the object of such</li>
<li class="L3417" rel="L3417">sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?”</li>
<li class="L3418" rel="L3418"></li>
<li class="L3419" rel="L3419">Again Darnay answered not a word.</li>
<li class="L3420" rel="L3420"></li>
<li class="L3421" rel="L3421">“She was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her. Not</li>
<li class="L3422" rel="L3422">that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was.”</li>
<li class="L3423" rel="L3423"></li>
<li class="L3424" rel="L3424">The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this</li>
<li class="L3425" rel="L3425">disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the</li>
<li class="L3426" rel="L3426">strait of the day. He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him</li>
<li class="L3427" rel="L3427">for it.</li>
<li class="L3428" rel="L3428"></li>
<li class="L3429" rel="L3429">“I neither want any thanks, nor merit any,” was the careless rejoinder.</li>
<li class="L3430" rel="L3430">“It was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don&#39;t know why I did</li>
<li class="L3431" rel="L3431">it, in the second. Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question.”</li>
<li class="L3432" rel="L3432"></li>
<li class="L3433" rel="L3433">“Willingly, and a small return for your good offices.”</li>
<li class="L3434" rel="L3434"></li>
<li class="L3435" rel="L3435">“Do you think I particularly like you?”</li>
<li class="L3436" rel="L3436"></li>
<li class="L3437" rel="L3437">“Really, Mr. Carton,” returned the other, oddly disconcerted, “I have</li>
<li class="L3438" rel="L3438">not asked myself the question.”</li>
<li class="L3439" rel="L3439"></li>
<li class="L3440" rel="L3440">“But ask yourself the question now.”</li>
<li class="L3441" rel="L3441"></li>
<li class="L3442" rel="L3442">“You have acted as if you do; but I don&#39;t think you do.”</li>
<li class="L3443" rel="L3443"></li>
<li class="L3444" rel="L3444">“_I_ don&#39;t think I do,” said Carton. “I begin to have a very good</li>
<li class="L3445" rel="L3445">opinion of your understanding.”</li>
<li class="L3446" rel="L3446"></li>
<li class="L3447" rel="L3447">“Nevertheless,” pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, “there is</li>
<li class="L3448" rel="L3448">nothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our</li>
<li class="L3449" rel="L3449">parting without ill-blood on either side.”</li>
<li class="L3450" rel="L3450"></li>
<li class="L3451" rel="L3451">Carton rejoining, “Nothing in life!” Darnay rang. “Do you call the whole</li>
<li class="L3452" rel="L3452">reckoning?” said Carton. On his answering in the affirmative, “Then</li>
<li class="L3453" rel="L3453">bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and wake me at</li>
<li class="L3454" rel="L3454">ten.”</li>
<li class="L3455" rel="L3455"></li>
<li class="L3456" rel="L3456">The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night.</li>
<li class="L3457" rel="L3457">Without returning the wish, Carton rose too, with something of a threat</li>
<li class="L3458" rel="L3458">of defiance in his manner, and said, “A last word, Mr. Darnay: you think</li>
<li class="L3459" rel="L3459">I am drunk?”</li>
<li class="L3460" rel="L3460"></li>
<li class="L3461" rel="L3461">“I think you have been drinking, Mr. Carton.”</li>
<li class="L3462" rel="L3462"></li>
<li class="L3463" rel="L3463">“Think? You know I have been drinking.”</li>
<li class="L3464" rel="L3464"></li>
<li class="L3465" rel="L3465">“Since I must say so, I know it.”</li>
<li class="L3466" rel="L3466"></li>
<li class="L3467" rel="L3467">“Then you shall likewise know why. I am a disappointed drudge, sir. I</li>
<li class="L3468" rel="L3468">care for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for me.”</li>
<li class="L3469" rel="L3469"></li>
<li class="L3470" rel="L3470">“Much to be regretted. You might have used your talents better.”</li>
<li class="L3471" rel="L3471"></li>
<li class="L3472" rel="L3472">“May be so, Mr. Darnay; may be not. Don&#39;t let your sober face elate you,</li>
<li class="L3473" rel="L3473">however; you don&#39;t know what it may come to. Good night!”</li>
<li class="L3474" rel="L3474"></li>
<li class="L3475" rel="L3475">When he was left alone, this strange being took up a candle, went to a</li>
<li class="L3476" rel="L3476">glass that hung against the wall, and surveyed himself minutely in it.</li>
<li class="L3477" rel="L3477"></li>
<li class="L3478" rel="L3478">“Do you particularly like the man?” he muttered, at his own image; “why</li>
<li class="L3479" rel="L3479">should you particularly like a man who resembles you? There is nothing</li>
<li class="L3480" rel="L3480">in you to like; you know that. Ah, confound you! What a change you have</li>
<li class="L3481" rel="L3481">made in yourself! A good reason for taking to a man, that he shows you</li>
<li class="L3482" rel="L3482">what you have fallen away from, and what you might have been! Change</li>
<li class="L3483" rel="L3483">places with him, and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as</li>
<li class="L3484" rel="L3484">he was, and commiserated by that agitated face as he was? Come on, and</li>
<li class="L3485" rel="L3485">have it out in plain words! You hate the fellow.”</li>
<li class="L3486" rel="L3486"></li>
<li class="L3487" rel="L3487">He resorted to his pint of wine for consolation, drank it all in a few</li>
<li class="L3488" rel="L3488">minutes, and fell asleep on his arms, with his hair straggling over the</li>
<li class="L3489" rel="L3489">table, and a long winding-sheet in the candle dripping down upon him.</li>
<li class="L3490" rel="L3490"></li>
<li class="L3491" rel="L3491"></li>
<li class="L3492" rel="L3492"></li>
<li class="L3493" rel="L3493"></li>
<li class="L3494" rel="L3494">V. The Jackal</li>
<li class="L3495" rel="L3495"></li>
<li class="L3496" rel="L3496"></li>
<li class="L3497" rel="L3497">Those were drinking days, and most men drank hard. So very great is</li>
<li class="L3498" rel="L3498">the improvement Time has brought about in such habits, that a moderate</li>
<li class="L3499" rel="L3499">statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow</li>
<li class="L3500" rel="L3500">in the course of a night, without any detriment to his reputation as a</li>
<li class="L3501" rel="L3501">perfect gentleman, would seem, in these days, a ridiculous exaggeration.</li>
<li class="L3502" rel="L3502">The learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other</li>
<li class="L3503" rel="L3503">learned profession in its Bacchanalian propensities; neither was Mr.</li>
<li class="L3504" rel="L3504">Stryver, already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative</li>
<li class="L3505" rel="L3505">practice, behind his compeers in this particular, any more than in the</li>
<li class="L3506" rel="L3506">drier parts of the legal race.</li>
<li class="L3507" rel="L3507"></li>
<li class="L3508" rel="L3508">A favourite at the Old Bailey, and eke at the Sessions, Mr. Stryver had</li>
<li class="L3509" rel="L3509">begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which</li>
<li class="L3510" rel="L3510">he mounted. Sessions and Old Bailey had now to summon their favourite,</li>
<li class="L3511" rel="L3511">specially, to their longing arms; and shouldering itself towards the</li>
<li class="L3512" rel="L3512">visage of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of King&#39;s Bench, the</li>
<li class="L3513" rel="L3513">florid countenance of Mr. Stryver might be daily seen, bursting out of</li>
<li class="L3514" rel="L3514">the bed of wigs, like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from</li>
<li class="L3515" rel="L3515">among a rank garden-full of flaring companions.</li>
<li class="L3516" rel="L3516"></li>
<li class="L3517" rel="L3517">It had once been noted at the Bar, that while Mr. Stryver was a glib</li>
<li class="L3518" rel="L3518">man, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a bold, he had not that</li>
<li class="L3519" rel="L3519">faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements, which is</li>
<li class="L3520" rel="L3520">among the most striking and necessary of the advocate&#39;s accomplishments.</li>
<li class="L3521" rel="L3521">But, a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this. The more</li>
<li class="L3522" rel="L3522">business he got, the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its</li>
<li class="L3523" rel="L3523">pith and marrow; and however late at night he sat carousing with Sydney</li>
<li class="L3524" rel="L3524">Carton, he always had his points at his fingers&#39; ends in the morning.</li>
<li class="L3525" rel="L3525"></li>
<li class="L3526" rel="L3526">Sydney Carton, idlest and most unpromising of men, was Stryver&#39;s great</li>
<li class="L3527" rel="L3527">ally. What the two drank together, between Hilary Term and Michaelmas,</li>
<li class="L3528" rel="L3528">might have floated a king&#39;s ship. Stryver never had a case in hand,</li>
<li class="L3529" rel="L3529">anywhere, but Carton was there, with his hands in his pockets, staring</li>
<li class="L3530" rel="L3530">at the ceiling of the court; they went the same Circuit, and even there</li>
<li class="L3531" rel="L3531">they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and Carton was</li>
<li class="L3532" rel="L3532">rumoured to be seen at broad day, going home stealthily and unsteadily</li>
<li class="L3533" rel="L3533">to his lodgings, like a dissipated cat. At last, it began to get about,</li>
<li class="L3534" rel="L3534">among such as were interested in the matter, that although Sydney Carton</li>
<li class="L3535" rel="L3535">would never be a lion, he was an amazingly good jackal, and that he</li>
<li class="L3536" rel="L3536">rendered suit and service to Stryver in that humble capacity.</li>
<li class="L3537" rel="L3537"></li>
<li class="L3538" rel="L3538">“Ten o&#39;clock, sir,” said the man at the tavern, whom he had charged to</li>
<li class="L3539" rel="L3539">wake him--“ten o&#39;clock, sir.”</li>
<li class="L3540" rel="L3540"></li>
<li class="L3541" rel="L3541">“_What&#39;s_ the matter?”</li>
<li class="L3542" rel="L3542"></li>
<li class="L3543" rel="L3543">“Ten o&#39;clock, sir.”</li>
<li class="L3544" rel="L3544"></li>
<li class="L3545" rel="L3545">“What do you mean? Ten o&#39;clock at night?”</li>
<li class="L3546" rel="L3546"></li>
<li class="L3547" rel="L3547">“Yes, sir. Your honour told me to call you.”</li>
<li class="L3548" rel="L3548"></li>
<li class="L3549" rel="L3549">“Oh! I remember. Very well, very well.”</li>
<li class="L3550" rel="L3550"></li>
<li class="L3551" rel="L3551">After a few dull efforts to get to sleep again, which the man</li>
<li class="L3552" rel="L3552">dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes,</li>
<li class="L3553" rel="L3553">he got up, tossed his hat on, and walked out. He turned into the Temple,</li>
<li class="L3554" rel="L3554">and, having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of King&#39;s</li>
<li class="L3555" rel="L3555">Bench-walk and Paper-buildings, turned into the Stryver chambers.</li>
<li class="L3556" rel="L3556"></li>
<li class="L3557" rel="L3557">The Stryver clerk, who never assisted at these conferences, had gone</li>
<li class="L3558" rel="L3558">home, and the Stryver principal opened the door. He had his slippers on,</li>
<li class="L3559" rel="L3559">and a loose bed-gown, and his throat was bare for his greater ease. He</li>
<li class="L3560" rel="L3560">had that rather wild, strained, seared marking about the eyes, which</li>
<li class="L3561" rel="L3561">may be observed in all free livers of his class, from the portrait of</li>
<li class="L3562" rel="L3562">Jeffries downward, and which can be traced, under various disguises of</li>
<li class="L3563" rel="L3563">Art, through the portraits of every Drinking Age.</li>
<li class="L3564" rel="L3564"></li>
<li class="L3565" rel="L3565">“You are a little late, Memory,” said Stryver.</li>
<li class="L3566" rel="L3566"></li>
<li class="L3567" rel="L3567">“About the usual time; it may be a quarter of an hour later.”</li>
<li class="L3568" rel="L3568"></li>
<li class="L3569" rel="L3569">They went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers,</li>
<li class="L3570" rel="L3570">where there was a blazing fire. A kettle steamed upon the hob, and in</li>
<li class="L3571" rel="L3571">the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone, with plenty of wine upon</li>
<li class="L3572" rel="L3572">it, and brandy, and rum, and sugar, and lemons.</li>
<li class="L3573" rel="L3573"></li>
<li class="L3574" rel="L3574">“You have had your bottle, I perceive, Sydney.”</li>
<li class="L3575" rel="L3575"></li>
<li class="L3576" rel="L3576">“Two to-night, I think. I have been dining with the day&#39;s client; or</li>
<li class="L3577" rel="L3577">seeing him dine--it&#39;s all one!”</li>
<li class="L3578" rel="L3578"></li>
<li class="L3579" rel="L3579">“That was a rare point, Sydney, that you brought to bear upon the</li>
<li class="L3580" rel="L3580">identification. How did you come by it? When did it strike you?”</li>
<li class="L3581" rel="L3581"></li>
<li class="L3582" rel="L3582">“I thought he was rather a handsome fellow, and I thought I should have</li>
<li class="L3583" rel="L3583">been much the same sort of fellow, if I had had any luck.”</li>
<li class="L3584" rel="L3584"></li>
<li class="L3585" rel="L3585">Mr. Stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch.</li>
<li class="L3586" rel="L3586"></li>
<li class="L3587" rel="L3587">“You and your luck, Sydney! Get to work, get to work.”</li>
<li class="L3588" rel="L3588"></li>
<li class="L3589" rel="L3589">Sullenly enough, the jackal loosened his dress, went into an adjoining</li>
<li class="L3590" rel="L3590">room, and came back with a large jug of cold water, a basin, and a towel</li>
<li class="L3591" rel="L3591">or two. Steeping the towels in the water, and partially wringing them</li>
<li class="L3592" rel="L3592">out, he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold, sat down</li>
<li class="L3593" rel="L3593">at the table, and said, “Now I am ready!”</li>
<li class="L3594" rel="L3594"></li>
<li class="L3595" rel="L3595">“Not much boiling down to be done to-night, Memory,” said Mr. Stryver,</li>
<li class="L3596" rel="L3596">gaily, as he looked among his papers.</li>
<li class="L3597" rel="L3597"></li>
<li class="L3598" rel="L3598">“How much?”</li>
<li class="L3599" rel="L3599"></li>
<li class="L3600" rel="L3600">“Only two sets of them.”</li>
<li class="L3601" rel="L3601"></li>
<li class="L3602" rel="L3602">“Give me the worst first.”</li>
<li class="L3603" rel="L3603"></li>
<li class="L3604" rel="L3604">“There they are, Sydney. Fire away!”</li>
<li class="L3605" rel="L3605"></li>
<li class="L3606" rel="L3606">The lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of the</li>
<li class="L3607" rel="L3607">drinking-table, while the jackal sat at his own paper-bestrewn table</li>
<li class="L3608" rel="L3608">proper, on the other side of it, with the bottles and glasses ready to</li>
<li class="L3609" rel="L3609">his hand. Both resorted to the drinking-table without stint, but each in</li>
<li class="L3610" rel="L3610">a different way; the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in</li>
<li class="L3611" rel="L3611">his waistband, looking at the fire, or occasionally flirting with some</li>
<li class="L3612" rel="L3612">lighter document; the jackal, with knitted brows and intent face,</li>
<li class="L3613" rel="L3613">so deep in his task, that his eyes did not even follow the hand he</li>
<li class="L3614" rel="L3614">stretched out for his glass--which often groped about, for a minute or</li>
<li class="L3615" rel="L3615">more, before it found the glass for his lips. Two or three times, the</li>
<li class="L3616" rel="L3616">matter in hand became so knotty, that the jackal found it imperative on</li>
<li class="L3617" rel="L3617">him to get up, and steep his towels anew. From these pilgrimages to the</li>
<li class="L3618" rel="L3618">jug and basin, he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as</li>
<li class="L3619" rel="L3619">no words can describe; which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious</li>
<li class="L3620" rel="L3620">gravity.</li>
<li class="L3621" rel="L3621"></li>
<li class="L3622" rel="L3622">At length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion, and</li>
<li class="L3623" rel="L3623">proceeded to offer it to him. The lion took it with care and caution,</li>
<li class="L3624" rel="L3624">made his selections from it, and his remarks upon it, and the jackal</li>
<li class="L3625" rel="L3625">assisted both. When the repast was fully discussed, the lion put his</li>
<li class="L3626" rel="L3626">hands in his waistband again, and lay down to meditate. The jackal then</li>
<li class="L3627" rel="L3627">invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle, and a fresh application</li>
<li class="L3628" rel="L3628">to his head, and applied himself to the collection of a second meal;</li>
<li class="L3629" rel="L3629">this was administered to the lion in the same manner, and was not</li>
<li class="L3630" rel="L3630">disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning.</li>
<li class="L3631" rel="L3631"></li>
<li class="L3632" rel="L3632">“And now we have done, Sydney, fill a bumper of punch,” said Mr.</li>
<li class="L3633" rel="L3633">Stryver.</li>
<li class="L3634" rel="L3634"></li>
<li class="L3635" rel="L3635">The jackal removed the towels from his head, which had been steaming</li>
<li class="L3636" rel="L3636">again, shook himself, yawned, shivered, and complied.</li>
<li class="L3637" rel="L3637"></li>
<li class="L3638" rel="L3638">“You were very sound, Sydney, in the matter of those crown witnesses</li>
<li class="L3639" rel="L3639">to-day. Every question told.”</li>
<li class="L3640" rel="L3640"></li>
<li class="L3641" rel="L3641">“I always am sound; am I not?”</li>
<li class="L3642" rel="L3642"></li>
<li class="L3643" rel="L3643">“I don&#39;t gainsay it. What has roughened your temper? Put some punch to</li>
<li class="L3644" rel="L3644">it and smooth it again.”</li>
<li class="L3645" rel="L3645"></li>
<li class="L3646" rel="L3646">With a deprecatory grunt, the jackal again complied.</li>
<li class="L3647" rel="L3647"></li>
<li class="L3648" rel="L3648">“The old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School,” said Stryver, nodding</li>
<li class="L3649" rel="L3649">his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past, “the</li>
<li class="L3650" rel="L3650">old seesaw Sydney. Up one minute and down the next; now in spirits and</li>
<li class="L3651" rel="L3651">now in despondency!”</li>
<li class="L3652" rel="L3652"></li>
<li class="L3653" rel="L3653">“Ah!” returned the other, sighing: “yes! The same Sydney, with the same</li>
<li class="L3654" rel="L3654">luck. Even then, I did exercises for other boys, and seldom did my own.”</li>
<li class="L3655" rel="L3655"></li>
<li class="L3656" rel="L3656">“And why not?”</li>
<li class="L3657" rel="L3657"></li>
<li class="L3658" rel="L3658">“God knows. It was my way, I suppose.”</li>
<li class="L3659" rel="L3659"></li>
<li class="L3660" rel="L3660">He sat, with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before</li>
<li class="L3661" rel="L3661">him, looking at the fire.</li>
<li class="L3662" rel="L3662"></li>
<li class="L3663" rel="L3663">“Carton,” said his friend, squaring himself at him with a bullying air,</li>
<li class="L3664" rel="L3664">as if the fire-grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour</li>
<li class="L3665" rel="L3665">was forged, and the one delicate thing to be done for the old Sydney</li>
<li class="L3666" rel="L3666">Carton of old Shrewsbury School was to shoulder him into it, “your way</li>
<li class="L3667" rel="L3667">is, and always was, a lame way. You summon no energy and purpose. Look</li>
<li class="L3668" rel="L3668">at me.”</li>
<li class="L3669" rel="L3669"></li>
<li class="L3670" rel="L3670">“Oh, botheration!” returned Sydney, with a lighter and more</li>
<li class="L3671" rel="L3671">good-humoured laugh, “don&#39;t _you_ be moral!”</li>
<li class="L3672" rel="L3672"></li>
<li class="L3673" rel="L3673">“How have I done what I have done?” said Stryver; “how do I do what I</li>
<li class="L3674" rel="L3674">do?”</li>
<li class="L3675" rel="L3675"></li>
<li class="L3676" rel="L3676">“Partly through paying me to help you, I suppose. But it&#39;s not worth</li>
<li class="L3677" rel="L3677">your while to apostrophise me, or the air, about it; what you want to</li>
<li class="L3678" rel="L3678">do, you do. You were always in the front rank, and I was always behind.”</li>
<li class="L3679" rel="L3679"></li>
<li class="L3680" rel="L3680">“I had to get into the front rank; I was not born there, was I?”</li>
<li class="L3681" rel="L3681"></li>
<li class="L3682" rel="L3682">“I was not present at the ceremony; but my opinion is you were,” said</li>
<li class="L3683" rel="L3683">Carton. At this, he laughed again, and they both laughed.</li>
<li class="L3684" rel="L3684"></li>
<li class="L3685" rel="L3685">“Before Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, and ever since Shrewsbury,”</li>
<li class="L3686" rel="L3686"> pursued Carton, “you have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into</li>
<li class="L3687" rel="L3687">mine. Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of Paris,</li>
<li class="L3688" rel="L3688">picking up French, and French law, and other French crumbs that we</li>
<li class="L3689" rel="L3689">didn&#39;t get much good of, you were always somewhere, and I was always</li>
<li class="L3690" rel="L3690">nowhere.”</li>
<li class="L3691" rel="L3691"></li>
<li class="L3692" rel="L3692">“And whose fault was that?”</li>
<li class="L3693" rel="L3693"></li>
<li class="L3694" rel="L3694">“Upon my soul, I am not sure that it was not yours. You were always</li>
<li class="L3695" rel="L3695">driving and riving and shouldering and passing, to that restless degree</li>
<li class="L3696" rel="L3696">that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose. It&#39;s a gloomy</li>
<li class="L3697" rel="L3697">thing, however, to talk about one&#39;s own past, with the day breaking.</li>
<li class="L3698" rel="L3698">Turn me in some other direction before I go.”</li>
<li class="L3699" rel="L3699"></li>
<li class="L3700" rel="L3700">“Well then! Pledge me to the pretty witness,” said Stryver, holding up</li>
<li class="L3701" rel="L3701">his glass. “Are you turned in a pleasant direction?”</li>
<li class="L3702" rel="L3702"></li>
<li class="L3703" rel="L3703">Apparently not, for he became gloomy again.</li>
<li class="L3704" rel="L3704"></li>
<li class="L3705" rel="L3705">“Pretty witness,” he muttered, looking down into his glass. “I have had</li>
<li class="L3706" rel="L3706">enough of witnesses to-day and to-night; who&#39;s your pretty witness?”</li>
<li class="L3707" rel="L3707"></li>
<li class="L3708" rel="L3708">“The picturesque doctor&#39;s daughter, Miss Manette.”</li>
<li class="L3709" rel="L3709"></li>
<li class="L3710" rel="L3710">“_She_ pretty?”</li>
<li class="L3711" rel="L3711"></li>
<li class="L3712" rel="L3712">“Is she not?”</li>
<li class="L3713" rel="L3713"></li>
<li class="L3714" rel="L3714">“No.”</li>
<li class="L3715" rel="L3715"></li>
<li class="L3716" rel="L3716">“Why, man alive, she was the admiration of the whole Court!”</li>
<li class="L3717" rel="L3717"></li>
<li class="L3718" rel="L3718">“Rot the admiration of the whole Court! Who made the Old Bailey a judge</li>
<li class="L3719" rel="L3719">of beauty? She was a golden-haired doll!”</li>
<li class="L3720" rel="L3720"></li>
<li class="L3721" rel="L3721">“Do you know, Sydney,” said Mr. Stryver, looking at him with sharp eyes,</li>
<li class="L3722" rel="L3722">and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face: “do you know, I rather</li>
<li class="L3723" rel="L3723">thought, at the time, that you sympathised with the golden-haired doll,</li>
<li class="L3724" rel="L3724">and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll?”</li>
<li class="L3725" rel="L3725"></li>
<li class="L3726" rel="L3726">“Quick to see what happened! If a girl, doll or no doll, swoons within a</li>
<li class="L3727" rel="L3727">yard or two of a man&#39;s nose, he can see it without a perspective-glass.</li>
<li class="L3728" rel="L3728">I pledge you, but I deny the beauty. And now I&#39;ll have no more drink;</li>
<li class="L3729" rel="L3729">I&#39;ll get to bed.”</li>
<li class="L3730" rel="L3730"></li>
<li class="L3731" rel="L3731">When his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle, to light</li>
<li class="L3732" rel="L3732">him down the stairs, the day was coldly looking in through its grimy</li>
<li class="L3733" rel="L3733">windows. When he got out of the house, the air was cold and sad, the</li>
<li class="L3734" rel="L3734">dull sky overcast, the river dark and dim, the whole scene like a</li>
<li class="L3735" rel="L3735">lifeless desert. And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round</li>
<li class="L3736" rel="L3736">before the morning blast, as if the desert-sand had risen far away, and</li>
<li class="L3737" rel="L3737">the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city.</li>
<li class="L3738" rel="L3738"></li>
<li class="L3739" rel="L3739">Waste forces within him, and a desert all around, this man stood still</li>
<li class="L3740" rel="L3740">on his way across a silent terrace, and saw for a moment, lying in the</li>
<li class="L3741" rel="L3741">wilderness before him, a mirage of honourable ambition, self-denial, and</li>
<li class="L3742" rel="L3742">perseverance. In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries</li>
<li class="L3743" rel="L3743">from which the loves and graces looked upon him, gardens in which the</li>
<li class="L3744" rel="L3744">fruits of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his sight.</li>
<li class="L3745" rel="L3745">A moment, and it was gone. Climbing to a high chamber in a well of</li>
<li class="L3746" rel="L3746">houses, he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed, and its</li>
<li class="L3747" rel="L3747">pillow was wet with wasted tears.</li>
<li class="L3748" rel="L3748"></li>
<li class="L3749" rel="L3749">Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of</li>
<li class="L3750" rel="L3750">good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise,</li>
<li class="L3751" rel="L3751">incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight</li>
<li class="L3752" rel="L3752">on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.</li>
<li class="L3753" rel="L3753"></li>
<li class="L3754" rel="L3754"></li>
<li class="L3755" rel="L3755"></li>
<li class="L3756" rel="L3756"></li>
<li class="L3757" rel="L3757">VI. Hundreds of People</li>
<li class="L3758" rel="L3758"></li>
<li class="L3759" rel="L3759"></li>
<li class="L3760" rel="L3760">The quiet lodgings of Doctor Manette were in a quiet street-corner not</li>
<li class="L3761" rel="L3761">far from Soho-square. On the afternoon of a certain fine Sunday when the</li>
<li class="L3762" rel="L3762">waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason, and carried</li>
<li class="L3763" rel="L3763">it, as to the public interest and memory, far out to sea, Mr. Jarvis</li>
<li class="L3764" rel="L3764">Lorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he lived,</li>
<li class="L3765" rel="L3765">on his way to dine with the Doctor. After several relapses into</li>
<li class="L3766" rel="L3766">business-absorption, Mr. Lorry had become the Doctor&#39;s friend, and the</li>
<li class="L3767" rel="L3767">quiet street-corner was the sunny part of his life.</li>
<li class="L3768" rel="L3768"></li>
<li class="L3769" rel="L3769">On this certain fine Sunday, Mr. Lorry walked towards Soho, early in</li>
<li class="L3770" rel="L3770">the afternoon, for three reasons of habit. Firstly, because, on fine</li>
<li class="L3771" rel="L3771">Sundays, he often walked out, before dinner, with the Doctor and Lucie;</li>
<li class="L3772" rel="L3772">secondly, because, on unfavourable Sundays, he was accustomed to be with</li>
<li class="L3773" rel="L3773">them as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of window, and</li>
<li class="L3774" rel="L3774">generally getting through the day; thirdly, because he happened to have</li>
<li class="L3775" rel="L3775">his own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how the ways of the</li>
<li class="L3776" rel="L3776">Doctor&#39;s household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving</li>
<li class="L3777" rel="L3777">them.</li>
<li class="L3778" rel="L3778"></li>
<li class="L3779" rel="L3779">A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived, was not to be</li>
<li class="L3780" rel="L3780">found in London. There was no way through it, and the front windows of</li>
<li class="L3781" rel="L3781">the Doctor&#39;s lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that</li>
<li class="L3782" rel="L3782">had a congenial air of retirement on it. There were few buildings then,</li>
<li class="L3783" rel="L3783">north of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and wild flowers</li>
<li class="L3784" rel="L3784">grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields. As a</li>
<li class="L3785" rel="L3785">consequence, country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous freedom,</li>
<li class="L3786" rel="L3786">instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a</li>
<li class="L3787" rel="L3787">settlement; and there was many a good south wall, not far off, on which</li>
<li class="L3788" rel="L3788">the peaches ripened in their season.</li>
<li class="L3789" rel="L3789"></li>
<li class="L3790" rel="L3790">The summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part</li>
<li class="L3791" rel="L3791">of the day; but, when the streets grew hot, the corner was in shadow,</li>
<li class="L3792" rel="L3792">though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a</li>
<li class="L3793" rel="L3793">glare of brightness. It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful</li>
<li class="L3794" rel="L3794">place for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging streets.</li>
<li class="L3795" rel="L3795"></li>
<li class="L3796" rel="L3796">There ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage, and</li>
<li class="L3797" rel="L3797">there was. The Doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house, where</li>
<li class="L3798" rel="L3798">several callings purported to be pursued by day, but whereof little was</li>
<li class="L3799" rel="L3799">audible any day, and which was shunned by all of them at night. In</li>
<li class="L3800" rel="L3800">a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane-tree</li>
<li class="L3801" rel="L3801">rustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made, and silver</li>
<li class="L3802" rel="L3802">to be chased, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant</li>
<li class="L3803" rel="L3803">who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall--as if</li>
<li class="L3804" rel="L3804">he had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of all</li>
<li class="L3805" rel="L3805">visitors. Very little of these trades, or of a lonely lodger rumoured</li>
<li class="L3806" rel="L3806">to live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have</li>
<li class="L3807" rel="L3807">a counting-house below, was ever heard or seen. Occasionally, a stray</li>
<li class="L3808" rel="L3808">workman putting his coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered</li>
<li class="L3809" rel="L3809">about there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a</li>
<li class="L3810" rel="L3810">thump from the golden giant. These, however, were only the exceptions</li>
<li class="L3811" rel="L3811">required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind</li>
<li class="L3812" rel="L3812">the house, and the echoes in the corner before it, had their own way</li>
<li class="L3813" rel="L3813">from Sunday morning unto Saturday night.</li>
<li class="L3814" rel="L3814"></li>
<li class="L3815" rel="L3815">Doctor Manette received such patients here as his old reputation, and</li>
<li class="L3816" rel="L3816">its revival in the floating whispers of his story, brought him.</li>
<li class="L3817" rel="L3817">His scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting</li>
<li class="L3818" rel="L3818">ingenious experiments, brought him otherwise into moderate request, and</li>
<li class="L3819" rel="L3819">he earned as much as he wanted.</li>
<li class="L3820" rel="L3820"></li>
<li class="L3821" rel="L3821">These things were within Mr. Jarvis Lorry&#39;s knowledge, thoughts, and</li>
<li class="L3822" rel="L3822">notice, when he rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the corner,</li>
<li class="L3823" rel="L3823">on the fine Sunday afternoon.</li>
<li class="L3824" rel="L3824"></li>
<li class="L3825" rel="L3825">“Doctor Manette at home?”</li>
<li class="L3826" rel="L3826"></li>
<li class="L3827" rel="L3827">Expected home.</li>
<li class="L3828" rel="L3828"></li>
<li class="L3829" rel="L3829">“Miss Lucie at home?”</li>
<li class="L3830" rel="L3830"></li>
<li class="L3831" rel="L3831">Expected home.</li>
<li class="L3832" rel="L3832"></li>
<li class="L3833" rel="L3833">“Miss Pross at home?”</li>
<li class="L3834" rel="L3834"></li>
<li class="L3835" rel="L3835">Possibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to</li>
<li class="L3836" rel="L3836">anticipate intentions of Miss Pross, as to admission or denial of the</li>
<li class="L3837" rel="L3837">fact.</li>
<li class="L3838" rel="L3838"></li>
<li class="L3839" rel="L3839">“As I am at home myself,” said Mr. Lorry, “I&#39;ll go upstairs.”</li>
<li class="L3840" rel="L3840"></li>
<li class="L3841" rel="L3841">Although the Doctor&#39;s daughter had known nothing of the country of her</li>
<li class="L3842" rel="L3842">birth, she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to</li>
<li class="L3843" rel="L3843">make much of little means, which is one of its most useful and most</li>
<li class="L3844" rel="L3844">agreeable characteristics. Simple as the furniture was, it was set off</li>
<li class="L3845" rel="L3845">by so many little adornments, of no value but for their taste and fancy,</li>
<li class="L3846" rel="L3846">that its effect was delightful. The disposition of everything in the</li>
<li class="L3847" rel="L3847">rooms, from the largest object to the least; the arrangement of colours,</li>
<li class="L3848" rel="L3848">the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles, by</li>
<li class="L3849" rel="L3849">delicate hands, clear eyes, and good sense; were at once so pleasant in</li>
<li class="L3850" rel="L3850">themselves, and so expressive of their originator, that, as Mr. Lorry</li>
<li class="L3851" rel="L3851">stood looking about him, the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him,</li>
<li class="L3852" rel="L3852">with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this</li>
<li class="L3853" rel="L3853">time, whether he approved?</li>
<li class="L3854" rel="L3854"></li>
<li class="L3855" rel="L3855">There were three rooms on a floor, and, the doors by which they</li>
<li class="L3856" rel="L3856">communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them</li>
<li class="L3857" rel="L3857">all, Mr. Lorry, smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which</li>
<li class="L3858" rel="L3858">he detected all around him, walked from one to another. The first was</li>
<li class="L3859" rel="L3859">the best room, and in it were Lucie&#39;s birds, and flowers, and books,</li>
<li class="L3860" rel="L3860">and desk, and work-table, and box of water-colours; the second was</li>
<li class="L3861" rel="L3861">the Doctor&#39;s consulting-room, used also as the dining-room; the third,</li>
<li class="L3862" rel="L3862">changingly speckled by the rustle of the plane-tree in the yard, was the</li>
<li class="L3863" rel="L3863">Doctor&#39;s bedroom, and there, in a corner, stood the disused shoemaker&#39;s</li>
<li class="L3864" rel="L3864">bench and tray of tools, much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the</li>
<li class="L3865" rel="L3865">dismal house by the wine-shop, in the suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris.</li>
<li class="L3866" rel="L3866"></li>
<li class="L3867" rel="L3867">“I wonder,” said Mr. Lorry, pausing in his looking about, “that he keeps</li>
<li class="L3868" rel="L3868">that reminder of his sufferings about him!”</li>
<li class="L3869" rel="L3869"></li>
<li class="L3870" rel="L3870">“And why wonder at that?” was the abrupt inquiry that made him start.</li>
<li class="L3871" rel="L3871"></li>
<li class="L3872" rel="L3872">It proceeded from Miss Pross, the wild red woman, strong of hand, whose</li>
<li class="L3873" rel="L3873">acquaintance he had first made at the Royal George Hotel at Dover, and</li>
<li class="L3874" rel="L3874">had since improved.</li>
<li class="L3875" rel="L3875"></li>
<li class="L3876" rel="L3876">“I should have thought--” Mr. Lorry began.</li>
<li class="L3877" rel="L3877"></li>
<li class="L3878" rel="L3878">“Pooh! You&#39;d have thought!” said Miss Pross; and Mr. Lorry left off.</li>
<li class="L3879" rel="L3879"></li>
<li class="L3880" rel="L3880">“How do you do?” inquired that lady then--sharply, and yet as if to</li>
<li class="L3881" rel="L3881">express that she bore him no malice.</li>
<li class="L3882" rel="L3882"></li>
<li class="L3883" rel="L3883">“I am pretty well, I thank you,” answered Mr. Lorry, with meekness; “how</li>
<li class="L3884" rel="L3884">are you?”</li>
<li class="L3885" rel="L3885"></li>
<li class="L3886" rel="L3886">“Nothing to boast of,” said Miss Pross.</li>
<li class="L3887" rel="L3887"></li>
<li class="L3888" rel="L3888">“Indeed?”</li>
<li class="L3889" rel="L3889"></li>
<li class="L3890" rel="L3890">“Ah! indeed!” said Miss Pross. “I am very much put out about my</li>
<li class="L3891" rel="L3891">Ladybird.”</li>
<li class="L3892" rel="L3892"></li>
<li class="L3893" rel="L3893">“Indeed?”</li>
<li class="L3894" rel="L3894"></li>
<li class="L3895" rel="L3895">“For gracious sake say something else besides &#39;indeed,&#39; or you&#39;ll</li>
<li class="L3896" rel="L3896">fidget me to death,” said Miss Pross: whose character (dissociated from</li>
<li class="L3897" rel="L3897">stature) was shortness.</li>
<li class="L3898" rel="L3898"></li>
<li class="L3899" rel="L3899">“Really, then?” said Mr. Lorry, as an amendment.</li>
<li class="L3900" rel="L3900"></li>
<li class="L3901" rel="L3901">“Really, is bad enough,” returned Miss Pross, “but better. Yes, I am</li>
<li class="L3902" rel="L3902">very much put out.”</li>
<li class="L3903" rel="L3903"></li>
<li class="L3904" rel="L3904">“May I ask the cause?”</li>
<li class="L3905" rel="L3905"></li>
<li class="L3906" rel="L3906">“I don&#39;t want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird, to</li>
<li class="L3907" rel="L3907">come here looking after her,” said Miss Pross.</li>
<li class="L3908" rel="L3908"></li>
<li class="L3909" rel="L3909">“_Do_ dozens come for that purpose?”</li>
<li class="L3910" rel="L3910"></li>
<li class="L3911" rel="L3911">“Hundreds,” said Miss Pross.</li>
<li class="L3912" rel="L3912"></li>
<li class="L3913" rel="L3913">It was characteristic of this lady (as of some other people before her</li>
<li class="L3914" rel="L3914">time and since) that whenever her original proposition was questioned,</li>
<li class="L3915" rel="L3915">she exaggerated it.</li>
<li class="L3916" rel="L3916"></li>
<li class="L3917" rel="L3917">“Dear me!” said Mr. Lorry, as the safest remark he could think of.</li>
<li class="L3918" rel="L3918"></li>
<li class="L3919" rel="L3919">“I have lived with the darling--or the darling has lived with me, and</li>
<li class="L3920" rel="L3920">paid me for it; which she certainly should never have done, you may take</li>
<li class="L3921" rel="L3921">your affidavit, if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her</li>
<li class="L3922" rel="L3922">for nothing--since she was ten years old. And it&#39;s really very hard,”</li>
<li class="L3923" rel="L3923"> said Miss Pross.</li>
<li class="L3924" rel="L3924"></li>
<li class="L3925" rel="L3925">Not seeing with precision what was very hard, Mr. Lorry shook his head;</li>
<li class="L3926" rel="L3926">using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would</li>
<li class="L3927" rel="L3927">fit anything.</li>
<li class="L3928" rel="L3928"></li>
<li class="L3929" rel="L3929">“All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet,</li>
<li class="L3930" rel="L3930">are always turning up,” said Miss Pross. “When you began it--”</li>
<li class="L3931" rel="L3931"></li>
<li class="L3932" rel="L3932">“_I_ began it, Miss Pross?”</li>
<li class="L3933" rel="L3933"></li>
<li class="L3934" rel="L3934">“Didn&#39;t you? Who brought her father to life?”</li>
<li class="L3935" rel="L3935"></li>
<li class="L3936" rel="L3936">“Oh! If _that_ was beginning it--” said Mr. Lorry.</li>
<li class="L3937" rel="L3937"></li>
<li class="L3938" rel="L3938">“It wasn&#39;t ending it, I suppose? I say, when you began it, it was hard</li>
<li class="L3939" rel="L3939">enough; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette, except</li>
<li class="L3940" rel="L3940">that he is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no imputation on</li>
<li class="L3941" rel="L3941">him, for it was not to be expected that anybody should be, under any</li>
<li class="L3942" rel="L3942">circumstances. But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds</li>
<li class="L3943" rel="L3943">and multitudes of people turning up after him (I could have forgiven</li>
<li class="L3944" rel="L3944">him), to take Ladybird&#39;s affections away from me.”</li>
<li class="L3945" rel="L3945"></li>
<li class="L3946" rel="L3946">Mr. Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very jealous, but he also knew her by</li>
<li class="L3947" rel="L3947">this time to be, beneath the service of her eccentricity, one of those</li>
<li class="L3948" rel="L3948">unselfish creatures--found only among women--who will, for pure love and</li>
<li class="L3949" rel="L3949">admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have lost</li>
<li class="L3950" rel="L3950">it, to beauty that they never had, to accomplishments that they were</li>
<li class="L3951" rel="L3951">never fortunate enough to gain, to bright hopes that never shone upon</li>
<li class="L3952" rel="L3952">their own sombre lives. He knew enough of the world to know that there</li>
<li class="L3953" rel="L3953">is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart; so</li>
<li class="L3954" rel="L3954">rendered and so free from any mercenary taint, he had such an exalted</li>
<li class="L3955" rel="L3955">respect for it, that in the retributive arrangements made by his own</li>
<li class="L3956" rel="L3956">mind--we all make such arrangements, more or less--he stationed Miss</li>
<li class="L3957" rel="L3957">Pross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably</li>
<li class="L3958" rel="L3958">better got up both by Nature and Art, who had balances at Tellson&#39;s.</li>
<li class="L3959" rel="L3959"></li>
<li class="L3960" rel="L3960">“There never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of Ladybird,” said</li>
<li class="L3961" rel="L3961">Miss Pross; “and that was my brother Solomon, if he hadn&#39;t made a</li>
<li class="L3962" rel="L3962">mistake in life.”</li>
<li class="L3963" rel="L3963"></li>
<li class="L3964" rel="L3964">Here again: Mr. Lorry&#39;s inquiries into Miss Pross&#39;s personal history had</li>
<li class="L3965" rel="L3965">established the fact that her brother Solomon was a heartless scoundrel</li>
<li class="L3966" rel="L3966">who had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake to</li>
<li class="L3967" rel="L3967">speculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore, with</li>
<li class="L3968" rel="L3968">no touch of compunction. Miss Pross&#39;s fidelity of belief in Solomon</li>
<li class="L3969" rel="L3969">(deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake) was quite a serious</li>
<li class="L3970" rel="L3970">matter with Mr. Lorry, and had its weight in his good opinion of her.</li>
<li class="L3971" rel="L3971"></li>
<li class="L3972" rel="L3972">“As we happen to be alone for the moment, and are both people of</li>
<li class="L3973" rel="L3973">business,” he said, when they had got back to the drawing-room and had</li>
<li class="L3974" rel="L3974">sat down there in friendly relations, “let me ask you--does the Doctor,</li>
<li class="L3975" rel="L3975">in talking with Lucie, never refer to the shoemaking time, yet?”</li>
<li class="L3976" rel="L3976"></li>
<li class="L3977" rel="L3977">“Never.”</li>
<li class="L3978" rel="L3978"></li>
<li class="L3979" rel="L3979">“And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?”</li>
<li class="L3980" rel="L3980"></li>
<li class="L3981" rel="L3981">“Ah!” returned Miss Pross, shaking her head. “But I don&#39;t say he don&#39;t</li>
<li class="L3982" rel="L3982">refer to it within himself.”</li>
<li class="L3983" rel="L3983"></li>
<li class="L3984" rel="L3984">“Do you believe that he thinks of it much?”</li>
<li class="L3985" rel="L3985"></li>
<li class="L3986" rel="L3986">“I do,” said Miss Pross.</li>
<li class="L3987" rel="L3987"></li>
<li class="L3988" rel="L3988">“Do you imagine--” Mr. Lorry had begun, when Miss Pross took him up</li>
<li class="L3989" rel="L3989">short with:</li>
<li class="L3990" rel="L3990"></li>
<li class="L3991" rel="L3991">“Never imagine anything. Have no imagination at all.”</li>
<li class="L3992" rel="L3992"></li>
<li class="L3993" rel="L3993">“I stand corrected; do you suppose--you go so far as to suppose,</li>
<li class="L3994" rel="L3994">sometimes?”</li>
<li class="L3995" rel="L3995"></li>
<li class="L3996" rel="L3996">“Now and then,” said Miss Pross.</li>
<li class="L3997" rel="L3997"></li>
<li class="L3998" rel="L3998">“Do you suppose,” Mr. Lorry went on, with a laughing twinkle in his</li>
<li class="L3999" rel="L3999">bright eye, as it looked kindly at her, “that Doctor Manette has any</li>
<li class="L4000" rel="L4000">theory of his own, preserved through all those years, relative to</li>
<li class="L4001" rel="L4001">the cause of his being so oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his</li>
<li class="L4002" rel="L4002">oppressor?”</li>
<li class="L4003" rel="L4003"></li>
<li class="L4004" rel="L4004">“I don&#39;t suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me.”</li>
<li class="L4005" rel="L4005"></li>
<li class="L4006" rel="L4006">“And that is--?”</li>
<li class="L4007" rel="L4007"></li>
<li class="L4008" rel="L4008">“That she thinks he has.”</li>
<li class="L4009" rel="L4009"></li>
<li class="L4010" rel="L4010">“Now don&#39;t be angry at my asking all these questions; because I am a</li>
<li class="L4011" rel="L4011">mere dull man of business, and you are a woman of business.”</li>
<li class="L4012" rel="L4012"></li>
<li class="L4013" rel="L4013">“Dull?” Miss Pross inquired, with placidity.</li>
<li class="L4014" rel="L4014"></li>
<li class="L4015" rel="L4015">Rather wishing his modest adjective away, Mr. Lorry replied, “No, no,</li>
<li class="L4016" rel="L4016">no. Surely not. To return to business:--Is it not remarkable that Doctor</li>
<li class="L4017" rel="L4017">Manette, unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured</li>
<li class="L4018" rel="L4018">he is, should never touch upon that question? I will not say with me,</li>
<li class="L4019" rel="L4019">though he had business relations with me many years ago, and we are now</li>
<li class="L4020" rel="L4020">intimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly</li>
<li class="L4021" rel="L4021">attached, and who is so devotedly attached to him? Believe me, Miss</li>
<li class="L4022" rel="L4022">Pross, I don&#39;t approach the topic with you, out of curiosity, but out of</li>
<li class="L4023" rel="L4023">zealous interest.”</li>
<li class="L4024" rel="L4024"></li>
<li class="L4025" rel="L4025">“Well! To the best of my understanding, and bad&#39;s the best, you&#39;ll tell</li>
<li class="L4026" rel="L4026">me,” said Miss Pross, softened by the tone of the apology, “he is afraid</li>
<li class="L4027" rel="L4027">of the whole subject.”</li>
<li class="L4028" rel="L4028"></li>
<li class="L4029" rel="L4029">“Afraid?”</li>
<li class="L4030" rel="L4030"></li>
<li class="L4031" rel="L4031">“It&#39;s plain enough, I should think, why he may be. It&#39;s a dreadful</li>
<li class="L4032" rel="L4032">remembrance. Besides that, his loss of himself grew out of it. Not</li>
<li class="L4033" rel="L4033">knowing how he lost himself, or how he recovered himself, he may never</li>
<li class="L4034" rel="L4034">feel certain of not losing himself again. That alone wouldn&#39;t make the</li>
<li class="L4035" rel="L4035">subject pleasant, I should think.”</li>
<li class="L4036" rel="L4036"></li>
<li class="L4037" rel="L4037">It was a profounder remark than Mr. Lorry had looked for. “True,” said</li>
<li class="L4038" rel="L4038">he, “and fearful to reflect upon. Yet, a doubt lurks in my mind, Miss</li>
<li class="L4039" rel="L4039">Pross, whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression</li>
<li class="L4040" rel="L4040">always shut up within him. Indeed, it is this doubt and the uneasiness</li>
<li class="L4041" rel="L4041">it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence.”</li>
<li class="L4042" rel="L4042"></li>
<li class="L4043" rel="L4043">“Can&#39;t be helped,” said Miss Pross, shaking her head. “Touch that</li>
<li class="L4044" rel="L4044">string, and he instantly changes for the worse. Better leave it alone.</li>
<li class="L4045" rel="L4045">In short, must leave it alone, like or no like. Sometimes, he gets up in</li>
<li class="L4046" rel="L4046">the dead of the night, and will be heard, by us overhead there, walking</li>
<li class="L4047" rel="L4047">up and down, walking up and down, in his room. Ladybird has learnt to</li>
<li class="L4048" rel="L4048">know then that his mind is walking up and down, walking up and down, in</li>
<li class="L4049" rel="L4049">his old prison. She hurries to him, and they go on together, walking up</li>
<li class="L4050" rel="L4050">and down, walking up and down, until he is composed. But he never says</li>
<li class="L4051" rel="L4051">a word of the true reason of his restlessness, to her, and she finds it</li>
<li class="L4052" rel="L4052">best not to hint at it to him. In silence they go walking up and down</li>
<li class="L4053" rel="L4053">together, walking up and down together, till her love and company have</li>
<li class="L4054" rel="L4054">brought him to himself.”</li>
<li class="L4055" rel="L4055"></li>
<li class="L4056" rel="L4056">Notwithstanding Miss Pross&#39;s denial of her own imagination, there was a</li>
<li class="L4057" rel="L4057">perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea,</li>
<li class="L4058" rel="L4058">in her repetition of the phrase, walking up and down, which testified to</li>
<li class="L4059" rel="L4059">her possessing such a thing.</li>
<li class="L4060" rel="L4060"></li>
<li class="L4061" rel="L4061">The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it</li>
<li class="L4062" rel="L4062">had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet, that it</li>
<li class="L4063" rel="L4063">seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had</li>
<li class="L4064" rel="L4064">set it going.</li>
<li class="L4065" rel="L4065"></li>
<li class="L4066" rel="L4066">“Here they are!” said Miss Pross, rising to break up the conference;</li>
<li class="L4067" rel="L4067">“and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!”</li>
<li class="L4068" rel="L4068"></li>
<li class="L4069" rel="L4069">It was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a</li>
<li class="L4070" rel="L4070">peculiar Ear of a place, that as Mr. Lorry stood at the open window,</li>
<li class="L4071" rel="L4071">looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard, he fancied</li>
<li class="L4072" rel="L4072">they would never approach. Not only would the echoes die away, as though</li>
<li class="L4073" rel="L4073">the steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be</li>
<li class="L4074" rel="L4074">heard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed close</li>
<li class="L4075" rel="L4075">at hand. However, father and daughter did at last appear, and Miss Pross</li>
<li class="L4076" rel="L4076">was ready at the street door to receive them.</li>
<li class="L4077" rel="L4077"></li>
<li class="L4078" rel="L4078">Miss Pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, taking</li>
<li class="L4079" rel="L4079">off her darling&#39;s bonnet when she came up-stairs, and touching it up</li>
<li class="L4080" rel="L4080">with the ends of her handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and</li>
<li class="L4081" rel="L4081">folding her mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing her rich hair with</li>
<li class="L4082" rel="L4082">as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she</li>
<li class="L4083" rel="L4083">had been the vainest and handsomest of women. Her darling was a pleasant</li>
<li class="L4084" rel="L4084">sight too, embracing her and thanking her, and protesting against</li>
<li class="L4085" rel="L4085">her taking so much trouble for her--which last she only dared to do</li>
<li class="L4086" rel="L4086">playfully, or Miss Pross, sorely hurt, would have retired to her own</li>
<li class="L4087" rel="L4087">chamber and cried. The Doctor was a pleasant sight too, looking on at</li>
<li class="L4088" rel="L4088">them, and telling Miss Pross how she spoilt Lucie, in accents and with</li>
<li class="L4089" rel="L4089">eyes that had as much spoiling in them as Miss Pross had, and would</li>
<li class="L4090" rel="L4090">have had more if it were possible. Mr. Lorry was a pleasant sight too,</li>
<li class="L4091" rel="L4091">beaming at all this in his little wig, and thanking his bachelor</li>
<li class="L4092" rel="L4092">stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a Home. But, no</li>
<li class="L4093" rel="L4093">Hundreds of people came to see the sights, and Mr. Lorry looked in vain</li>
<li class="L4094" rel="L4094">for the fulfilment of Miss Pross&#39;s prediction.</li>
<li class="L4095" rel="L4095"></li>
<li class="L4096" rel="L4096">Dinner-time, and still no Hundreds of people. In the arrangements of</li>
<li class="L4097" rel="L4097">the little household, Miss Pross took charge of the lower regions, and</li>
<li class="L4098" rel="L4098">always acquitted herself marvellously. Her dinners, of a very modest</li>
<li class="L4099" rel="L4099">quality, were so well cooked and so well served, and so neat in their</li>
<li class="L4100" rel="L4100">contrivances, half English and half French, that nothing could be</li>
<li class="L4101" rel="L4101">better. Miss Pross&#39;s friendship being of the thoroughly practical</li>
<li class="L4102" rel="L4102">kind, she had ravaged Soho and the adjacent provinces, in search of</li>
<li class="L4103" rel="L4103">impoverished French, who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns, would</li>
<li class="L4104" rel="L4104">impart culinary mysteries to her. From these decayed sons and daughters</li>
<li class="L4105" rel="L4105">of Gaul, she had acquired such wonderful arts, that the woman and girl</li>
<li class="L4106" rel="L4106">who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a Sorceress,</li>
<li class="L4107" rel="L4107">or Cinderella&#39;s Godmother: who would send out for a fowl, a rabbit,</li>
<li class="L4108" rel="L4108">a vegetable or two from the garden, and change them into anything she</li>
<li class="L4109" rel="L4109">pleased.</li>
<li class="L4110" rel="L4110"></li>
<li class="L4111" rel="L4111">On Sundays, Miss Pross dined at the Doctor&#39;s table, but on other days</li>
<li class="L4112" rel="L4112">persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods, either in the lower</li>
<li class="L4113" rel="L4113">regions, or in her own room on the second floor--a blue chamber, to</li>
<li class="L4114" rel="L4114">which no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance. On this occasion,</li>
<li class="L4115" rel="L4115">Miss Pross, responding to Ladybird&#39;s pleasant face and pleasant efforts</li>
<li class="L4116" rel="L4116">to please her, unbent exceedingly; so the dinner was very pleasant, too.</li>
<li class="L4117" rel="L4117"></li>
<li class="L4118" rel="L4118">It was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, Lucie proposed that the</li>
<li class="L4119" rel="L4119">wine should be carried out under the plane-tree, and they should sit</li>
<li class="L4120" rel="L4120">there in the air. As everything turned upon her, and revolved about her,</li>
<li class="L4121" rel="L4121">they went out under the plane-tree, and she carried the wine down for</li>
<li class="L4122" rel="L4122">the special benefit of Mr. Lorry. She had installed herself, some</li>
<li class="L4123" rel="L4123">time before, as Mr. Lorry&#39;s cup-bearer; and while they sat under the</li>
<li class="L4124" rel="L4124">plane-tree, talking, she kept his glass replenished. Mysterious backs</li>
<li class="L4125" rel="L4125">and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked, and the plane-tree</li>
<li class="L4126" rel="L4126">whispered to them in its own way above their heads.</li>
<li class="L4127" rel="L4127"></li>
<li class="L4128" rel="L4128">Still, the Hundreds of people did not present themselves. Mr. Darnay</li>
<li class="L4129" rel="L4129">presented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree, but he</li>
<li class="L4130" rel="L4130">was only One.</li>
<li class="L4131" rel="L4131"></li>
<li class="L4132" rel="L4132">Doctor Manette received him kindly, and so did Lucie. But, Miss Pross</li>
<li class="L4133" rel="L4133">suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body, and</li>
<li class="L4134" rel="L4134">retired into the house. She was not unfrequently the victim of this</li>
<li class="L4135" rel="L4135">disorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, “a fit of the</li>
<li class="L4136" rel="L4136">jerks.”</li>
<li class="L4137" rel="L4137"></li>
<li class="L4138" rel="L4138">The Doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young. The</li>
<li class="L4139" rel="L4139">resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times, and as</li>
<li class="L4140" rel="L4140">they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting</li>
<li class="L4141" rel="L4141">his arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the</li>
<li class="L4142" rel="L4142">likeness.</li>
<li class="L4143" rel="L4143"></li>
<li class="L4144" rel="L4144">He had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual</li>
<li class="L4145" rel="L4145">vivacity. “Pray, Doctor Manette,” said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under the</li>
<li class="L4146" rel="L4146">plane-tree--and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand,</li>
<li class="L4147" rel="L4147">which happened to be the old buildings of London--“have you seen much of</li>
<li class="L4148" rel="L4148">the Tower?”</li>
<li class="L4149" rel="L4149"></li>
<li class="L4150" rel="L4150">“Lucie and I have been there; but only casually. We have seen enough of</li>
<li class="L4151" rel="L4151">it, to know that it teems with interest; little more.”</li>
<li class="L4152" rel="L4152"></li>
<li class="L4153" rel="L4153">“_I_ have been there, as you remember,” said Darnay, with a smile,</li>
<li class="L4154" rel="L4154">though reddening a little angrily, “in another character, and not in a</li>
<li class="L4155" rel="L4155">character that gives facilities for seeing much of it. They told me a</li>
<li class="L4156" rel="L4156">curious thing when I was there.”</li>
<li class="L4157" rel="L4157"></li>
<li class="L4158" rel="L4158">“What was that?” Lucie asked.</li>
<li class="L4159" rel="L4159"></li>
<li class="L4160" rel="L4160">“In making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which</li>
<li class="L4161" rel="L4161">had been, for many years, built up and forgotten. Every stone of</li>
<li class="L4162" rel="L4162">its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by</li>
<li class="L4163" rel="L4163">prisoners--dates, names, complaints, and prayers. Upon a corner stone</li>
<li class="L4164" rel="L4164">in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone to</li>
<li class="L4165" rel="L4165">execution, had cut as his last work, three letters. They were done with</li>
<li class="L4166" rel="L4166">some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady hand.</li>
<li class="L4167" rel="L4167">At first, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more carefully</li>
<li class="L4168" rel="L4168">examined, the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or</li>
<li class="L4169" rel="L4169">legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses</li>
<li class="L4170" rel="L4170">were made what the name could have been. At length, it was suggested</li>
<li class="L4171" rel="L4171">that the letters were not initials, but the complete word, DIG. The</li>
<li class="L4172" rel="L4172">floor was examined very carefully under the inscription, and, in the</li>
<li class="L4173" rel="L4173">earth beneath a stone, or tile, or some fragment of paving, were found</li>
<li class="L4174" rel="L4174">the ashes of a paper, mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case</li>
<li class="L4175" rel="L4175">or bag. What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read, but he</li>
<li class="L4176" rel="L4176">had written something, and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler.”</li>
<li class="L4177" rel="L4177"></li>
<li class="L4178" rel="L4178">“My father,” exclaimed Lucie, “you are ill!”</li>
<li class="L4179" rel="L4179"></li>
<li class="L4180" rel="L4180">He had suddenly started up, with his hand to his head. His manner and</li>
<li class="L4181" rel="L4181">his look quite terrified them all.</li>
<li class="L4182" rel="L4182"></li>
<li class="L4183" rel="L4183">“No, my dear, not ill. There are large drops of rain falling, and they</li>
<li class="L4184" rel="L4184">made me start. We had better go in.”</li>
<li class="L4185" rel="L4185"></li>
<li class="L4186" rel="L4186">He recovered himself almost instantly. Rain was really falling in large</li>
<li class="L4187" rel="L4187">drops, and he showed the back of his hand with rain-drops on it. But, he</li>
<li class="L4188" rel="L4188">said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told</li>
<li class="L4189" rel="L4189">of, and, as they went into the house, the business eye of Mr. Lorry</li>
<li class="L4190" rel="L4190">either detected, or fancied it detected, on his face, as it turned</li>
<li class="L4191" rel="L4191">towards Charles Darnay, the same singular look that had been upon it</li>
<li class="L4192" rel="L4192">when it turned towards him in the passages of the Court House.</li>
<li class="L4193" rel="L4193"></li>
<li class="L4194" rel="L4194">He recovered himself so quickly, however, that Mr. Lorry had doubts of</li>
<li class="L4195" rel="L4195">his business eye. The arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more</li>
<li class="L4196" rel="L4196">steady than he was, when he stopped under it to remark to them that he</li>
<li class="L4197" rel="L4197">was not yet proof against slight surprises (if he ever would be), and</li>
<li class="L4198" rel="L4198">that the rain had startled him.</li>
<li class="L4199" rel="L4199"></li>
<li class="L4200" rel="L4200">Tea-time, and Miss Pross making tea, with another fit of the jerks upon</li>
<li class="L4201" rel="L4201">her, and yet no Hundreds of people. Mr. Carton had lounged in, but he</li>
<li class="L4202" rel="L4202">made only Two.</li>
<li class="L4203" rel="L4203"></li>
<li class="L4204" rel="L4204">The night was so very sultry, that although they sat with doors and</li>
<li class="L4205" rel="L4205">windows open, they were overpowered by heat. When the tea-table was</li>
<li class="L4206" rel="L4206">done with, they all moved to one of the windows, and looked out into the</li>
<li class="L4207" rel="L4207">heavy twilight. Lucie sat by her father; Darnay sat beside her; Carton</li>
<li class="L4208" rel="L4208">leaned against a window. The curtains were long and white, and some of</li>
<li class="L4209" rel="L4209">the thunder-gusts that whirled into the corner, caught them up to the</li>
<li class="L4210" rel="L4210">ceiling, and waved them like spectral wings.</li>
<li class="L4211" rel="L4211"></li>
<li class="L4212" rel="L4212">“The rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few,” said Doctor</li>
<li class="L4213" rel="L4213">Manette. “It comes slowly.”</li>
<li class="L4214" rel="L4214"></li>
<li class="L4215" rel="L4215">“It comes surely,” said Carton.</li>
<li class="L4216" rel="L4216"></li>
<li class="L4217" rel="L4217">They spoke low, as people watching and waiting mostly do; as people in a</li>
<li class="L4218" rel="L4218">dark room, watching and waiting for Lightning, always do.</li>
<li class="L4219" rel="L4219"></li>
<li class="L4220" rel="L4220">There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to</li>
<li class="L4221" rel="L4221">get shelter before the storm broke; the wonderful corner for echoes</li>
<li class="L4222" rel="L4222">resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a</li>
<li class="L4223" rel="L4223">footstep was there.</li>
<li class="L4224" rel="L4224"></li>
<li class="L4225" rel="L4225">“A multitude of people, and yet a solitude!” said Darnay, when they had</li>
<li class="L4226" rel="L4226">listened for a while.</li>
<li class="L4227" rel="L4227"></li>
<li class="L4228" rel="L4228">“Is it not impressive, Mr. Darnay?” asked Lucie. “Sometimes, I have</li>
<li class="L4229" rel="L4229">sat here of an evening, until I have fancied--but even the shade of</li>
<li class="L4230" rel="L4230">a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night, when all is so black and</li>
<li class="L4231" rel="L4231">solemn--”</li>
<li class="L4232" rel="L4232"></li>
<li class="L4233" rel="L4233">“Let us shudder too. We may know what it is.”</li>
<li class="L4234" rel="L4234"></li>
<li class="L4235" rel="L4235">“It will seem nothing to you. Such whims are only impressive as we</li>
<li class="L4236" rel="L4236">originate them, I think; they are not to be communicated. I have</li>
<li class="L4237" rel="L4237">sometimes sat alone here of an evening, listening, until I have made</li>
<li class="L4238" rel="L4238">the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming</li>
<li class="L4239" rel="L4239">by-and-bye into our lives.”</li>
<li class="L4240" rel="L4240"></li>
<li class="L4241" rel="L4241">“There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives, if that be so,”</li>
<li class="L4242" rel="L4242"> Sydney Carton struck in, in his moody way.</li>
<li class="L4243" rel="L4243"></li>
<li class="L4244" rel="L4244">The footsteps were incessant, and the hurry of them became more and more</li>
<li class="L4245" rel="L4245">rapid. The corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet; some,</li>
<li class="L4246" rel="L4246">as it seemed, under the windows; some, as it seemed, in the room; some</li>
<li class="L4247" rel="L4247">coming, some going, some breaking off, some stopping altogether; all in</li>
<li class="L4248" rel="L4248">the distant streets, and not one within sight.</li>
<li class="L4249" rel="L4249"></li>
<li class="L4250" rel="L4250">“Are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us, Miss Manette, or</li>
<li class="L4251" rel="L4251">are we to divide them among us?”</li>
<li class="L4252" rel="L4252"></li>
<li class="L4253" rel="L4253">“I don&#39;t know, Mr. Darnay; I told you it was a foolish fancy, but you</li>
<li class="L4254" rel="L4254">asked for it. When I have yielded myself to it, I have been alone, and</li>
<li class="L4255" rel="L4255">then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come</li>
<li class="L4256" rel="L4256">into my life, and my father&#39;s.”</li>
<li class="L4257" rel="L4257"></li>
<li class="L4258" rel="L4258">“I take them into mine!” said Carton. “_I_ ask no questions and make no</li>
<li class="L4259" rel="L4259">stipulations. There is a great crowd bearing down upon us, Miss Manette,</li>
<li class="L4260" rel="L4260">and I see them--by the Lightning.” He added the last words, after there</li>
<li class="L4261" rel="L4261">had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window.</li>
<li class="L4262" rel="L4262"></li>
<li class="L4263" rel="L4263">“And I hear them!” he added again, after a peal of thunder. “Here they</li>
<li class="L4264" rel="L4264">come, fast, fierce, and furious!”</li>
<li class="L4265" rel="L4265"></li>
<li class="L4266" rel="L4266">It was the rush and roar of rain that he typified, and it stopped him,</li>
<li class="L4267" rel="L4267">for no voice could be heard in it. A memorable storm of thunder and</li>
<li class="L4268" rel="L4268">lightning broke with that sweep of water, and there was not a moment&#39;s</li>
<li class="L4269" rel="L4269">interval in crash, and fire, and rain, until after the moon rose at</li>
<li class="L4270" rel="L4270">midnight.</li>
<li class="L4271" rel="L4271"></li>
<li class="L4272" rel="L4272">The great bell of Saint Paul&#39;s was striking one in the cleared air, when</li>
<li class="L4273" rel="L4273">Mr. Lorry, escorted by Jerry, high-booted and bearing a lantern, set</li>
<li class="L4274" rel="L4274">forth on his return-passage to Clerkenwell. There were solitary patches</li>
<li class="L4275" rel="L4275">of road on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell, and Mr. Lorry, mindful</li>
<li class="L4276" rel="L4276">of foot-pads, always retained Jerry for this service: though it was</li>
<li class="L4277" rel="L4277">usually performed a good two hours earlier.</li>
<li class="L4278" rel="L4278"></li>
<li class="L4279" rel="L4279">“What a night it has been! Almost a night, Jerry,” said Mr. Lorry, “to</li>
<li class="L4280" rel="L4280">bring the dead out of their graves.”</li>
<li class="L4281" rel="L4281"></li>
<li class="L4282" rel="L4282">“I never see the night myself, master--nor yet I don&#39;t expect to--what</li>
<li class="L4283" rel="L4283">would do that,” answered Jerry.</li>
<li class="L4284" rel="L4284"></li>
<li class="L4285" rel="L4285">“Good night, Mr. Carton,” said the man of business. “Good night, Mr.</li>
<li class="L4286" rel="L4286">Darnay. Shall we ever see such a night again, together!”</li>
<li class="L4287" rel="L4287"></li>
<li class="L4288" rel="L4288">Perhaps. Perhaps, see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar,</li>
<li class="L4289" rel="L4289">bearing down upon them, too.</li>
<li class="L4290" rel="L4290"></li>
<li class="L4291" rel="L4291"></li>
<li class="L4292" rel="L4292"></li>
<li class="L4293" rel="L4293"></li>
<li class="L4294" rel="L4294">VII. Monseigneur in Town</li>
<li class="L4295" rel="L4295"></li>
<li class="L4296" rel="L4296"></li>
<li class="L4297" rel="L4297">Monseigneur, one of the great lords in power at the Court, held his</li>
<li class="L4298" rel="L4298">fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in Paris. Monseigneur was in</li>
<li class="L4299" rel="L4299">his inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to</li>
<li class="L4300" rel="L4300">the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without. Monseigneur</li>
<li class="L4301" rel="L4301">was about to take his chocolate. Monseigneur could swallow a great many</li>
<li class="L4302" rel="L4302">things with ease, and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather</li>
<li class="L4303" rel="L4303">rapidly swallowing France; but, his morning&#39;s chocolate could not so</li>
<li class="L4304" rel="L4304">much as get into the throat of Monseigneur, without the aid of four</li>
<li class="L4305" rel="L4305">strong men besides the Cook.</li>
<li class="L4306" rel="L4306"></li>
<li class="L4307" rel="L4307">Yes. It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and the</li>
<li class="L4308" rel="L4308">Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his</li>
<li class="L4309" rel="L4309">pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to</li>
<li class="L4310" rel="L4310">conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur&#39;s lips. One lacquey carried</li>
<li class="L4311" rel="L4311">the chocolate-pot into the sacred presence; a second, milled and frothed</li>
<li class="L4312" rel="L4312">the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function;</li>
<li class="L4313" rel="L4313">a third, presented the favoured napkin; a fourth (he of the two gold</li>
<li class="L4314" rel="L4314">watches), poured the chocolate out. It was impossible for Monseigneur to</li>
<li class="L4315" rel="L4315">dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high</li>
<li class="L4316" rel="L4316">place under the admiring Heavens. Deep would have been the blot upon</li>
<li class="L4317" rel="L4317">his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three</li>
<li class="L4318" rel="L4318">men; he must have died of two.</li>
<li class="L4319" rel="L4319"></li>
<li class="L4320" rel="L4320">Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night, where the Comedy</li>
<li class="L4321" rel="L4321">and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented. Monseigneur was out at</li>
<li class="L4322" rel="L4322">a little supper most nights, with fascinating company. So polite and so</li>
<li class="L4323" rel="L4323">impressible was Monseigneur, that the Comedy and the Grand Opera had far</li>
<li class="L4324" rel="L4324">more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and</li>
<li class="L4325" rel="L4325">state secrets, than the needs of all France. A happy circumstance</li>
<li class="L4326" rel="L4326">for France, as the like always is for all countries similarly</li>
<li class="L4327" rel="L4327">favoured!--always was for England (by way of example), in the regretted</li>
<li class="L4328" rel="L4328">days of the merry Stuart who sold it.</li>
<li class="L4329" rel="L4329"></li>
<li class="L4330" rel="L4330">Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business, which</li>
<li class="L4331" rel="L4331">was, to let everything go on in its own way; of particular public</li>
<li class="L4332" rel="L4332">business, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go</li>
<li class="L4333" rel="L4333">his way--tend to his own power and pocket. Of his pleasures, general and</li>
<li class="L4334" rel="L4334">particular, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea, that the world</li>
<li class="L4335" rel="L4335">was made for them. The text of his order (altered from the original</li>
<li class="L4336" rel="L4336">by only a pronoun, which is not much) ran: “The earth and the fulness</li>
<li class="L4337" rel="L4337">thereof are mine, saith Monseigneur.”</li>
<li class="L4338" rel="L4338"></li>
<li class="L4339" rel="L4339">Yet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into</li>
<li class="L4340" rel="L4340">his affairs, both private and public; and he had, as to both classes of</li>
<li class="L4341" rel="L4341">affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General. As to finances</li>
<li class="L4342" rel="L4342">public, because Monseigneur could not make anything at all of them, and</li>
<li class="L4343" rel="L4343">must consequently let them out to somebody who could; as to finances</li>
<li class="L4344" rel="L4344">private, because Farmer-Generals were rich, and Monseigneur, after</li>
<li class="L4345" rel="L4345">generations of great luxury and expense, was growing poor. Hence</li>
<li class="L4346" rel="L4346">Monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent, while there was yet</li>
<li class="L4347" rel="L4347">time to ward off the impending veil, the cheapest garment she could</li>
<li class="L4348" rel="L4348">wear, and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich Farmer-General,</li>
<li class="L4349" rel="L4349">poor in family. Which Farmer-General, carrying an appropriate cane with</li>
<li class="L4350" rel="L4350">a golden apple on the top of it, was now among the company in the outer</li>
<li class="L4351" rel="L4351">rooms, much prostrated before by mankind--always excepting superior</li>
<li class="L4352" rel="L4352">mankind of the blood of Monseigneur, who, his own wife included, looked</li>
<li class="L4353" rel="L4353">down upon him with the loftiest contempt.</li>
<li class="L4354" rel="L4354"></li>
<li class="L4355" rel="L4355">A sumptuous man was the Farmer-General. Thirty horses stood in his</li>
<li class="L4356" rel="L4356">stables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls, six body-women</li>
<li class="L4357" rel="L4357">waited on his wife. As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and</li>
<li class="L4358" rel="L4358">forage where he could, the Farmer-General--howsoever his matrimonial</li>
<li class="L4359" rel="L4359">relations conduced to social morality--was at least the greatest reality</li>
<li class="L4360" rel="L4360">among the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur that day.</li>
<li class="L4361" rel="L4361"></li>
<li class="L4362" rel="L4362">For, the rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned with</li>
<li class="L4363" rel="L4363">every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could</li>
<li class="L4364" rel="L4364">achieve, were, in truth, not a sound business; considered with any</li>
<li class="L4365" rel="L4365">reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere (and not</li>
<li class="L4366" rel="L4366">so far off, either, but that the watching towers of Notre Dame, almost</li>
<li class="L4367" rel="L4367">equidistant from the two extremes, could see them both), they would</li>
<li class="L4368" rel="L4368">have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business--if that could have</li>
<li class="L4369" rel="L4369">been anybody&#39;s business, at the house of Monseigneur. Military officers</li>
<li class="L4370" rel="L4370">destitute of military knowledge; naval officers with no idea of a ship;</li>
<li class="L4371" rel="L4371">civil officers without a notion of affairs; brazen ecclesiastics, of the</li>
<li class="L4372" rel="L4372">worst world worldly, with sensual eyes, loose tongues, and looser lives;</li>
<li class="L4373" rel="L4373">all totally unfit for their several callings, all lying horribly in</li>
<li class="L4374" rel="L4374">pretending to belong to them, but all nearly or remotely of the order of</li>
<li class="L4375" rel="L4375">Monseigneur, and therefore foisted on all public employments from which</li>
<li class="L4376" rel="L4376">anything was to be got; these were to be told off by the score and the</li>
<li class="L4377" rel="L4377">score. People not immediately connected with Monseigneur or the State,</li>
<li class="L4378" rel="L4378">yet equally unconnected with anything that was real, or with lives</li>
<li class="L4379" rel="L4379">passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end, were</li>
<li class="L4380" rel="L4380">no less abundant. Doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies</li>
<li class="L4381" rel="L4381">for imaginary disorders that never existed, smiled upon their courtly</li>
<li class="L4382" rel="L4382">patients in the ante-chambers of Monseigneur. Projectors who had</li>
<li class="L4383" rel="L4383">discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the</li>
<li class="L4384" rel="L4384">State was touched, except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to</li>
<li class="L4385" rel="L4385">root out a single sin, poured their distracting babble into any ears</li>
<li class="L4386" rel="L4386">they could lay hold of, at the reception of Monseigneur. Unbelieving</li>
<li class="L4387" rel="L4387">Philosophers who were remodelling the world with words, and making</li>
<li class="L4388" rel="L4388">card-towers of Babel to scale the skies with, talked with Unbelieving</li>
<li class="L4389" rel="L4389">Chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals, at this</li>
<li class="L4390" rel="L4390">wonderful gathering accumulated by Monseigneur. Exquisite gentlemen of</li>
<li class="L4391" rel="L4391">the finest breeding, which was at that remarkable time--and has been</li>
<li class="L4392" rel="L4392">since--to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural</li>
<li class="L4393" rel="L4393">subject of human interest, were in the most exemplary state of</li>
<li class="L4394" rel="L4394">exhaustion, at the hotel of Monseigneur. Such homes had these various</li>
<li class="L4395" rel="L4395">notabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paris, that the spies</li>
<li class="L4396" rel="L4396">among the assembled devotees of Monseigneur--forming a goodly half</li>
<li class="L4397" rel="L4397">of the polite company--would have found it hard to discover among</li>
<li class="L4398" rel="L4398">the angels of that sphere one solitary wife, who, in her manners and</li>
<li class="L4399" rel="L4399">appearance, owned to being a Mother. Indeed, except for the mere act of</li>
<li class="L4400" rel="L4400">bringing a troublesome creature into this world--which does not go far</li>
<li class="L4401" rel="L4401">towards the realisation of the name of mother--there was no such thing</li>
<li class="L4402" rel="L4402">known to the fashion. Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close,</li>
<li class="L4403" rel="L4403">and brought them up, and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and</li>
<li class="L4404" rel="L4404">supped as at twenty.</li>
<li class="L4405" rel="L4405"></li>
<li class="L4406" rel="L4406">The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance</li>
<li class="L4407" rel="L4407">upon Monseigneur. In the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional</li>
<li class="L4408" rel="L4408">people who had had, for a few years, some vague misgiving in them that</li>
<li class="L4409" rel="L4409">things in general were going rather wrong. As a promising way of setting</li>
<li class="L4410" rel="L4410">them right, half of the half-dozen had become members of a fantastic</li>
<li class="L4411" rel="L4411">sect of Convulsionists, and were even then considering within themselves</li>
<li class="L4412" rel="L4412">whether they should foam, rage, roar, and turn cataleptic on the</li>
<li class="L4413" rel="L4413">spot--thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger-post to the</li>
<li class="L4414" rel="L4414">Future, for Monseigneur&#39;s guidance. Besides these Dervishes, were other</li>
<li class="L4415" rel="L4415">three who had rushed into another sect, which mended matters with a</li>
<li class="L4416" rel="L4416">jargon about “the Centre of Truth:” holding that Man had got out of the</li>
<li class="L4417" rel="L4417">Centre of Truth--which did not need much demonstration--but had not got</li>
<li class="L4418" rel="L4418">out of the Circumference, and that he was to be kept from flying out of</li>
<li class="L4419" rel="L4419">the Circumference, and was even to be shoved back into the Centre,</li>
<li class="L4420" rel="L4420">by fasting and seeing of spirits. Among these, accordingly, much</li>
<li class="L4421" rel="L4421">discoursing with spirits went on--and it did a world of good which never</li>
<li class="L4422" rel="L4422">became manifest.</li>
<li class="L4423" rel="L4423"></li>
<li class="L4424" rel="L4424">But, the comfort was, that all the company at the grand hotel of</li>
<li class="L4425" rel="L4425">Monseigneur were perfectly dressed. If the Day of Judgment had only been</li>
<li class="L4426" rel="L4426">ascertained to be a dress day, everybody there would have been eternally</li>
<li class="L4427" rel="L4427">correct. Such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair, such</li>
<li class="L4428" rel="L4428">delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended, such gallant</li>
<li class="L4429" rel="L4429">swords to look at, and such delicate honour to the sense of smell, would</li>
<li class="L4430" rel="L4430">surely keep anything going, for ever and ever. The exquisite gentlemen</li>
<li class="L4431" rel="L4431">of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they</li>
<li class="L4432" rel="L4432">languidly moved; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells;</li>
<li class="L4433" rel="L4433">and what with that ringing, and with the rustle of silk and brocade and</li>
<li class="L4434" rel="L4434">fine linen, there was a flutter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and</li>
<li class="L4435" rel="L4435">his devouring hunger far away.</li>
<li class="L4436" rel="L4436"></li>
<li class="L4437" rel="L4437">Dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all</li>
<li class="L4438" rel="L4438">things in their places. Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that</li>
<li class="L4439" rel="L4439">was never to leave off. From the Palace of the Tuileries, through</li>
<li class="L4440" rel="L4440">Monseigneur and the whole Court, through the Chambers, the Tribunals</li>
<li class="L4441" rel="L4441">of Justice, and all society (except the scarecrows), the Fancy Ball</li>
<li class="L4442" rel="L4442">descended to the Common Executioner: who, in pursuance of the charm, was</li>
<li class="L4443" rel="L4443">required to officiate “frizzled, powdered, in a gold-laced coat, pumps,</li>
<li class="L4444" rel="L4444">and white silk stockings.” At the gallows and the wheel--the axe was a</li>
<li class="L4445" rel="L4445">rarity--Monsieur Paris, as it was the episcopal mode among his brother</li>
<li class="L4446" rel="L4446">Professors of the provinces, Monsieur Orleans, and the rest, to call</li>
<li class="L4447" rel="L4447">him, presided in this dainty dress. And who among the company at</li>
<li class="L4448" rel="L4448">Monseigneur&#39;s reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year</li>
<li class="L4449" rel="L4449">of our Lord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a frizzled</li>
<li class="L4450" rel="L4450">hangman, powdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk stockinged, would</li>
<li class="L4451" rel="L4451">see the very stars out!</li>
<li class="L4452" rel="L4452"></li>
<li class="L4453" rel="L4453">Monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his</li>
<li class="L4454" rel="L4454">chocolate, caused the doors of the Holiest of Holiests to be thrown</li>
<li class="L4455" rel="L4455">open, and issued forth. Then, what submission, what cringing and</li>
<li class="L4456" rel="L4456">fawning, what servility, what abject humiliation! As to bowing down in</li>
<li class="L4457" rel="L4457">body and spirit, nothing in that way was left for Heaven--which may have</li>
<li class="L4458" rel="L4458">been one among other reasons why the worshippers of Monseigneur never</li>
<li class="L4459" rel="L4459">troubled it.</li>
<li class="L4460" rel="L4460"></li>
<li class="L4461" rel="L4461">Bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there, a whisper on one</li>
<li class="L4462" rel="L4462">happy slave and a wave of the hand on another, Monseigneur affably</li>
<li class="L4463" rel="L4463">passed through his rooms to the remote region of the Circumference of</li>
<li class="L4464" rel="L4464">Truth. There, Monseigneur turned, and came back again, and so in due</li>
<li class="L4465" rel="L4465">course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate</li>
<li class="L4466" rel="L4466">sprites, and was seen no more.</li>
<li class="L4467" rel="L4467"></li>
<li class="L4468" rel="L4468">The show being over, the flutter in the air became quite a little storm,</li>
<li class="L4469" rel="L4469">and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs. There was soon</li>
<li class="L4470" rel="L4470">but one person left of all the crowd, and he, with his hat under his arm</li>
<li class="L4471" rel="L4471">and his snuff-box in his hand, slowly passed among the mirrors on his</li>
<li class="L4472" rel="L4472">way out.</li>
<li class="L4473" rel="L4473"></li>
<li class="L4474" rel="L4474">“I devote you,” said this person, stopping at the last door on his way,</li>
<li class="L4475" rel="L4475">and turning in the direction of the sanctuary, “to the Devil!”</li>
<li class="L4476" rel="L4476"></li>
<li class="L4477" rel="L4477">With that, he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the</li>
<li class="L4478" rel="L4478">dust from his feet, and quietly walked downstairs.</li>
<li class="L4479" rel="L4479"></li>
<li class="L4480" rel="L4480">He was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and</li>
<li class="L4481" rel="L4481">with a face like a fine mask. A face of a transparent paleness; every</li>
<li class="L4482" rel="L4482">feature in it clearly defined; one set expression on it. The nose,</li>
<li class="L4483" rel="L4483">beautifully formed otherwise, was very slightly pinched at the top</li>
<li class="L4484" rel="L4484">of each nostril. In those two compressions, or dints, the only little</li>
<li class="L4485" rel="L4485">change that the face ever showed, resided. They persisted in changing</li>
<li class="L4486" rel="L4486">colour sometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted</li>
<li class="L4487" rel="L4487">by something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of</li>
<li class="L4488" rel="L4488">treachery, and cruelty, to the whole countenance. Examined with</li>
<li class="L4489" rel="L4489">attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the</li>
<li class="L4490" rel="L4490">line of the mouth, and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much</li>
<li class="L4491" rel="L4491">too horizontal and thin; still, in the effect of the face made, it was a</li>
<li class="L4492" rel="L4492">handsome face, and a remarkable one.</li>
<li class="L4493" rel="L4493"></li>
<li class="L4494" rel="L4494">Its owner went downstairs into the courtyard, got into his carriage, and</li>
<li class="L4495" rel="L4495">drove away. Not many people had talked with him at the reception; he had</li>
<li class="L4496" rel="L4496">stood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been warmer</li>
<li class="L4497" rel="L4497">in his manner. It appeared, under the circumstances, rather agreeable</li>
<li class="L4498" rel="L4498">to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses, and</li>
<li class="L4499" rel="L4499">often barely escaping from being run down. His man drove as if he were</li>
<li class="L4500" rel="L4500">charging an enemy, and the furious recklessness of the man brought no</li>
<li class="L4501" rel="L4501">check into the face, or to the lips, of the master. The complaint had</li>
<li class="L4502" rel="L4502">sometimes made itself audible, even in that deaf city and dumb age,</li>
<li class="L4503" rel="L4503">that, in the narrow streets without footways, the fierce patrician</li>
<li class="L4504" rel="L4504">custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a</li>
<li class="L4505" rel="L4505">barbarous manner. But, few cared enough for that to think of it a second</li>
<li class="L4506" rel="L4506">time, and, in this matter, as in all others, the common wretches were</li>
<li class="L4507" rel="L4507">left to get out of their difficulties as they could.</li>
<li class="L4508" rel="L4508"></li>
<li class="L4509" rel="L4509">With a wild rattle and clatter, and an inhuman abandonment of</li>
<li class="L4510" rel="L4510">consideration not easy to be understood in these days, the carriage</li>
<li class="L4511" rel="L4511">dashed through streets and swept round corners, with women screaming</li>
<li class="L4512" rel="L4512">before it, and men clutching each other and clutching children out of</li>
<li class="L4513" rel="L4513">its way. At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its</li>
<li class="L4514" rel="L4514">wheels came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a</li>
<li class="L4515" rel="L4515">number of voices, and the horses reared and plunged.</li>
<li class="L4516" rel="L4516"></li>
<li class="L4517" rel="L4517">But for the latter inconvenience, the carriage probably would not have</li>
<li class="L4518" rel="L4518">stopped; carriages were often known to drive on, and leave their wounded</li>
<li class="L4519" rel="L4519">behind, and why not? But the frightened valet had got down in a hurry,</li>
<li class="L4520" rel="L4520">and there were twenty hands at the horses&#39; bridles.</li>
<li class="L4521" rel="L4521"></li>
<li class="L4522" rel="L4522">“What has gone wrong?” said Monsieur, calmly looking out.</li>
<li class="L4523" rel="L4523"></li>
<li class="L4524" rel="L4524">A tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of</li>
<li class="L4525" rel="L4525">the horses, and had laid it on the basement of the fountain, and was</li>
<li class="L4526" rel="L4526">down in the mud and wet, howling over it like a wild animal.</li>
<li class="L4527" rel="L4527"></li>
<li class="L4528" rel="L4528">“Pardon, Monsieur the Marquis!” said a ragged and submissive man, “it is</li>
<li class="L4529" rel="L4529">a child.”</li>
<li class="L4530" rel="L4530"></li>
<li class="L4531" rel="L4531">“Why does he make that abominable noise? Is it his child?”</li>
<li class="L4532" rel="L4532"></li>
<li class="L4533" rel="L4533">“Excuse me, Monsieur the Marquis--it is a pity--yes.”</li>
<li class="L4534" rel="L4534"></li>
<li class="L4535" rel="L4535">The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was,</li>
<li class="L4536" rel="L4536">into a space some ten or twelve yards square. As the tall man suddenly</li>
<li class="L4537" rel="L4537">got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the</li>
<li class="L4538" rel="L4538">Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt.</li>
<li class="L4539" rel="L4539"></li>
<li class="L4540" rel="L4540">“Killed!” shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at</li>
<li class="L4541" rel="L4541">their length above his head, and staring at him. “Dead!”</li>
<li class="L4542" rel="L4542"></li>
<li class="L4543" rel="L4543">The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis. There was</li>
<li class="L4544" rel="L4544">nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness</li>
<li class="L4545" rel="L4545">and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger. Neither did the</li>
<li class="L4546" rel="L4546">people say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they</li>
<li class="L4547" rel="L4547">remained so. The voice of the submissive man who had spoken, was flat</li>
<li class="L4548" rel="L4548">and tame in its extreme submission. Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes</li>
<li class="L4549" rel="L4549">over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes.</li>
<li class="L4550" rel="L4550"></li>
<li class="L4551" rel="L4551">He took out his purse.</li>
<li class="L4552" rel="L4552"></li>
<li class="L4553" rel="L4553">“It is extraordinary to me,” said he, “that you people cannot take care</li>
<li class="L4554" rel="L4554">of yourselves and your children. One or the other of you is for ever in</li>
<li class="L4555" rel="L4555">the way. How do I know what injury you have done my horses. See! Give</li>
<li class="L4556" rel="L4556">him that.”</li>
<li class="L4557" rel="L4557"></li>
<li class="L4558" rel="L4558">He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads</li>
<li class="L4559" rel="L4559">craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell. The</li>
<li class="L4560" rel="L4560">tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry, “Dead!”</li>
<li class="L4561" rel="L4561"></li>
<li class="L4562" rel="L4562">He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man, for whom the rest</li>
<li class="L4563" rel="L4563">made way. On seeing him, the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder,</li>
<li class="L4564" rel="L4564">sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some women were</li>
<li class="L4565" rel="L4565">stooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently about it. They</li>
<li class="L4566" rel="L4566">were as silent, however, as the men.</li>
<li class="L4567" rel="L4567"></li>
<li class="L4568" rel="L4568">“I know all, I know all,” said the last comer. “Be a brave man, my</li>
<li class="L4569" rel="L4569">Gaspard! It is better for the poor little plaything to die so, than to</li>
<li class="L4570" rel="L4570">live. It has died in a moment without pain. Could it have lived an hour</li>
<li class="L4571" rel="L4571">as happily?”</li>
<li class="L4572" rel="L4572"></li>
<li class="L4573" rel="L4573">“You are a philosopher, you there,” said the Marquis, smiling. “How do</li>
<li class="L4574" rel="L4574">they call you?”</li>
<li class="L4575" rel="L4575"></li>
<li class="L4576" rel="L4576">“They call me Defarge.”</li>
<li class="L4577" rel="L4577"></li>
<li class="L4578" rel="L4578">“Of what trade?”</li>
<li class="L4579" rel="L4579"></li>
<li class="L4580" rel="L4580">“Monsieur the Marquis, vendor of wine.”</li>
<li class="L4581" rel="L4581"></li>
<li class="L4582" rel="L4582">“Pick up that, philosopher and vendor of wine,” said the Marquis,</li>
<li class="L4583" rel="L4583">throwing him another gold coin, “and spend it as you will. The horses</li>
<li class="L4584" rel="L4584">there; are they right?”</li>
<li class="L4585" rel="L4585"></li>
<li class="L4586" rel="L4586">Without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time, Monsieur the</li>
<li class="L4587" rel="L4587">Marquis leaned back in his seat, and was just being driven away with the</li>
<li class="L4588" rel="L4588">air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing, and had</li>
<li class="L4589" rel="L4589">paid for it, and could afford to pay for it; when his ease was suddenly</li>
<li class="L4590" rel="L4590">disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage, and ringing on its floor.</li>
<li class="L4591" rel="L4591"></li>
<li class="L4592" rel="L4592">“Hold!” said Monsieur the Marquis. “Hold the horses! Who threw that?”</li>
<li class="L4593" rel="L4593"></li>
<li class="L4594" rel="L4594">He looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood, a</li>
<li class="L4595" rel="L4595">moment before; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on</li>
<li class="L4596" rel="L4596">the pavement in that spot, and the figure that stood beside him was the</li>
<li class="L4597" rel="L4597">figure of a dark stout woman, knitting.</li>
<li class="L4598" rel="L4598"></li>
<li class="L4599" rel="L4599">“You dogs!” said the Marquis, but smoothly, and with an unchanged front,</li>
<li class="L4600" rel="L4600">except as to the spots on his nose: “I would ride over any of you very</li>
<li class="L4601" rel="L4601">willingly, and exterminate you from the earth. If I knew which rascal</li>
<li class="L4602" rel="L4602">threw at the carriage, and if that brigand were sufficiently near it, he</li>
<li class="L4603" rel="L4603">should be crushed under the wheels.”</li>
<li class="L4604" rel="L4604"></li>
<li class="L4605" rel="L4605">So cowed was their condition, and so long and hard their experience of</li>
<li class="L4606" rel="L4606">what such a man could do to them, within the law and beyond it, that not</li>
<li class="L4607" rel="L4607">a voice, or a hand, or even an eye was raised. Among the men, not one.</li>
<li class="L4608" rel="L4608">But the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily, and looked the</li>
<li class="L4609" rel="L4609">Marquis in the face. It was not for his dignity to notice it; his</li>
<li class="L4610" rel="L4610">contemptuous eyes passed over her, and over all the other rats; and he</li>
<li class="L4611" rel="L4611">leaned back in his seat again, and gave the word “Go on!”</li>
<li class="L4612" rel="L4612"></li>
<li class="L4613" rel="L4613">He was driven on, and other carriages came whirling by in quick</li>
<li class="L4614" rel="L4614">succession; the Minister, the State-Projector, the Farmer-General, the</li>
<li class="L4615" rel="L4615">Doctor, the Lawyer, the Ecclesiastic, the Grand Opera, the Comedy, the</li>
<li class="L4616" rel="L4616">whole Fancy Ball in a bright continuous flow, came whirling by. The rats</li>
<li class="L4617" rel="L4617">had crept out of their holes to look on, and they remained looking</li>
<li class="L4618" rel="L4618">on for hours; soldiers and police often passing between them and the</li>
<li class="L4619" rel="L4619">spectacle, and making a barrier behind which they slunk, and through</li>
<li class="L4620" rel="L4620">which they peeped. The father had long ago taken up his bundle and</li>
<li class="L4621" rel="L4621">bidden himself away with it, when the women who had tended the bundle</li>
<li class="L4622" rel="L4622">while it lay on the base of the fountain, sat there watching the running</li>
<li class="L4623" rel="L4623">of the water and the rolling of the Fancy Ball--when the one woman who</li>
<li class="L4624" rel="L4624">had stood conspicuous, knitting, still knitted on with the steadfastness</li>
<li class="L4625" rel="L4625">of Fate. The water of the fountain ran, the swift river ran, the day ran</li>
<li class="L4626" rel="L4626">into evening, so much life in the city ran into death according to rule,</li>
<li class="L4627" rel="L4627">time and tide waited for no man, the rats were sleeping close together</li>
<li class="L4628" rel="L4628">in their dark holes again, the Fancy Ball was lighted up at supper, all</li>
<li class="L4629" rel="L4629">things ran their course.</li>
<li class="L4630" rel="L4630"></li>
<li class="L4631" rel="L4631"></li>
<li class="L4632" rel="L4632"></li>
<li class="L4633" rel="L4633"></li>
<li class="L4634" rel="L4634">VIII. Monseigneur in the Country</li>
<li class="L4635" rel="L4635"></li>
<li class="L4636" rel="L4636"></li>
<li class="L4637" rel="L4637">A beautiful landscape, with the corn bright in it, but not abundant.</li>
<li class="L4638" rel="L4638">Patches of poor rye where corn should have been, patches of poor peas</li>
<li class="L4639" rel="L4639">and beans, patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat. On</li>
<li class="L4640" rel="L4640">inanimate nature, as on the men and women who cultivated it, a prevalent</li>
<li class="L4641" rel="L4641">tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly--a dejected</li>
<li class="L4642" rel="L4642">disposition to give up, and wither away.</li>
<li class="L4643" rel="L4643"></li>
<li class="L4644" rel="L4644">Monsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage (which might have been</li>
<li class="L4645" rel="L4645">lighter), conducted by four post-horses and two postilions, fagged up</li>
<li class="L4646" rel="L4646">a steep hill. A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis was</li>
<li class="L4647" rel="L4647">no impeachment of his high breeding; it was not from within; it was</li>
<li class="L4648" rel="L4648">occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control--the setting</li>
<li class="L4649" rel="L4649">sun.</li>
<li class="L4650" rel="L4650"></li>
<li class="L4651" rel="L4651">The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it</li>
<li class="L4652" rel="L4652">gained the hill-top, that its occupant was steeped in crimson. “It will</li>
<li class="L4653" rel="L4653">die out,” said Monsieur the Marquis, glancing at his hands, “directly.”</li>
<li class="L4654" rel="L4654"></li>
<li class="L4655" rel="L4655">In effect, the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment. When the</li>
<li class="L4656" rel="L4656">heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel, and the carriage slid down</li>
<li class="L4657" rel="L4657">hill, with a cinderous smell, in a cloud of dust, the red glow departed</li>
<li class="L4658" rel="L4658">quickly; the sun and the Marquis going down together, there was no glow</li>
<li class="L4659" rel="L4659">left when the drag was taken off.</li>
<li class="L4660" rel="L4660"></li>
<li class="L4661" rel="L4661">But, there remained a broken country, bold and open, a little village</li>
<li class="L4662" rel="L4662">at the bottom of the hill, a broad sweep and rise beyond it, a</li>
<li class="L4663" rel="L4663">church-tower, a windmill, a forest for the chase, and a crag with a</li>
<li class="L4664" rel="L4664">fortress on it used as a prison. Round upon all these darkening objects</li>
<li class="L4665" rel="L4665">as the night drew on, the Marquis looked, with the air of one who was</li>
<li class="L4666" rel="L4666">coming near home.</li>
<li class="L4667" rel="L4667"></li>
<li class="L4668" rel="L4668">The village had its one poor street, with its poor brewery, poor</li>
<li class="L4669" rel="L4669">tannery, poor tavern, poor stable-yard for relays of post-horses, poor</li>
<li class="L4670" rel="L4670">fountain, all usual poor appointments. It had its poor people too. All</li>
<li class="L4671" rel="L4671">its people were poor, and many of them were sitting at their doors,</li>
<li class="L4672" rel="L4672">shredding spare onions and the like for supper, while many were at the</li>
<li class="L4673" rel="L4673">fountain, washing leaves, and grasses, and any such small yieldings of</li>
<li class="L4674" rel="L4674">the earth that could be eaten. Expressive signs of what made them poor,</li>
<li class="L4675" rel="L4675">were not wanting; the tax for the state, the tax for the church, the tax</li>
<li class="L4676" rel="L4676">for the lord, tax local and tax general, were to be paid here and to be</li>
<li class="L4677" rel="L4677">paid there, according to solemn inscription in the little village, until</li>
<li class="L4678" rel="L4678">the wonder was, that there was any village left unswallowed.</li>
<li class="L4679" rel="L4679"></li>
<li class="L4680" rel="L4680">Few children were to be seen, and no dogs. As to the men and women,</li>
<li class="L4681" rel="L4681">their choice on earth was stated in the prospect--Life on the lowest</li>
<li class="L4682" rel="L4682">terms that could sustain it, down in the little village under the mill;</li>
<li class="L4683" rel="L4683">or captivity and Death in the dominant prison on the crag.</li>
<li class="L4684" rel="L4684"></li>
<li class="L4685" rel="L4685">Heralded by a courier in advance, and by the cracking of his postilions&#39;</li>
<li class="L4686" rel="L4686">whips, which twined snake-like about their heads in the evening air, as</li>
<li class="L4687" rel="L4687">if he came attended by the Furies, Monsieur the Marquis drew up in</li>
<li class="L4688" rel="L4688">his travelling carriage at the posting-house gate. It was hard by the</li>
<li class="L4689" rel="L4689">fountain, and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him.</li>
<li class="L4690" rel="L4690">He looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow</li>
<li class="L4691" rel="L4691">sure filing down of misery-worn face and figure, that was to make the</li>
<li class="L4692" rel="L4692">meagreness of Frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the</li>
<li class="L4693" rel="L4693">truth through the best part of a hundred years.</li>
<li class="L4694" rel="L4694"></li>
<li class="L4695" rel="L4695">Monsieur the Marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that</li>
<li class="L4696" rel="L4696">drooped before him, as the like of himself had drooped before</li>
<li class="L4697" rel="L4697">Monseigneur of the Court--only the difference was, that these faces</li>
<li class="L4698" rel="L4698">drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate--when a grizzled mender</li>
<li class="L4699" rel="L4699">of the roads joined the group.</li>
<li class="L4700" rel="L4700"></li>
<li class="L4701" rel="L4701">“Bring me hither that fellow!” said the Marquis to the courier.</li>
<li class="L4702" rel="L4702"></li>
<li class="L4703" rel="L4703">The fellow was brought, cap in hand, and the other fellows closed round</li>
<li class="L4704" rel="L4704">to look and listen, in the manner of the people at the Paris fountain.</li>
<li class="L4705" rel="L4705"></li>
<li class="L4706" rel="L4706">“I passed you on the road?”</li>
<li class="L4707" rel="L4707"></li>
<li class="L4708" rel="L4708">“Monseigneur, it is true. I had the honour of being passed on the road.”</li>
<li class="L4709" rel="L4709"></li>
<li class="L4710" rel="L4710">“Coming up the hill, and at the top of the hill, both?”</li>
<li class="L4711" rel="L4711"></li>
<li class="L4712" rel="L4712">“Monseigneur, it is true.”</li>
<li class="L4713" rel="L4713"></li>
<li class="L4714" rel="L4714">“What did you look at, so fixedly?”</li>
<li class="L4715" rel="L4715"></li>
<li class="L4716" rel="L4716">“Monseigneur, I looked at the man.”</li>
<li class="L4717" rel="L4717"></li>
<li class="L4718" rel="L4718">He stooped a little, and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the</li>
<li class="L4719" rel="L4719">carriage. All his fellows stooped to look under the carriage.</li>
<li class="L4720" rel="L4720"></li>
<li class="L4721" rel="L4721">“What man, pig? And why look there?”</li>
<li class="L4722" rel="L4722"></li>
<li class="L4723" rel="L4723">“Pardon, Monseigneur; he swung by the chain of the shoe--the drag.”</li>
<li class="L4724" rel="L4724"></li>
<li class="L4725" rel="L4725">“Who?” demanded the traveller.</li>
<li class="L4726" rel="L4726"></li>
<li class="L4727" rel="L4727">“Monseigneur, the man.”</li>
<li class="L4728" rel="L4728"></li>
<li class="L4729" rel="L4729">“May the Devil carry away these idiots! How do you call the man? You</li>
<li class="L4730" rel="L4730">know all the men of this part of the country. Who was he?”</li>
<li class="L4731" rel="L4731"></li>
<li class="L4732" rel="L4732">“Your clemency, Monseigneur! He was not of this part of the country. Of</li>
<li class="L4733" rel="L4733">all the days of my life, I never saw him.”</li>
<li class="L4734" rel="L4734"></li>
<li class="L4735" rel="L4735">“Swinging by the chain? To be suffocated?”</li>
<li class="L4736" rel="L4736"></li>
<li class="L4737" rel="L4737">“With your gracious permission, that was the wonder of it, Monseigneur.</li>
<li class="L4738" rel="L4738">His head hanging over--like this!”</li>
<li class="L4739" rel="L4739"></li>
<li class="L4740" rel="L4740">He turned himself sideways to the carriage, and leaned back, with his</li>
<li class="L4741" rel="L4741">face thrown up to the sky, and his head hanging down; then recovered</li>
<li class="L4742" rel="L4742">himself, fumbled with his cap, and made a bow.</li>
<li class="L4743" rel="L4743"></li>
<li class="L4744" rel="L4744">“What was he like?”</li>
<li class="L4745" rel="L4745"></li>
<li class="L4746" rel="L4746">“Monseigneur, he was whiter than the miller. All covered with dust,</li>
<li class="L4747" rel="L4747">white as a spectre, tall as a spectre!”</li>
<li class="L4748" rel="L4748"></li>
<li class="L4749" rel="L4749">The picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd; but all</li>
<li class="L4750" rel="L4750">eyes, without comparing notes with other eyes, looked at Monsieur</li>
<li class="L4751" rel="L4751">the Marquis. Perhaps, to observe whether he had any spectre on his</li>
<li class="L4752" rel="L4752">conscience.</li>
<li class="L4753" rel="L4753"></li>
<li class="L4754" rel="L4754">“Truly, you did well,” said the Marquis, felicitously sensible that such</li>
<li class="L4755" rel="L4755">vermin were not to ruffle him, “to see a thief accompanying my carriage,</li>
<li class="L4756" rel="L4756">and not open that great mouth of yours. Bah! Put him aside, Monsieur</li>
<li class="L4757" rel="L4757">Gabelle!”</li>
<li class="L4758" rel="L4758"></li>
<li class="L4759" rel="L4759">Monsieur Gabelle was the Postmaster, and some other taxing functionary</li>
<li class="L4760" rel="L4760">united; he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at this</li>
<li class="L4761" rel="L4761">examination, and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm in an</li>
<li class="L4762" rel="L4762">official manner.</li>
<li class="L4763" rel="L4763"></li>
<li class="L4764" rel="L4764">“Bah! Go aside!” said Monsieur Gabelle.</li>
<li class="L4765" rel="L4765"></li>
<li class="L4766" rel="L4766">“Lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village</li>
<li class="L4767" rel="L4767">to-night, and be sure that his business is honest, Gabelle.”</li>
<li class="L4768" rel="L4768"></li>
<li class="L4769" rel="L4769">“Monseigneur, I am flattered to devote myself to your orders.”</li>
<li class="L4770" rel="L4770"></li>
<li class="L4771" rel="L4771">“Did he run away, fellow?--where is that Accursed?”</li>
<li class="L4772" rel="L4772"></li>
<li class="L4773" rel="L4773">The accursed was already under the carriage with some half-dozen</li>
<li class="L4774" rel="L4774">particular friends, pointing out the chain with his blue cap. Some</li>
<li class="L4775" rel="L4775">half-dozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out, and</li>
<li class="L4776" rel="L4776">presented him breathless to Monsieur the Marquis.</li>
<li class="L4777" rel="L4777"></li>
<li class="L4778" rel="L4778">“Did the man run away, Dolt, when we stopped for the drag?”</li>
<li class="L4779" rel="L4779"></li>
<li class="L4780" rel="L4780">“Monseigneur, he precipitated himself over the hill-side, head first, as</li>
<li class="L4781" rel="L4781">a person plunges into the river.”</li>
<li class="L4782" rel="L4782"></li>
<li class="L4783" rel="L4783">“See to it, Gabelle. Go on!”</li>
<li class="L4784" rel="L4784"></li>
<li class="L4785" rel="L4785">The half-dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the</li>
<li class="L4786" rel="L4786">wheels, like sheep; the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky</li>
<li class="L4787" rel="L4787">to save their skins and bones; they had very little else to save, or</li>
<li class="L4788" rel="L4788">they might not have been so fortunate.</li>
<li class="L4789" rel="L4789"></li>
<li class="L4790" rel="L4790">The burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the</li>
<li class="L4791" rel="L4791">rise beyond, was soon checked by the steepness of the hill. Gradually,</li>
<li class="L4792" rel="L4792">it subsided to a foot pace, swinging and lumbering upward among the many</li>
<li class="L4793" rel="L4793">sweet scents of a summer night. The postilions, with a thousand gossamer</li>
<li class="L4794" rel="L4794">gnats circling about them in lieu of the Furies, quietly mended the</li>
<li class="L4795" rel="L4795">points to the lashes of their whips; the valet walked by the horses; the</li>
<li class="L4796" rel="L4796">courier was audible, trotting on ahead into the dull distance.</li>
<li class="L4797" rel="L4797"></li>
<li class="L4798" rel="L4798">At the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial-ground,</li>
<li class="L4799" rel="L4799">with a Cross and a new large figure of Our Saviour on it; it was a poor</li>
<li class="L4800" rel="L4800">figure in wood, done by some inexperienced rustic carver, but he had</li>
<li class="L4801" rel="L4801">studied the figure from the life--his own life, maybe--for it was</li>
<li class="L4802" rel="L4802">dreadfully spare and thin.</li>
<li class="L4803" rel="L4803"></li>
<li class="L4804" rel="L4804">To this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been</li>
<li class="L4805" rel="L4805">growing worse, and was not at its worst, a woman was kneeling. She</li>
<li class="L4806" rel="L4806">turned her head as the carriage came up to her, rose quickly, and</li>
<li class="L4807" rel="L4807">presented herself at the carriage-door.</li>
<li class="L4808" rel="L4808"></li>
<li class="L4809" rel="L4809">“It is you, Monseigneur! Monseigneur, a petition.”</li>
<li class="L4810" rel="L4810"></li>
<li class="L4811" rel="L4811">With an exclamation of impatience, but with his unchangeable face,</li>
<li class="L4812" rel="L4812">Monseigneur looked out.</li>
<li class="L4813" rel="L4813"></li>
<li class="L4814" rel="L4814">“How, then! What is it? Always petitions!”</li>
<li class="L4815" rel="L4815"></li>
<li class="L4816" rel="L4816">“Monseigneur. For the love of the great God! My husband, the forester.”</li>
<li class="L4817" rel="L4817"></li>
<li class="L4818" rel="L4818">“What of your husband, the forester? Always the same with you people. He</li>
<li class="L4819" rel="L4819">cannot pay something?”</li>
<li class="L4820" rel="L4820"></li>
<li class="L4821" rel="L4821">“He has paid all, Monseigneur. He is dead.”</li>
<li class="L4822" rel="L4822"></li>
<li class="L4823" rel="L4823">“Well! He is quiet. Can I restore him to you?”</li>
<li class="L4824" rel="L4824"></li>
<li class="L4825" rel="L4825">“Alas, no, Monseigneur! But he lies yonder, under a little heap of poor</li>
<li class="L4826" rel="L4826">grass.”</li>
<li class="L4827" rel="L4827"></li>
<li class="L4828" rel="L4828">“Well?”</li>
<li class="L4829" rel="L4829"></li>
<li class="L4830" rel="L4830">“Monseigneur, there are so many little heaps of poor grass?”</li>
<li class="L4831" rel="L4831"></li>
<li class="L4832" rel="L4832">“Again, well?”</li>
<li class="L4833" rel="L4833"></li>
<li class="L4834" rel="L4834">She looked an old woman, but was young. Her manner was one of passionate</li>
<li class="L4835" rel="L4835">grief; by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together</li>
<li class="L4836" rel="L4836">with wild energy, and laid one of them on the carriage-door--tenderly,</li>
<li class="L4837" rel="L4837">caressingly, as if it had been a human breast, and could be expected to</li>
<li class="L4838" rel="L4838">feel the appealing touch.</li>
<li class="L4839" rel="L4839"></li>
<li class="L4840" rel="L4840">“Monseigneur, hear me! Monseigneur, hear my petition! My husband died of</li>
<li class="L4841" rel="L4841">want; so many die of want; so many more will die of want.”</li>
<li class="L4842" rel="L4842"></li>
<li class="L4843" rel="L4843">“Again, well? Can I feed them?”</li>
<li class="L4844" rel="L4844"></li>
<li class="L4845" rel="L4845">“Monseigneur, the good God knows; but I don&#39;t ask it. My petition is,</li>
<li class="L4846" rel="L4846">that a morsel of stone or wood, with my husband&#39;s name, may be placed</li>
<li class="L4847" rel="L4847">over him to show where he lies. Otherwise, the place will be quickly</li>
<li class="L4848" rel="L4848">forgotten, it will never be found when I am dead of the same malady, I</li>
<li class="L4849" rel="L4849">shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass. Monseigneur, they</li>
<li class="L4850" rel="L4850">are so many, they increase so fast, there is so much want. Monseigneur!</li>
<li class="L4851" rel="L4851">Monseigneur!”</li>
<li class="L4852" rel="L4852"></li>
<li class="L4853" rel="L4853">The valet had put her away from the door, the carriage had broken into</li>
<li class="L4854" rel="L4854">a brisk trot, the postilions had quickened the pace, she was left far</li>
<li class="L4855" rel="L4855">behind, and Monseigneur, again escorted by the Furies, was rapidly</li>
<li class="L4856" rel="L4856">diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and</li>
<li class="L4857" rel="L4857">his chateau.</li>
<li class="L4858" rel="L4858"></li>
<li class="L4859" rel="L4859">The sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him, and rose, as</li>
<li class="L4860" rel="L4860">the rain falls, impartially, on the dusty, ragged, and toil-worn group</li>
<li class="L4861" rel="L4861">at the fountain not far away; to whom the mender of roads, with the aid</li>
<li class="L4862" rel="L4862">of the blue cap without which he was nothing, still enlarged upon his</li>
<li class="L4863" rel="L4863">man like a spectre, as long as they could bear it. By degrees, as they</li>
<li class="L4864" rel="L4864">could bear no more, they dropped off one by one, and lights twinkled</li>
<li class="L4865" rel="L4865">in little casements; which lights, as the casements darkened, and more</li>
<li class="L4866" rel="L4866">stars came out, seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having</li>
<li class="L4867" rel="L4867">been extinguished.</li>
<li class="L4868" rel="L4868"></li>
<li class="L4869" rel="L4869">The shadow of a large high-roofed house, and of many over-hanging trees,</li>
<li class="L4870" rel="L4870">was upon Monsieur the Marquis by that time; and the shadow was exchanged</li>
<li class="L4871" rel="L4871">for the light of a flambeau, as his carriage stopped, and the great door</li>
<li class="L4872" rel="L4872">of his chateau was opened to him.</li>
<li class="L4873" rel="L4873"></li>
<li class="L4874" rel="L4874">“Monsieur Charles, whom I expect; is he arrived from England?”</li>
<li class="L4875" rel="L4875"></li>
<li class="L4876" rel="L4876">“Monseigneur, not yet.”</li>
<li class="L4877" rel="L4877"></li>
<li class="L4878" rel="L4878"></li>
<li class="L4879" rel="L4879"></li>
<li class="L4880" rel="L4880"></li>
<li class="L4881" rel="L4881">IX. The Gorgon&#39;s Head</li>
<li class="L4882" rel="L4882"></li>
<li class="L4883" rel="L4883"></li>
<li class="L4884" rel="L4884">It was a heavy mass of building, that chateau of Monsieur the Marquis,</li>
<li class="L4885" rel="L4885">with a large stone courtyard before it, and two stone sweeps of</li>
<li class="L4886" rel="L4886">staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door. A stony</li>
<li class="L4887" rel="L4887">business altogether, with heavy stone balustrades, and stone urns, and</li>
<li class="L4888" rel="L4888">stone flowers, and stone faces of men, and stone heads of lions, in</li>
<li class="L4889" rel="L4889">all directions. As if the Gorgon&#39;s head had surveyed it, when it was</li>
<li class="L4890" rel="L4890">finished, two centuries ago.</li>
<li class="L4891" rel="L4891"></li>
<li class="L4892" rel="L4892">Up the broad flight of shallow steps, Monsieur the Marquis, flambeau</li>
<li class="L4893" rel="L4893">preceded, went from his carriage, sufficiently disturbing the darkness</li>
<li class="L4894" rel="L4894">to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile</li>
<li class="L4895" rel="L4895">of stable building away among the trees. All else was so quiet, that the</li>
<li class="L4896" rel="L4896">flambeau carried up the steps, and the other flambeau held at the great</li>
<li class="L4897" rel="L4897">door, burnt as if they were in a close room of state, instead of being</li>
<li class="L4898" rel="L4898">in the open night-air. Other sound than the owl&#39;s voice there was none,</li>
<li class="L4899" rel="L4899">save the falling of a fountain into its stone basin; for, it was one of</li>
<li class="L4900" rel="L4900">those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together, and then</li>
<li class="L4901" rel="L4901">heave a long low sigh, and hold their breath again.</li>
<li class="L4902" rel="L4902"></li>
<li class="L4903" rel="L4903">The great door clanged behind him, and Monsieur the Marquis crossed a</li>
<li class="L4904" rel="L4904">hall grim with certain old boar-spears, swords, and knives of the chase;</li>
<li class="L4905" rel="L4905">grimmer with certain heavy riding-rods and riding-whips, of which many a</li>
<li class="L4906" rel="L4906">peasant, gone to his benefactor Death, had felt the weight when his lord</li>
<li class="L4907" rel="L4907">was angry.</li>
<li class="L4908" rel="L4908"></li>
<li class="L4909" rel="L4909">Avoiding the larger rooms, which were dark and made fast for the night,</li>
<li class="L4910" rel="L4910">Monsieur the Marquis, with his flambeau-bearer going on before, went up</li>
<li class="L4911" rel="L4911">the staircase to a door in a corridor. This thrown open, admitted him</li>
<li class="L4912" rel="L4912">to his own private apartment of three rooms: his bed-chamber and two</li>
<li class="L4913" rel="L4913">others. High vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors, great dogs upon</li>
<li class="L4914" rel="L4914">the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time, and all luxuries</li>
<li class="L4915" rel="L4915">befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country.</li>
<li class="L4916" rel="L4916">The fashion of the last Louis but one, of the line that was never to</li>
<li class="L4917" rel="L4917">break--the fourteenth Louis--was conspicuous in their rich furniture;</li>
<li class="L4918" rel="L4918">but, it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old</li>
<li class="L4919" rel="L4919">pages in the history of France.</li>
<li class="L4920" rel="L4920"></li>
<li class="L4921" rel="L4921">A supper-table was laid for two, in the third of the rooms; a round</li>
<li class="L4922" rel="L4922">room, in one of the chateau&#39;s four extinguisher-topped towers. A small</li>
<li class="L4923" rel="L4923">lofty room, with its window wide open, and the wooden jalousie-blinds</li>
<li class="L4924" rel="L4924">closed, so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of</li>
<li class="L4925" rel="L4925">black, alternating with their broad lines of stone colour.</li>
<li class="L4926" rel="L4926"></li>
<li class="L4927" rel="L4927">“My nephew,” said the Marquis, glancing at the supper preparation; “they</li>
<li class="L4928" rel="L4928">said he was not arrived.”</li>
<li class="L4929" rel="L4929"></li>
<li class="L4930" rel="L4930">Nor was he; but, he had been expected with Monseigneur.</li>
<li class="L4931" rel="L4931"></li>
<li class="L4932" rel="L4932">“Ah! It is not probable he will arrive to-night; nevertheless, leave the</li>
<li class="L4933" rel="L4933">table as it is. I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour.”</li>
<li class="L4934" rel="L4934"></li>
<li class="L4935" rel="L4935">In a quarter of an hour Monseigneur was ready, and sat down alone to his</li>
<li class="L4936" rel="L4936">sumptuous and choice supper. His chair was opposite to the window, and</li>
<li class="L4937" rel="L4937">he had taken his soup, and was raising his glass of Bordeaux to his</li>
<li class="L4938" rel="L4938">lips, when he put it down.</li>
<li class="L4939" rel="L4939"></li>
<li class="L4940" rel="L4940">“What is that?” he calmly asked, looking with attention at the</li>
<li class="L4941" rel="L4941">horizontal lines of black and stone colour.</li>
<li class="L4942" rel="L4942"></li>
<li class="L4943" rel="L4943">“Monseigneur? That?”</li>
<li class="L4944" rel="L4944"></li>
<li class="L4945" rel="L4945">“Outside the blinds. Open the blinds.”</li>
<li class="L4946" rel="L4946"></li>
<li class="L4947" rel="L4947">It was done.</li>
<li class="L4948" rel="L4948"></li>
<li class="L4949" rel="L4949">“Well?”</li>
<li class="L4950" rel="L4950"></li>
<li class="L4951" rel="L4951">“Monseigneur, it is nothing. The trees and the night are all that are</li>
<li class="L4952" rel="L4952">here.”</li>
<li class="L4953" rel="L4953"></li>
<li class="L4954" rel="L4954">The servant who spoke, had thrown the blinds wide, had looked out into</li>
<li class="L4955" rel="L4955">the vacant darkness, and stood with that blank behind him, looking round</li>
<li class="L4956" rel="L4956">for instructions.</li>
<li class="L4957" rel="L4957"></li>
<li class="L4958" rel="L4958">“Good,” said the imperturbable master. “Close them again.”</li>
<li class="L4959" rel="L4959"></li>
<li class="L4960" rel="L4960">That was done too, and the Marquis went on with his supper. He was</li>
<li class="L4961" rel="L4961">half way through it, when he again stopped with his glass in his hand,</li>
<li class="L4962" rel="L4962">hearing the sound of wheels. It came on briskly, and came up to the</li>
<li class="L4963" rel="L4963">front of the chateau.</li>
<li class="L4964" rel="L4964"></li>
<li class="L4965" rel="L4965">“Ask who is arrived.”</li>
<li class="L4966" rel="L4966"></li>
<li class="L4967" rel="L4967">It was the nephew of Monseigneur. He had been some few leagues behind</li>
<li class="L4968" rel="L4968">Monseigneur, early in the afternoon. He had diminished the distance</li>
<li class="L4969" rel="L4969">rapidly, but not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on the road.</li>
<li class="L4970" rel="L4970">He had heard of Monseigneur, at the posting-houses, as being before him.</li>
<li class="L4971" rel="L4971"></li>
<li class="L4972" rel="L4972">He was to be told (said Monseigneur) that supper awaited him then and</li>
<li class="L4973" rel="L4973">there, and that he was prayed to come to it. In a little while he came.</li>
<li class="L4974" rel="L4974">He had been known in England as Charles Darnay.</li>
<li class="L4975" rel="L4975"></li>
<li class="L4976" rel="L4976">Monseigneur received him in a courtly manner, but they did not shake</li>
<li class="L4977" rel="L4977">hands.</li>
<li class="L4978" rel="L4978"></li>
<li class="L4979" rel="L4979">“You left Paris yesterday, sir?” he said to Monseigneur, as he took his</li>
<li class="L4980" rel="L4980">seat at table.</li>
<li class="L4981" rel="L4981"></li>
<li class="L4982" rel="L4982">“Yesterday. And you?”</li>
<li class="L4983" rel="L4983"></li>
<li class="L4984" rel="L4984">“I come direct.”</li>
<li class="L4985" rel="L4985"></li>
<li class="L4986" rel="L4986">“From London?”</li>
<li class="L4987" rel="L4987"></li>
<li class="L4988" rel="L4988">“Yes.”</li>
<li class="L4989" rel="L4989"></li>
<li class="L4990" rel="L4990">“You have been a long time coming,” said the Marquis, with a smile.</li>
<li class="L4991" rel="L4991"></li>
<li class="L4992" rel="L4992">“On the contrary; I come direct.”</li>
<li class="L4993" rel="L4993"></li>
<li class="L4994" rel="L4994">“Pardon me! I mean, not a long time on the journey; a long time</li>
<li class="L4995" rel="L4995">intending the journey.”</li>
<li class="L4996" rel="L4996"></li>
<li class="L4997" rel="L4997">“I have been detained by”--the nephew stopped a moment in his</li>
<li class="L4998" rel="L4998">answer--“various business.”</li>
<li class="L4999" rel="L4999"></li>
<li class="L5000" rel="L5000">“Without doubt,” said the polished uncle.</li>
<li class="L5001" rel="L5001"></li>
<li class="L5002" rel="L5002">So long as a servant was present, no other words passed between them.</li>
<li class="L5003" rel="L5003">When coffee had been served and they were alone together, the nephew,</li>
<li class="L5004" rel="L5004">looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a</li>
<li class="L5005" rel="L5005">fine mask, opened a conversation.</li>
<li class="L5006" rel="L5006"></li>
<li class="L5007" rel="L5007">“I have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing the object that</li>
<li class="L5008" rel="L5008">took me away. It carried me into great and unexpected peril; but it is</li>
<li class="L5009" rel="L5009">a sacred object, and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have</li>
<li class="L5010" rel="L5010">sustained me.”</li>
<li class="L5011" rel="L5011"></li>
<li class="L5012" rel="L5012">“Not to death,” said the uncle; “it is not necessary to say, to death.”</li>
<li class="L5013" rel="L5013"></li>
<li class="L5014" rel="L5014">“I doubt, sir,” returned the nephew, “whether, if it had carried me to</li>
<li class="L5015" rel="L5015">the utmost brink of death, you would have cared to stop me there.”</li>
<li class="L5016" rel="L5016"></li>
<li class="L5017" rel="L5017">The deepened marks in the nose, and the lengthening of the fine straight</li>
<li class="L5018" rel="L5018">lines in the cruel face, looked ominous as to that; the uncle made a</li>
<li class="L5019" rel="L5019">graceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form of good</li>
<li class="L5020" rel="L5020">breeding that it was not reassuring.</li>
<li class="L5021" rel="L5021"></li>
<li class="L5022" rel="L5022">“Indeed, sir,” pursued the nephew, “for anything I know, you may have</li>
<li class="L5023" rel="L5023">expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious</li>
<li class="L5024" rel="L5024">circumstances that surrounded me.”</li>
<li class="L5025" rel="L5025"></li>
<li class="L5026" rel="L5026">“No, no, no,” said the uncle, pleasantly.</li>
<li class="L5027" rel="L5027"></li>
<li class="L5028" rel="L5028">“But, however that may be,” resumed the nephew, glancing at him with</li>
<li class="L5029" rel="L5029">deep distrust, “I know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means,</li>
<li class="L5030" rel="L5030">and would know no scruple as to means.”</li>
<li class="L5031" rel="L5031"></li>
<li class="L5032" rel="L5032">“My friend, I told you so,” said the uncle, with a fine pulsation in the</li>
<li class="L5033" rel="L5033">two marks. “Do me the favour to recall that I told you so, long ago.”</li>
<li class="L5034" rel="L5034"></li>
<li class="L5035" rel="L5035">“I recall it.”</li>
<li class="L5036" rel="L5036"></li>
<li class="L5037" rel="L5037">“Thank you,” said the Marquis--very sweetly indeed.</li>
<li class="L5038" rel="L5038"></li>
<li class="L5039" rel="L5039">His tone lingered in the air, almost like the tone of a musical</li>
<li class="L5040" rel="L5040">instrument.</li>
<li class="L5041" rel="L5041"></li>
<li class="L5042" rel="L5042">“In effect, sir,” pursued the nephew, “I believe it to be at once your</li>
<li class="L5043" rel="L5043">bad fortune, and my good fortune, that has kept me out of a prison in</li>
<li class="L5044" rel="L5044">France here.”</li>
<li class="L5045" rel="L5045"></li>
<li class="L5046" rel="L5046">“I do not quite understand,” returned the uncle, sipping his coffee.</li>
<li class="L5047" rel="L5047">“Dare I ask you to explain?”</li>
<li class="L5048" rel="L5048"></li>
<li class="L5049" rel="L5049">“I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court, and had not</li>
<li class="L5050" rel="L5050">been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet would</li>
<li class="L5051" rel="L5051">have sent me to some fortress indefinitely.”</li>
<li class="L5052" rel="L5052"></li>
<li class="L5053" rel="L5053">“It is possible,” said the uncle, with great calmness. “For the honour</li>
<li class="L5054" rel="L5054">of the family, I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent.</li>
<li class="L5055" rel="L5055">Pray excuse me!”</li>
<li class="L5056" rel="L5056"></li>
<li class="L5057" rel="L5057">“I perceive that, happily for me, the Reception of the day before</li>
<li class="L5058" rel="L5058">yesterday was, as usual, a cold one,” observed the nephew.</li>
<li class="L5059" rel="L5059"></li>
<li class="L5060" rel="L5060">“I would not say happily, my friend,” returned the uncle, with refined</li>
<li class="L5061" rel="L5061">politeness; “I would not be sure of that. A good opportunity for</li>
<li class="L5062" rel="L5062">consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence</li>
<li class="L5063" rel="L5063">your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for</li>
<li class="L5064" rel="L5064">yourself. But it is useless to discuss the question. I am, as you say,</li>
<li class="L5065" rel="L5065">at a disadvantage. These little instruments of correction, these gentle</li>
<li class="L5066" rel="L5066">aids to the power and honour of families, these slight favours that</li>
<li class="L5067" rel="L5067">might so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest</li>
<li class="L5068" rel="L5068">and importunity. They are sought by so many, and they are granted</li>
<li class="L5069" rel="L5069">(comparatively) to so few! It used not to be so, but France in all such</li>
<li class="L5070" rel="L5070">things is changed for the worse. Our not remote ancestors held the right</li>
<li class="L5071" rel="L5071">of life and death over the surrounding vulgar. From this room, many such</li>
<li class="L5072" rel="L5072">dogs have been taken out to be hanged; in the next room (my bedroom),</li>
<li class="L5073" rel="L5073">one fellow, to our knowledge, was poniarded on the spot for professing</li>
<li class="L5074" rel="L5074">some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter--_his_ daughter? We have</li>
<li class="L5075" rel="L5075">lost many privileges; a new philosophy has become the mode; and the</li>
<li class="L5076" rel="L5076">assertion of our station, in these days, might (I do not go so far as</li>
<li class="L5077" rel="L5077">to say would, but might) cause us real inconvenience. All very bad, very</li>
<li class="L5078" rel="L5078">bad!”</li>
<li class="L5079" rel="L5079"></li>
<li class="L5080" rel="L5080">The Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff, and shook his head;</li>
<li class="L5081" rel="L5081">as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still</li>
<li class="L5082" rel="L5082">containing himself, that great means of regeneration.</li>
<li class="L5083" rel="L5083"></li>
<li class="L5084" rel="L5084">“We have so asserted our station, both in the old time and in the modern</li>
<li class="L5085" rel="L5085">time also,” said the nephew, gloomily, “that I believe our name to be</li>
<li class="L5086" rel="L5086">more detested than any name in France.”</li>
<li class="L5087" rel="L5087"></li>
<li class="L5088" rel="L5088">“Let us hope so,” said the uncle. “Detestation of the high is the</li>
<li class="L5089" rel="L5089">involuntary homage of the low.”</li>
<li class="L5090" rel="L5090"></li>
<li class="L5091" rel="L5091">“There is not,” pursued the nephew, in his former tone, “a face I can</li>
<li class="L5092" rel="L5092">look at, in all this country round about us, which looks at me with any</li>
<li class="L5093" rel="L5093">deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery.”</li>
<li class="L5094" rel="L5094"></li>
<li class="L5095" rel="L5095">“A compliment,” said the Marquis, “to the grandeur of the family,</li>
<li class="L5096" rel="L5096">merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur.</li>
<li class="L5097" rel="L5097">Hah!” And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly</li>
<li class="L5098" rel="L5098">crossed his legs.</li>
<li class="L5099" rel="L5099"></li>
<li class="L5100" rel="L5100">But, when his nephew, leaning an elbow on the table, covered his eyes</li>
<li class="L5101" rel="L5101">thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand, the fine mask looked at</li>
<li class="L5102" rel="L5102">him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness,</li>
<li class="L5103" rel="L5103">and dislike, than was comportable with its wearer&#39;s assumption of</li>
<li class="L5104" rel="L5104">indifference.</li>
<li class="L5105" rel="L5105"></li>
<li class="L5106" rel="L5106">“Repression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of fear</li>
<li class="L5107" rel="L5107">and slavery, my friend,” observed the Marquis, “will keep the dogs</li>
<li class="L5108" rel="L5108">obedient to the whip, as long as this roof,” looking up to it, “shuts</li>
<li class="L5109" rel="L5109">out the sky.”</li>
<li class="L5110" rel="L5110"></li>
<li class="L5111" rel="L5111">That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed. If a picture of the</li>
<li class="L5112" rel="L5112">chateau as it was to be a very few years hence, and of fifty like it as</li>
<li class="L5113" rel="L5113">they too were to be a very few years hence, could have been shown to</li>
<li class="L5114" rel="L5114">him that night, he might have been at a loss to claim his own from</li>
<li class="L5115" rel="L5115">the ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked rains. As for the roof</li>
<li class="L5116" rel="L5116">he vaunted, he might have found _that_ shutting out the sky in a new</li>
<li class="L5117" rel="L5117">way--to wit, for ever, from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead</li>
<li class="L5118" rel="L5118">was fired, out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets.</li>
<li class="L5119" rel="L5119"></li>
<li class="L5120" rel="L5120">“Meanwhile,” said the Marquis, “I will preserve the honour and repose</li>
<li class="L5121" rel="L5121">of the family, if you will not. But you must be fatigued. Shall we</li>
<li class="L5122" rel="L5122">terminate our conference for the night?”</li>
<li class="L5123" rel="L5123"></li>
<li class="L5124" rel="L5124">“A moment more.”</li>
<li class="L5125" rel="L5125"></li>
<li class="L5126" rel="L5126">“An hour, if you please.”</li>
<li class="L5127" rel="L5127"></li>
<li class="L5128" rel="L5128">“Sir,” said the nephew, “we have done wrong, and are reaping the fruits</li>
<li class="L5129" rel="L5129">of wrong.”</li>
<li class="L5130" rel="L5130"></li>
<li class="L5131" rel="L5131">“_We_ have done wrong?” repeated the Marquis, with an inquiring smile,</li>
<li class="L5132" rel="L5132">and delicately pointing, first to his nephew, then to himself.</li>
<li class="L5133" rel="L5133"></li>
<li class="L5134" rel="L5134">“Our family; our honourable family, whose honour is of so much account</li>
<li class="L5135" rel="L5135">to both of us, in such different ways. Even in my father&#39;s time, we did</li>
<li class="L5136" rel="L5136">a world of wrong, injuring every human creature who came between us and</li>
<li class="L5137" rel="L5137">our pleasure, whatever it was. Why need I speak of my father&#39;s time,</li>
<li class="L5138" rel="L5138">when it is equally yours? Can I separate my father&#39;s twin-brother, joint</li>
<li class="L5139" rel="L5139">inheritor, and next successor, from himself?”</li>
<li class="L5140" rel="L5140"></li>
<li class="L5141" rel="L5141">“Death has done that!” said the Marquis.</li>
<li class="L5142" rel="L5142"></li>
<li class="L5143" rel="L5143">“And has left me,” answered the nephew, “bound to a system that is</li>
<li class="L5144" rel="L5144">frightful to me, responsible for it, but powerless in it; seeking to</li>
<li class="L5145" rel="L5145">execute the last request of my dear mother&#39;s lips, and obey the last</li>
<li class="L5146" rel="L5146">look of my dear mother&#39;s eyes, which implored me to have mercy and to</li>
<li class="L5147" rel="L5147">redress; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain.”</li>
<li class="L5148" rel="L5148"></li>
<li class="L5149" rel="L5149">“Seeking them from me, my nephew,” said the Marquis, touching him on the</li>
<li class="L5150" rel="L5150">breast with his forefinger--they were now standing by the hearth--“you</li>
<li class="L5151" rel="L5151">will for ever seek them in vain, be assured.”</li>
<li class="L5152" rel="L5152"></li>
<li class="L5153" rel="L5153">Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face, was</li>
<li class="L5154" rel="L5154">cruelly, craftily, and closely compressed, while he stood looking</li>
<li class="L5155" rel="L5155">quietly at his nephew, with his snuff-box in his hand. Once again he</li>
<li class="L5156" rel="L5156">touched him on the breast, as though his finger were the fine point of</li>
<li class="L5157" rel="L5157">a small sword, with which, in delicate finesse, he ran him through the</li>
<li class="L5158" rel="L5158">body, and said,</li>
<li class="L5159" rel="L5159"></li>
<li class="L5160" rel="L5160">“My friend, I will die, perpetuating the system under which I have</li>
<li class="L5161" rel="L5161">lived.”</li>
<li class="L5162" rel="L5162"></li>
<li class="L5163" rel="L5163">When he had said it, he took a culminating pinch of snuff, and put his</li>
<li class="L5164" rel="L5164">box in his pocket.</li>
<li class="L5165" rel="L5165"></li>
<li class="L5166" rel="L5166">“Better to be a rational creature,” he added then, after ringing a small</li>
<li class="L5167" rel="L5167">bell on the table, “and accept your natural destiny. But you are lost,</li>
<li class="L5168" rel="L5168">Monsieur Charles, I see.”</li>
<li class="L5169" rel="L5169"></li>
<li class="L5170" rel="L5170">“This property and France are lost to me,” said the nephew, sadly; “I</li>
<li class="L5171" rel="L5171">renounce them.”</li>
<li class="L5172" rel="L5172"></li>
<li class="L5173" rel="L5173">“Are they both yours to renounce? France may be, but is the property? It</li>
<li class="L5174" rel="L5174">is scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it yet?”</li>
<li class="L5175" rel="L5175"></li>
<li class="L5176" rel="L5176">“I had no intention, in the words I used, to claim it yet. If it passed</li>
<li class="L5177" rel="L5177">to me from you, to-morrow--”</li>
<li class="L5178" rel="L5178"></li>
<li class="L5179" rel="L5179">“Which I have the vanity to hope is not probable.”</li>
<li class="L5180" rel="L5180"></li>
<li class="L5181" rel="L5181">“--or twenty years hence--”</li>
<li class="L5182" rel="L5182"></li>
<li class="L5183" rel="L5183">“You do me too much honour,” said the Marquis; “still, I prefer that</li>
<li class="L5184" rel="L5184">supposition.”</li>
<li class="L5185" rel="L5185"></li>
<li class="L5186" rel="L5186">“--I would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere. It is little to</li>
<li class="L5187" rel="L5187">relinquish. What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin!”</li>
<li class="L5188" rel="L5188"></li>
<li class="L5189" rel="L5189">“Hah!” said the Marquis, glancing round the luxurious room.</li>
<li class="L5190" rel="L5190"></li>
<li class="L5191" rel="L5191">“To the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity,</li>
<li class="L5192" rel="L5192">under the sky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste,</li>
<li class="L5193" rel="L5193">mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness,</li>
<li class="L5194" rel="L5194">and suffering.”</li>
<li class="L5195" rel="L5195"></li>
<li class="L5196" rel="L5196">“Hah!” said the Marquis again, in a well-satisfied manner.</li>
<li class="L5197" rel="L5197"></li>
<li class="L5198" rel="L5198">“If it ever becomes mine, it shall be put into some hands better</li>
<li class="L5199" rel="L5199">qualified to free it slowly (if such a thing is possible) from the</li>
<li class="L5200" rel="L5200">weight that drags it down, so that the miserable people who cannot leave</li>
<li class="L5201" rel="L5201">it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance, may, in</li>
<li class="L5202" rel="L5202">another generation, suffer less; but it is not for me. There is a curse</li>
<li class="L5203" rel="L5203">on it, and on all this land.”</li>
<li class="L5204" rel="L5204"></li>
<li class="L5205" rel="L5205">“And you?” said the uncle. “Forgive my curiosity; do you, under your new</li>
<li class="L5206" rel="L5206">philosophy, graciously intend to live?”</li>
<li class="L5207" rel="L5207"></li>
<li class="L5208" rel="L5208">“I must do, to live, what others of my countrymen, even with nobility at</li>
<li class="L5209" rel="L5209">their backs, may have to do some day--work.”</li>
<li class="L5210" rel="L5210"></li>
<li class="L5211" rel="L5211">“In England, for example?”</li>
<li class="L5212" rel="L5212"></li>
<li class="L5213" rel="L5213">“Yes. The family honour, sir, is safe from me in this country. The</li>
<li class="L5214" rel="L5214">family name can suffer from me in no other, for I bear it in no other.”</li>
<li class="L5215" rel="L5215"></li>
<li class="L5216" rel="L5216">The ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to be</li>
<li class="L5217" rel="L5217">lighted. It now shone brightly, through the door of communication. The</li>
<li class="L5218" rel="L5218">Marquis looked that way, and listened for the retreating step of his</li>
<li class="L5219" rel="L5219">valet.</li>
<li class="L5220" rel="L5220"></li>
<li class="L5221" rel="L5221">“England is very attractive to you, seeing how indifferently you have</li>
<li class="L5222" rel="L5222">prospered there,” he observed then, turning his calm face to his nephew</li>
<li class="L5223" rel="L5223">with a smile.</li>
<li class="L5224" rel="L5224"></li>
<li class="L5225" rel="L5225">“I have already said, that for my prospering there, I am sensible I may</li>
<li class="L5226" rel="L5226">be indebted to you, sir. For the rest, it is my Refuge.”</li>
<li class="L5227" rel="L5227"></li>
<li class="L5228" rel="L5228">“They say, those boastful English, that it is the Refuge of many. You</li>
<li class="L5229" rel="L5229">know a compatriot who has found a Refuge there? A Doctor?”</li>
<li class="L5230" rel="L5230"></li>
<li class="L5231" rel="L5231">“Yes.”</li>
<li class="L5232" rel="L5232"></li>
<li class="L5233" rel="L5233">“With a daughter?”</li>
<li class="L5234" rel="L5234"></li>
<li class="L5235" rel="L5235">“Yes.”</li>
<li class="L5236" rel="L5236"></li>
<li class="L5237" rel="L5237">“Yes,” said the Marquis. “You are fatigued. Good night!”</li>
<li class="L5238" rel="L5238"></li>
<li class="L5239" rel="L5239">As he bent his head in his most courtly manner, there was a secrecy</li>
<li class="L5240" rel="L5240">in his smiling face, and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words,</li>
<li class="L5241" rel="L5241">which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly. At the same</li>
<li class="L5242" rel="L5242">time, the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes, and the thin</li>
<li class="L5243" rel="L5243">straight lips, and the markings in the nose, curved with a sarcasm that</li>
<li class="L5244" rel="L5244">looked handsomely diabolic.</li>
<li class="L5245" rel="L5245"></li>
<li class="L5246" rel="L5246">“Yes,” repeated the Marquis. “A Doctor with a daughter. Yes. So</li>
<li class="L5247" rel="L5247">commences the new philosophy! You are fatigued. Good night!”</li>
<li class="L5248" rel="L5248"></li>
<li class="L5249" rel="L5249">It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face</li>
<li class="L5250" rel="L5250">outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his. The nephew</li>
<li class="L5251" rel="L5251">looked at him, in vain, in passing on to the door.</li>
<li class="L5252" rel="L5252"></li>
<li class="L5253" rel="L5253">“Good night!” said the uncle. “I look to the pleasure of seeing you</li>
<li class="L5254" rel="L5254">again in the morning. Good repose! Light Monsieur my nephew to his</li>
<li class="L5255" rel="L5255">chamber there!--And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed, if you will,” he</li>
<li class="L5256" rel="L5256">added to himself, before he rang his little bell again, and summoned his</li>
<li class="L5257" rel="L5257">valet to his own bedroom.</li>
<li class="L5258" rel="L5258"></li>
<li class="L5259" rel="L5259">The valet come and gone, Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro in his</li>
<li class="L5260" rel="L5260">loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that hot still</li>
<li class="L5261" rel="L5261">night. Rustling about the room, his softly-slippered feet making no</li>
<li class="L5262" rel="L5262">noise on the floor, he moved like a refined tiger:--looked like some</li>
<li class="L5263" rel="L5263">enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort, in story, whose</li>
<li class="L5264" rel="L5264">periodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just</li>
<li class="L5265" rel="L5265">coming on.</li>
<li class="L5266" rel="L5266"></li>
<li class="L5267" rel="L5267">He moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom, looking again at the</li>
<li class="L5268" rel="L5268">scraps of the day&#39;s journey that came unbidden into his mind; the slow</li>
<li class="L5269" rel="L5269">toil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the mill, the</li>
<li class="L5270" rel="L5270">prison on the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants at</li>
<li class="L5271" rel="L5271">the fountain, and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the</li>
<li class="L5272" rel="L5272">chain under the carriage. That fountain suggested the Paris fountain,</li>
<li class="L5273" rel="L5273">the little bundle lying on the step, the women bending over it, and the</li>
<li class="L5274" rel="L5274">tall man with his arms up, crying, “Dead!”</li>
<li class="L5275" rel="L5275"></li>
<li class="L5276" rel="L5276">“I am cool now,” said Monsieur the Marquis, “and may go to bed.”</li>
<li class="L5277" rel="L5277"></li>
<li class="L5278" rel="L5278">So, leaving only one light burning on the large hearth, he let his thin</li>
<li class="L5279" rel="L5279">gauze curtains fall around him, and heard the night break its silence</li>
<li class="L5280" rel="L5280">with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep.</li>
<li class="L5281" rel="L5281"></li>
<li class="L5282" rel="L5282">The stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night</li>
<li class="L5283" rel="L5283">for three heavy hours; for three heavy hours, the horses in the stables</li>
<li class="L5284" rel="L5284">rattled at their racks, the dogs barked, and the owl made a noise with</li>
<li class="L5285" rel="L5285">very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to</li>
<li class="L5286" rel="L5286">the owl by men-poets. But it is the obstinate custom of such creatures</li>
<li class="L5287" rel="L5287">hardly ever to say what is set down for them.</li>
<li class="L5288" rel="L5288"></li>
<li class="L5289" rel="L5289">For three heavy hours, the stone faces of the chateau, lion and human,</li>
<li class="L5290" rel="L5290">stared blindly at the night. Dead darkness lay on all the landscape,</li>
<li class="L5291" rel="L5291">dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads.</li>
<li class="L5292" rel="L5292">The burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass</li>
<li class="L5293" rel="L5293">were undistinguishable from one another; the figure on the Cross might</li>
<li class="L5294" rel="L5294">have come down, for anything that could be seen of it. In the village,</li>
<li class="L5295" rel="L5295">taxers and taxed were fast asleep. Dreaming, perhaps, of banquets, as</li>
<li class="L5296" rel="L5296">the starved usually do, and of ease and rest, as the driven slave and</li>
<li class="L5297" rel="L5297">the yoked ox may, its lean inhabitants slept soundly, and were fed and</li>
<li class="L5298" rel="L5298">freed.</li>
<li class="L5299" rel="L5299"></li>
<li class="L5300" rel="L5300">The fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard, and the fountain</li>
<li class="L5301" rel="L5301">at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard--both melting away, like the</li>
<li class="L5302" rel="L5302">minutes that were falling from the spring of Time--through three dark</li>
<li class="L5303" rel="L5303">hours. Then, the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light,</li>
<li class="L5304" rel="L5304">and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened.</li>
<li class="L5305" rel="L5305"></li>
<li class="L5306" rel="L5306">Lighter and lighter, until at last the sun touched the tops of the still</li>
<li class="L5307" rel="L5307">trees, and poured its radiance over the hill. In the glow, the water</li>
<li class="L5308" rel="L5308">of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood, and the stone faces</li>
<li class="L5309" rel="L5309">crimsoned. The carol of the birds was loud and high, and, on the</li>
<li class="L5310" rel="L5310">weather-beaten sill of the great window of the bed-chamber of Monsieur</li>
<li class="L5311" rel="L5311">the Marquis, one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might.</li>
<li class="L5312" rel="L5312">At this, the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed, and, with open</li>
<li class="L5313" rel="L5313">mouth and dropped under-jaw, looked awe-stricken.</li>
<li class="L5314" rel="L5314"></li>
<li class="L5315" rel="L5315">Now, the sun was full up, and movement began in the village. Casement</li>
<li class="L5316" rel="L5316">windows opened, crazy doors were unbarred, and people came forth</li>
<li class="L5317" rel="L5317">shivering--chilled, as yet, by the new sweet air. Then began the rarely</li>
<li class="L5318" rel="L5318">lightened toil of the day among the village population. Some, to the</li>
<li class="L5319" rel="L5319">fountain; some, to the fields; men and women here, to dig and delve; men</li>
<li class="L5320" rel="L5320">and women there, to see to the poor live stock, and lead the bony cows</li>
<li class="L5321" rel="L5321">out, to such pasture as could be found by the roadside. In the church</li>
<li class="L5322" rel="L5322">and at the Cross, a kneeling figure or two; attendant on the latter</li>
<li class="L5323" rel="L5323">prayers, the led cow, trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its</li>
<li class="L5324" rel="L5324">foot.</li>
<li class="L5325" rel="L5325"></li>
<li class="L5326" rel="L5326">The chateau awoke later, as became its quality, but awoke gradually and</li>
<li class="L5327" rel="L5327">surely. First, the lonely boar-spears and knives of the chase had been</li>
<li class="L5328" rel="L5328">reddened as of old; then, had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine;</li>
<li class="L5329" rel="L5329">now, doors and windows were thrown open, horses in their stables looked</li>
<li class="L5330" rel="L5330">round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at</li>
<li class="L5331" rel="L5331">doorways, leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows, dogs</li>
<li class="L5332" rel="L5332">pulled hard at their chains, and reared impatient to be loosed.</li>
<li class="L5333" rel="L5333"></li>
<li class="L5334" rel="L5334">All these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life, and the</li>
<li class="L5335" rel="L5335">return of morning. Surely, not so the ringing of the great bell of the</li>
<li class="L5336" rel="L5336">chateau, nor the running up and down the stairs; nor the hurried</li>
<li class="L5337" rel="L5337">figures on the terrace; nor the booting and tramping here and there and</li>
<li class="L5338" rel="L5338">everywhere, nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away?</li>
<li class="L5339" rel="L5339"></li>
<li class="L5340" rel="L5340">What winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads, already</li>
<li class="L5341" rel="L5341">at work on the hill-top beyond the village, with his day&#39;s dinner (not</li>
<li class="L5342" rel="L5342">much to carry) lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow&#39;s while to</li>
<li class="L5343" rel="L5343">peck at, on a heap of stones? Had the birds, carrying some grains of it</li>
<li class="L5344" rel="L5344">to a distance, dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds? Whether or</li>
<li class="L5345" rel="L5345">no, the mender of roads ran, on the sultry morning, as if for his life,</li>
<li class="L5346" rel="L5346">down the hill, knee-high in dust, and never stopped till he got to the</li>
<li class="L5347" rel="L5347">fountain.</li>
<li class="L5348" rel="L5348"></li>
<li class="L5349" rel="L5349">All the people of the village were at the fountain, standing about</li>
<li class="L5350" rel="L5350">in their depressed manner, and whispering low, but showing no other</li>
<li class="L5351" rel="L5351">emotions than grim curiosity and surprise. The led cows, hastily brought</li>
<li class="L5352" rel="L5352">in and tethered to anything that would hold them, were looking stupidly</li>
<li class="L5353" rel="L5353">on, or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their</li>
<li class="L5354" rel="L5354">trouble, which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter. Some of</li>
<li class="L5355" rel="L5355">the people of the chateau, and some of those of the posting-house, and</li>
<li class="L5356" rel="L5356">all the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded</li>
<li class="L5357" rel="L5357">on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was</li>
<li class="L5358" rel="L5358">highly fraught with nothing. Already, the mender of roads had penetrated</li>
<li class="L5359" rel="L5359">into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting</li>
<li class="L5360" rel="L5360">himself in the breast with his blue cap. What did all this portend,</li>
<li class="L5361" rel="L5361">and what portended the swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind</li>
<li class="L5362" rel="L5362">a servant on horseback, and the conveying away of the said Gabelle</li>
<li class="L5363" rel="L5363">(double-laden though the horse was), at a gallop, like a new version of</li>
<li class="L5364" rel="L5364">the German ballad of Leonora?</li>
<li class="L5365" rel="L5365"></li>
<li class="L5366" rel="L5366">It portended that there was one stone face too many, up at the chateau.</li>
<li class="L5367" rel="L5367"></li>
<li class="L5368" rel="L5368">The Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night, and had added</li>
<li class="L5369" rel="L5369">the one stone face wanting; the stone face for which it had waited</li>
<li class="L5370" rel="L5370">through about two hundred years.</li>
<li class="L5371" rel="L5371"></li>
<li class="L5372" rel="L5372">It lay back on the pillow of Monsieur the Marquis. It was like a fine</li>
<li class="L5373" rel="L5373">mask, suddenly startled, made angry, and petrified. Driven home into the</li>
<li class="L5374" rel="L5374">heart of the stone figure attached to it, was a knife. Round its hilt</li>
<li class="L5375" rel="L5375">was a frill of paper, on which was scrawled:</li>
<li class="L5376" rel="L5376"></li>
<li class="L5377" rel="L5377">“Drive him fast to his tomb. This, from Jacques.”</li>
<li class="L5378" rel="L5378"></li>
<li class="L5379" rel="L5379"></li>
<li class="L5380" rel="L5380"></li>
<li class="L5381" rel="L5381"></li>
<li class="L5382" rel="L5382">X. Two Promises</li>
<li class="L5383" rel="L5383"></li>
<li class="L5384" rel="L5384"></li>
<li class="L5385" rel="L5385">More months, to the number of twelve, had come and gone, and Mr. Charles</li>
<li class="L5386" rel="L5386">Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of the French</li>
<li class="L5387" rel="L5387">language who was conversant with French literature. In this age, he</li>
<li class="L5388" rel="L5388">would have been a Professor; in that age, he was a Tutor. He read with</li>
<li class="L5389" rel="L5389">young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a</li>
<li class="L5390" rel="L5390">living tongue spoken all over the world, and he cultivated a taste for</li>
<li class="L5391" rel="L5391">its stores of knowledge and fancy. He could write of them, besides, in</li>
<li class="L5392" rel="L5392">sound English, and render them into sound English. Such masters were not</li>
<li class="L5393" rel="L5393">at that time easily found; Princes that had been, and Kings that were</li>
<li class="L5394" rel="L5394">to be, were not yet of the Teacher class, and no ruined nobility had</li>
<li class="L5395" rel="L5395">dropped out of Tellson&#39;s ledgers, to turn cooks and carpenters. As a</li>
<li class="L5396" rel="L5396">tutor, whose attainments made the student&#39;s way unusually pleasant and</li>
<li class="L5397" rel="L5397">profitable, and as an elegant translator who brought something to his</li>
<li class="L5398" rel="L5398">work besides mere dictionary knowledge, young Mr. Darnay soon became</li>
<li class="L5399" rel="L5399">known and encouraged. He was well acquainted, more-over, with the</li>
<li class="L5400" rel="L5400">circumstances of his country, and those were of ever-growing interest.</li>
<li class="L5401" rel="L5401">So, with great perseverance and untiring industry, he prospered.</li>
<li class="L5402" rel="L5402"></li>
<li class="L5403" rel="L5403">In London, he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold, nor</li>
<li class="L5404" rel="L5404">to lie on beds of roses; if he had had any such exalted expectation, he</li>
<li class="L5405" rel="L5405">would not have prospered. He had expected labour, and he found it, and</li>
<li class="L5406" rel="L5406">did it and made the best of it. In this, his prosperity consisted.</li>
<li class="L5407" rel="L5407"></li>
<li class="L5408" rel="L5408">A certain portion of his time was passed at Cambridge, where he</li>
<li class="L5409" rel="L5409">read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a</li>
<li class="L5410" rel="L5410">contraband trade in European languages, instead of conveying Greek</li>
<li class="L5411" rel="L5411">and Latin through the Custom-house. The rest of his time he passed in</li>
<li class="L5412" rel="L5412">London.</li>
<li class="L5413" rel="L5413"></li>
<li class="L5414" rel="L5414">Now, from the days when it was always summer in Eden, to these days</li>
<li class="L5415" rel="L5415">when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes, the world of a man has</li>
<li class="L5416" rel="L5416">invariably gone one way--Charles Darnay&#39;s way--the way of the love of a</li>
<li class="L5417" rel="L5417">woman.</li>
<li class="L5418" rel="L5418"></li>
<li class="L5419" rel="L5419">He had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his danger. He had never</li>
<li class="L5420" rel="L5420">heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice;</li>
<li class="L5421" rel="L5421">he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful, as hers when it was</li>
<li class="L5422" rel="L5422">confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for</li>
<li class="L5423" rel="L5423">him. But, he had not yet spoken to her on the subject; the assassination</li>
<li class="L5424" rel="L5424">at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long,</li>
<li class="L5425" rel="L5425">long, dusty roads--the solid stone chateau which had itself become the</li>
<li class="L5426" rel="L5426">mere mist of a dream--had been done a year, and he had never yet, by so</li>
<li class="L5427" rel="L5427">much as a single spoken word, disclosed to her the state of his heart.</li>
<li class="L5428" rel="L5428"></li>
<li class="L5429" rel="L5429">That he had his reasons for this, he knew full well. It was again a</li>
<li class="L5430" rel="L5430">summer day when, lately arrived in London from his college occupation,</li>
<li class="L5431" rel="L5431">he turned into the quiet corner in Soho, bent on seeking an opportunity</li>
<li class="L5432" rel="L5432">of opening his mind to Doctor Manette. It was the close of the summer</li>
<li class="L5433" rel="L5433">day, and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross.</li>
<li class="L5434" rel="L5434"></li>
<li class="L5435" rel="L5435">He found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window. The energy</li>
<li class="L5436" rel="L5436">which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated</li>
<li class="L5437" rel="L5437">their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him. He was now a</li>
<li class="L5438" rel="L5438">very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength</li>
<li class="L5439" rel="L5439">of resolution, and vigour of action. In his recovered energy he was</li>
<li class="L5440" rel="L5440">sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in the</li>
<li class="L5441" rel="L5441">exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been</li>
<li class="L5442" rel="L5442">frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare.</li>
<li class="L5443" rel="L5443"></li>
<li class="L5444" rel="L5444">He studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with</li>
<li class="L5445" rel="L5445">ease, and was equably cheerful. To him, now entered Charles Darnay, at</li>
<li class="L5446" rel="L5446">sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand.</li>
<li class="L5447" rel="L5447"></li>
<li class="L5448" rel="L5448">“Charles Darnay! I rejoice to see you. We have been counting on your</li>
<li class="L5449" rel="L5449">return these three or four days past. Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton were</li>
<li class="L5450" rel="L5450">both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due.”</li>
<li class="L5451" rel="L5451"></li>
<li class="L5452" rel="L5452">“I am obliged to them for their interest in the matter,” he answered,</li>
<li class="L5453" rel="L5453">a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the Doctor. “Miss</li>
<li class="L5454" rel="L5454">Manette--”</li>
<li class="L5455" rel="L5455"></li>
<li class="L5456" rel="L5456">“Is well,” said the Doctor, as he stopped short, “and your return will</li>
<li class="L5457" rel="L5457">delight us all. She has gone out on some household matters, but will</li>
<li class="L5458" rel="L5458">soon be home.”</li>
<li class="L5459" rel="L5459"></li>
<li class="L5460" rel="L5460">“Doctor Manette, I knew she was from home. I took the opportunity of her</li>
<li class="L5461" rel="L5461">being from home, to beg to speak to you.”</li>
<li class="L5462" rel="L5462"></li>
<li class="L5463" rel="L5463">There was a blank silence.</li>
<li class="L5464" rel="L5464"></li>
<li class="L5465" rel="L5465">“Yes?” said the Doctor, with evident constraint. “Bring your chair here,</li>
<li class="L5466" rel="L5466">and speak on.”</li>
<li class="L5467" rel="L5467"></li>
<li class="L5468" rel="L5468">He complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on less</li>
<li class="L5469" rel="L5469">easy.</li>
<li class="L5470" rel="L5470"></li>
<li class="L5471" rel="L5471">“I have had the happiness, Doctor Manette, of being so intimate here,”</li>
<li class="L5472" rel="L5472"> so he at length began, “for some year and a half, that I hope the topic</li>
<li class="L5473" rel="L5473">on which I am about to touch may not--”</li>
<li class="L5474" rel="L5474"></li>
<li class="L5475" rel="L5475">He was stayed by the Doctor&#39;s putting out his hand to stop him. When he</li>
<li class="L5476" rel="L5476">had kept it so a little while, he said, drawing it back:</li>
<li class="L5477" rel="L5477"></li>
<li class="L5478" rel="L5478">“Is Lucie the topic?”</li>
<li class="L5479" rel="L5479"></li>
<li class="L5480" rel="L5480">“She is.”</li>
<li class="L5481" rel="L5481"></li>
<li class="L5482" rel="L5482">“It is hard for me to speak of her at any time. It is very hard for me</li>
<li class="L5483" rel="L5483">to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay.”</li>
<li class="L5484" rel="L5484"></li>
<li class="L5485" rel="L5485">“It is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doctor</li>
<li class="L5486" rel="L5486">Manette!” he said deferentially.</li>
<li class="L5487" rel="L5487"></li>
<li class="L5488" rel="L5488">There was another blank silence before her father rejoined:</li>
<li class="L5489" rel="L5489"></li>
<li class="L5490" rel="L5490">“I believe it. I do you justice; I believe it.”</li>
<li class="L5491" rel="L5491"></li>
<li class="L5492" rel="L5492">His constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that it</li>
<li class="L5493" rel="L5493">originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that Charles</li>
<li class="L5494" rel="L5494">Darnay hesitated.</li>
<li class="L5495" rel="L5495"></li>
<li class="L5496" rel="L5496">“Shall I go on, sir?”</li>
<li class="L5497" rel="L5497"></li>
<li class="L5498" rel="L5498">Another blank.</li>
<li class="L5499" rel="L5499"></li>
<li class="L5500" rel="L5500">“Yes, go on.”</li>
<li class="L5501" rel="L5501"></li>
<li class="L5502" rel="L5502">“You anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how earnestly</li>
<li class="L5503" rel="L5503">I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret heart, and</li>
<li class="L5504" rel="L5504">the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been</li>
<li class="L5505" rel="L5505">laden. Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly,</li>
<li class="L5506" rel="L5506">disinterestedly, devotedly. If ever there were love in the world, I love</li>
<li class="L5507" rel="L5507">her. You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!”</li>
<li class="L5508" rel="L5508"></li>
<li class="L5509" rel="L5509">The Doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on the</li>
<li class="L5510" rel="L5510">ground. At the last words, he stretched out his hand again, hurriedly,</li>
<li class="L5511" rel="L5511">and cried:</li>
<li class="L5512" rel="L5512"></li>
<li class="L5513" rel="L5513">“Not that, sir! Let that be! I adjure you, do not recall that!”</li>
<li class="L5514" rel="L5514"></li>
<li class="L5515" rel="L5515">His cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in Charles</li>
<li class="L5516" rel="L5516">Darnay&#39;s ears long after he had ceased. He motioned with the hand he had</li>
<li class="L5517" rel="L5517">extended, and it seemed to be an appeal to Darnay to pause. The latter</li>
<li class="L5518" rel="L5518">so received it, and remained silent.</li>
<li class="L5519" rel="L5519"></li>
<li class="L5520" rel="L5520">“I ask your pardon,” said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, after some</li>
<li class="L5521" rel="L5521">moments. “I do not doubt your loving Lucie; you may be satisfied of it.”</li>
<li class="L5522" rel="L5522"></li>
<li class="L5523" rel="L5523">He turned towards him in his chair, but did not look at him, or</li>
<li class="L5524" rel="L5524">raise his eyes. His chin dropped upon his hand, and his white hair</li>
<li class="L5525" rel="L5525">overshadowed his face:</li>
<li class="L5526" rel="L5526"></li>
<li class="L5527" rel="L5527">“Have you spoken to Lucie?”</li>
<li class="L5528" rel="L5528"></li>
<li class="L5529" rel="L5529">“No.”</li>
<li class="L5530" rel="L5530"></li>
<li class="L5531" rel="L5531">“Nor written?”</li>
<li class="L5532" rel="L5532"></li>
<li class="L5533" rel="L5533">“Never.”</li>
<li class="L5534" rel="L5534"></li>
<li class="L5535" rel="L5535">“It would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial is</li>
<li class="L5536" rel="L5536">to be referred to your consideration for her father. Her father thanks</li>
<li class="L5537" rel="L5537">you.”</li>
<li class="L5538" rel="L5538"></li>
<li class="L5539" rel="L5539">He offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it.</li>
<li class="L5540" rel="L5540"></li>
<li class="L5541" rel="L5541">“I know,” said Darnay, respectfully, “how can I fail to know, Doctor</li>
<li class="L5542" rel="L5542">Manette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between</li>
<li class="L5543" rel="L5543">you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so</li>
<li class="L5544" rel="L5544">belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that it</li>
<li class="L5545" rel="L5545">can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and</li>
<li class="L5546" rel="L5546">child. I know, Doctor Manette--how can I fail to know--that, mingled</li>
<li class="L5547" rel="L5547">with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman, there</li>
<li class="L5548" rel="L5548">is, in her heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy</li>
<li class="L5549" rel="L5549">itself. I know that, as in her childhood she had no parent, so she is</li>
<li class="L5550" rel="L5550">now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present</li>
<li class="L5551" rel="L5551">years and character, united to the trustfulness and attachment of the</li>
<li class="L5552" rel="L5552">early days in which you were lost to her. I know perfectly well that if</li>
<li class="L5553" rel="L5553">you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life, you could</li>
<li class="L5554" rel="L5554">hardly be invested, in her sight, with a more sacred character than that</li>
<li class="L5555" rel="L5555">in which you are always with her. I know that when she is clinging to</li>
<li class="L5556" rel="L5556">you, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your</li>
<li class="L5557" rel="L5557">neck. I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her</li>
<li class="L5558" rel="L5558">own age, sees and loves you at my age, loves her mother broken-hearted,</li>
<li class="L5559" rel="L5559">loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration. I</li>
<li class="L5560" rel="L5560">have known this, night and day, since I have known you in your home.”</li>
<li class="L5561" rel="L5561"></li>
<li class="L5562" rel="L5562">Her father sat silent, with his face bent down. His breathing was a</li>
<li class="L5563" rel="L5563">little quickened; but he repressed all other signs of agitation.</li>
<li class="L5564" rel="L5564"></li>
<li class="L5565" rel="L5565">“Dear Doctor Manette, always knowing this, always seeing her and you</li>
<li class="L5566" rel="L5566">with this hallowed light about you, I have forborne, and forborne, as</li>
<li class="L5567" rel="L5567">long as it was in the nature of man to do it. I have felt, and do even</li>
<li class="L5568" rel="L5568">now feel, that to bring my love--even mine--between you, is to touch</li>
<li class="L5569" rel="L5569">your history with something not quite so good as itself. But I love her.</li>
<li class="L5570" rel="L5570">Heaven is my witness that I love her!”</li>
<li class="L5571" rel="L5571"></li>
<li class="L5572" rel="L5572">“I believe it,” answered her father, mournfully. “I have thought so</li>
<li class="L5573" rel="L5573">before now. I believe it.”</li>
<li class="L5574" rel="L5574"></li>
<li class="L5575" rel="L5575">“But, do not believe,” said Darnay, upon whose ear the mournful voice</li>
<li class="L5576" rel="L5576">struck with a reproachful sound, “that if my fortune were so cast as</li>
<li class="L5577" rel="L5577">that, being one day so happy as to make her my wife, I must at any time</li>
<li class="L5578" rel="L5578">put any separation between her and you, I could or would breathe a</li>
<li class="L5579" rel="L5579">word of what I now say. Besides that I should know it to be hopeless, I</li>
<li class="L5580" rel="L5580">should know it to be a baseness. If I had any such possibility, even at</li>
<li class="L5581" rel="L5581">a remote distance of years, harboured in my thoughts, and hidden in my</li>
<li class="L5582" rel="L5582">heart--if it ever had been there--if it ever could be there--I could not</li>
<li class="L5583" rel="L5583">now touch this honoured hand.”</li>
<li class="L5584" rel="L5584"></li>
<li class="L5585" rel="L5585">He laid his own upon it as he spoke.</li>
<li class="L5586" rel="L5586"></li>
<li class="L5587" rel="L5587">“No, dear Doctor Manette. Like you, a voluntary exile from France; like</li>
<li class="L5588" rel="L5588">you, driven from it by its distractions, oppressions, and miseries; like</li>
<li class="L5589" rel="L5589">you, striving to live away from it by my own exertions, and trusting</li>
<li class="L5590" rel="L5590">in a happier future; I look only to sharing your fortunes, sharing your</li>
<li class="L5591" rel="L5591">life and home, and being faithful to you to the death. Not to divide</li>
<li class="L5592" rel="L5592">with Lucie her privilege as your child, companion, and friend; but to</li>
<li class="L5593" rel="L5593">come in aid of it, and bind her closer to you, if such a thing can be.”</li>
<li class="L5594" rel="L5594"></li>
<li class="L5595" rel="L5595">His touch still lingered on her father&#39;s hand. Answering the touch for a</li>
<li class="L5596" rel="L5596">moment, but not coldly, her father rested his hands upon the arms of</li>
<li class="L5597" rel="L5597">his chair, and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the</li>
<li class="L5598" rel="L5598">conference. A struggle was evidently in his face; a struggle with that</li>
<li class="L5599" rel="L5599">occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread.</li>
<li class="L5600" rel="L5600"></li>
<li class="L5601" rel="L5601">“You speak so feelingly and so manfully, Charles Darnay, that I thank</li>
<li class="L5602" rel="L5602">you with all my heart, and will open all my heart--or nearly so. Have</li>
<li class="L5603" rel="L5603">you any reason to believe that Lucie loves you?”</li>
<li class="L5604" rel="L5604"></li>
<li class="L5605" rel="L5605">“None. As yet, none.”</li>
<li class="L5606" rel="L5606"></li>
<li class="L5607" rel="L5607">“Is it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once</li>
<li class="L5608" rel="L5608">ascertain that, with my knowledge?”</li>
<li class="L5609" rel="L5609"></li>
<li class="L5610" rel="L5610">“Not even so. I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks; I</li>
<li class="L5611" rel="L5611">might (mistaken or not mistaken) have that hopefulness to-morrow.”</li>
<li class="L5612" rel="L5612"></li>
<li class="L5613" rel="L5613">“Do you seek any guidance from me?”</li>
<li class="L5614" rel="L5614"></li>
<li class="L5615" rel="L5615">“I ask none, sir. But I have thought it possible that you might have it</li>
<li class="L5616" rel="L5616">in your power, if you should deem it right, to give me some.”</li>
<li class="L5617" rel="L5617"></li>
<li class="L5618" rel="L5618">“Do you seek any promise from me?”</li>
<li class="L5619" rel="L5619"></li>
<li class="L5620" rel="L5620">“I do seek that.”</li>
<li class="L5621" rel="L5621"></li>
<li class="L5622" rel="L5622">“What is it?”</li>
<li class="L5623" rel="L5623"></li>
<li class="L5624" rel="L5624">“I well understand that, without you, I could have no hope. I well</li>
<li class="L5625" rel="L5625">understand that, even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her</li>
<li class="L5626" rel="L5626">innocent heart--do not think I have the presumption to assume so much--I</li>
<li class="L5627" rel="L5627">could retain no place in it against her love for her father.”</li>
<li class="L5628" rel="L5628"></li>
<li class="L5629" rel="L5629">“If that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?”</li>
<li class="L5630" rel="L5630"></li>
<li class="L5631" rel="L5631">“I understand equally well, that a word from her father in any suitor&#39;s</li>
<li class="L5632" rel="L5632">favour, would outweigh herself and all the world. For which reason,</li>
<li class="L5633" rel="L5633">Doctor Manette,” said Darnay, modestly but firmly, “I would not ask that</li>
<li class="L5634" rel="L5634">word, to save my life.”</li>
<li class="L5635" rel="L5635"></li>
<li class="L5636" rel="L5636">“I am sure of it. Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love, as</li>
<li class="L5637" rel="L5637">well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and</li>
<li class="L5638" rel="L5638">delicate, and difficult to penetrate. My daughter Lucie is, in this one</li>
<li class="L5639" rel="L5639">respect, such a mystery to me; I can make no guess at the state of her</li>
<li class="L5640" rel="L5640">heart.”</li>
<li class="L5641" rel="L5641"></li>
<li class="L5642" rel="L5642">“May I ask, sir, if you think she is--” As he hesitated, her father</li>
<li class="L5643" rel="L5643">supplied the rest.</li>
<li class="L5644" rel="L5644"></li>
<li class="L5645" rel="L5645">“Is sought by any other suitor?”</li>
<li class="L5646" rel="L5646"></li>
<li class="L5647" rel="L5647">“It is what I meant to say.”</li>
<li class="L5648" rel="L5648"></li>
<li class="L5649" rel="L5649">Her father considered a little before he answered:</li>
<li class="L5650" rel="L5650"></li>
<li class="L5651" rel="L5651">“You have seen Mr. Carton here, yourself. Mr. Stryver is here too,</li>
<li class="L5652" rel="L5652">occasionally. If it be at all, it can only be by one of these.”</li>
<li class="L5653" rel="L5653"></li>
<li class="L5654" rel="L5654">“Or both,” said Darnay.</li>
<li class="L5655" rel="L5655"></li>
<li class="L5656" rel="L5656">“I had not thought of both; I should not think either, likely. You want</li>
<li class="L5657" rel="L5657">a promise from me. Tell me what it is.”</li>
<li class="L5658" rel="L5658"></li>
<li class="L5659" rel="L5659">“It is, that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time, on her own</li>
<li class="L5660" rel="L5660">part, such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you, you will</li>
<li class="L5661" rel="L5661">bear testimony to what I have said, and to your belief in it. I hope you</li>
<li class="L5662" rel="L5662">may be able to think so well of me, as to urge no influence against</li>
<li class="L5663" rel="L5663">me. I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is what I ask. The</li>
<li class="L5664" rel="L5664">condition on which I ask it, and which you have an undoubted right to</li>
<li class="L5665" rel="L5665">require, I will observe immediately.”</li>
<li class="L5666" rel="L5666"></li>
<li class="L5667" rel="L5667">“I give the promise,” said the Doctor, “without any condition. I believe</li>
<li class="L5668" rel="L5668">your object to be, purely and truthfully, as you have stated it. I</li>
<li class="L5669" rel="L5669">believe your intention is to perpetuate, and not to weaken, the ties</li>
<li class="L5670" rel="L5670">between me and my other and far dearer self. If she should ever tell me</li>
<li class="L5671" rel="L5671">that you are essential to her perfect happiness, I will give her to you.</li>
<li class="L5672" rel="L5672">If there were--Charles Darnay, if there were--”</li>
<li class="L5673" rel="L5673"></li>
<li class="L5674" rel="L5674">The young man had taken his hand gratefully; their hands were joined as</li>
<li class="L5675" rel="L5675">the Doctor spoke:</li>
<li class="L5676" rel="L5676"></li>
<li class="L5677" rel="L5677">“--any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatsoever,</li>
<li class="L5678" rel="L5678">new or old, against the man she really loved--the direct responsibility</li>
<li class="L5679" rel="L5679">thereof not lying on his head--they should all be obliterated for her</li>
<li class="L5680" rel="L5680">sake. She is everything to me; more to me than suffering, more to me</li>
<li class="L5681" rel="L5681">than wrong, more to me--Well! This is idle talk.”</li>
<li class="L5682" rel="L5682"></li>
<li class="L5683" rel="L5683">So strange was the way in which he faded into silence, and so strange</li>
<li class="L5684" rel="L5684">his fixed look when he had ceased to speak, that Darnay felt his own</li>
<li class="L5685" rel="L5685">hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it.</li>
<li class="L5686" rel="L5686"></li>
<li class="L5687" rel="L5687">“You said something to me,” said Doctor Manette, breaking into a smile.</li>
<li class="L5688" rel="L5688">“What was it you said to me?”</li>
<li class="L5689" rel="L5689"></li>
<li class="L5690" rel="L5690">He was at a loss how to answer, until he remembered having spoken of a</li>
<li class="L5691" rel="L5691">condition. Relieved as his mind reverted to that, he answered:</li>
<li class="L5692" rel="L5692"></li>
<li class="L5693" rel="L5693">“Your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my</li>
<li class="L5694" rel="L5694">part. My present name, though but slightly changed from my mother&#39;s, is</li>
<li class="L5695" rel="L5695">not, as you will remember, my own. I wish to tell you what that is, and</li>
<li class="L5696" rel="L5696">why I am in England.”</li>
<li class="L5697" rel="L5697"></li>
<li class="L5698" rel="L5698">“Stop!” said the Doctor of Beauvais.</li>
<li class="L5699" rel="L5699"></li>
<li class="L5700" rel="L5700">“I wish it, that I may the better deserve your confidence, and have no</li>
<li class="L5701" rel="L5701">secret from you.”</li>
<li class="L5702" rel="L5702"></li>
<li class="L5703" rel="L5703">“Stop!”</li>
<li class="L5704" rel="L5704"></li>
<li class="L5705" rel="L5705">For an instant, the Doctor even had his two hands at his ears; for</li>
<li class="L5706" rel="L5706">another instant, even had his two hands laid on Darnay&#39;s lips.</li>
<li class="L5707" rel="L5707"></li>
<li class="L5708" rel="L5708">“Tell me when I ask you, not now. If your suit should prosper, if Lucie</li>
<li class="L5709" rel="L5709">should love you, you shall tell me on your marriage morning. Do you</li>
<li class="L5710" rel="L5710">promise?”</li>
<li class="L5711" rel="L5711"></li>
<li class="L5712" rel="L5712">“Willingly.</li>
<li class="L5713" rel="L5713"></li>
<li class="L5714" rel="L5714">“Give me your hand. She will be home directly, and it is better she</li>
<li class="L5715" rel="L5715">should not see us together to-night. Go! God bless you!”</li>
<li class="L5716" rel="L5716"></li>
<li class="L5717" rel="L5717">It was dark when Charles Darnay left him, and it was an hour later and</li>
<li class="L5718" rel="L5718">darker when Lucie came home; she hurried into the room alone--for</li>
<li class="L5719" rel="L5719">Miss Pross had gone straight up-stairs--and was surprised to find his</li>
<li class="L5720" rel="L5720">reading-chair empty.</li>
<li class="L5721" rel="L5721"></li>
<li class="L5722" rel="L5722">“My father!” she called to him. “Father dear!”</li>
<li class="L5723" rel="L5723"></li>
<li class="L5724" rel="L5724">Nothing was said in answer, but she heard a low hammering sound in his</li>
<li class="L5725" rel="L5725">bedroom. Passing lightly across the intermediate room, she looked in at</li>
<li class="L5726" rel="L5726">his door and came running back frightened, crying to herself, with her</li>
<li class="L5727" rel="L5727">blood all chilled, “What shall I do! What shall I do!”</li>
<li class="L5728" rel="L5728"></li>
<li class="L5729" rel="L5729">Her uncertainty lasted but a moment; she hurried back, and tapped at</li>
<li class="L5730" rel="L5730">his door, and softly called to him. The noise ceased at the sound of</li>
<li class="L5731" rel="L5731">her voice, and he presently came out to her, and they walked up and down</li>
<li class="L5732" rel="L5732">together for a long time.</li>
<li class="L5733" rel="L5733"></li>
<li class="L5734" rel="L5734">She came down from her bed, to look at him in his sleep that night. He</li>
<li class="L5735" rel="L5735">slept heavily, and his tray of shoemaking tools, and his old unfinished</li>
<li class="L5736" rel="L5736">work, were all as usual.</li>
<li class="L5737" rel="L5737"></li>
<li class="L5738" rel="L5738"></li>

<li class="L5742" rel="L5742"></li>
<li class="L5743" rel="L5743"></li>
<li class="L5744" rel="L5744">“Sydney,” said Mr. Stryver, on that self-same night, or morning, to his</li>
<li class="L5745" rel="L5745">jackal; “mix another bowl of punch; I have something to say to you.”</li>
<li class="L5746" rel="L5746"></li>
<li class="L5747" rel="L5747">Sydney had been working double tides that night, and the night before,</li>
<li class="L5748" rel="L5748">and the night before that, and a good many nights in succession, making</li>
<li class="L5749" rel="L5749">a grand clearance among Mr. Stryver&#39;s papers before the setting in</li>
<li class="L5750" rel="L5750">of the long vacation. The clearance was effected at last; the Stryver</li>
<li class="L5751" rel="L5751">arrears were handsomely fetched up; everything was got rid of until</li>
<li class="L5752" rel="L5752">November should come with its fogs atmospheric, and fogs legal, and</li>
<li class="L5753" rel="L5753">bring grist to the mill again.</li>
<li class="L5754" rel="L5754"></li>
<li class="L5755" rel="L5755">Sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much</li>
<li class="L5756" rel="L5756">application. It had taken a deal of extra wet-towelling to pull him</li>
<li class="L5757" rel="L5757">through the night; a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded</li>
<li class="L5758" rel="L5758">the towelling; and he was in a very damaged condition, as he now pulled</li>
<li class="L5759" rel="L5759">his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at</li>
<li class="L5760" rel="L5760">intervals for the last six hours.</li>
<li class="L5761" rel="L5761"></li>
<li class="L5762" rel="L5762">“Are you mixing that other bowl of punch?” said Stryver the portly, with</li>
<li class="L5763" rel="L5763">his hands in his waistband, glancing round from the sofa where he lay on</li>
<li class="L5764" rel="L5764">his back.</li>
<li class="L5765" rel="L5765"></li>
<li class="L5766" rel="L5766">“I am.”</li>
<li class="L5767" rel="L5767"></li>
<li class="L5768" rel="L5768">“Now, look here! I am going to tell you something that will rather</li>
<li class="L5769" rel="L5769">surprise you, and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as</li>
<li class="L5770" rel="L5770">shrewd as you usually do think me. I intend to marry.”</li>
<li class="L5771" rel="L5771"></li>
<li class="L5772" rel="L5772">“_Do_ you?”</li>
<li class="L5773" rel="L5773"></li>
<li class="L5774" rel="L5774">“Yes. And not for money. What do you say now?”</li>
<li class="L5775" rel="L5775"></li>
<li class="L5776" rel="L5776">“I don&#39;t feel disposed to say much. Who is she?”</li>
<li class="L5777" rel="L5777"></li>
<li class="L5778" rel="L5778">“Guess.”</li>
<li class="L5779" rel="L5779"></li>
<li class="L5780" rel="L5780">“Do I know her?”</li>
<li class="L5781" rel="L5781"></li>
<li class="L5782" rel="L5782">“Guess.”</li>
<li class="L5783" rel="L5783"></li>
<li class="L5784" rel="L5784">“I am not going to guess, at five o&#39;clock in the morning, with my brains</li>
<li class="L5785" rel="L5785">frying and sputtering in my head. If you want me to guess, you must ask</li>
<li class="L5786" rel="L5786">me to dinner.”</li>
<li class="L5787" rel="L5787"></li>
<li class="L5788" rel="L5788">“Well then, I&#39;ll tell you,” said Stryver, coming slowly into a sitting</li>
<li class="L5789" rel="L5789">posture. “Sydney, I rather despair of making myself intelligible to you,</li>
<li class="L5790" rel="L5790">because you are such an insensible dog.”</li>
<li class="L5791" rel="L5791"></li>
<li class="L5792" rel="L5792">“And you,” returned Sydney, busy concocting the punch, “are such a</li>
<li class="L5793" rel="L5793">sensitive and poetical spirit--”</li>
<li class="L5794" rel="L5794"></li>
<li class="L5795" rel="L5795">“Come!” rejoined Stryver, laughing boastfully, “though I don&#39;t prefer</li>
<li class="L5796" rel="L5796">any claim to being the soul of Romance (for I hope I know better), still</li>
<li class="L5797" rel="L5797">I am a tenderer sort of fellow than _you_.”</li>
<li class="L5798" rel="L5798"></li>
<li class="L5799" rel="L5799">“You are a luckier, if you mean that.”</li>
<li class="L5800" rel="L5800"></li>
<li class="L5801" rel="L5801">“I don&#39;t mean that. I mean I am a man of more--more--”</li>
<li class="L5802" rel="L5802"></li>
<li class="L5803" rel="L5803">“Say gallantry, while you are about it,” suggested Carton.</li>
<li class="L5804" rel="L5804"></li>
<li class="L5805" rel="L5805">“Well! I&#39;ll say gallantry. My meaning is that I am a man,” said Stryver,</li>
<li class="L5806" rel="L5806">inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch, “who cares more to</li>
<li class="L5807" rel="L5807">be agreeable, who takes more pains to be agreeable, who knows better how</li>
<li class="L5808" rel="L5808">to be agreeable, in a woman&#39;s society, than you do.”</li>
<li class="L5809" rel="L5809"></li>
<li class="L5810" rel="L5810">“Go on,” said Sydney Carton.</li>
<li class="L5811" rel="L5811"></li>
<li class="L5812" rel="L5812">“No; but before I go on,” said Stryver, shaking his head in his bullying</li>
<li class="L5813" rel="L5813">way, “I&#39;ll have this out with you. You&#39;ve been at Doctor Manette&#39;s house</li>
<li class="L5814" rel="L5814">as much as I have, or more than I have. Why, I have been ashamed of your</li>
<li class="L5815" rel="L5815">moroseness there! Your manners have been of that silent and sullen and</li>
<li class="L5816" rel="L5816">hangdog kind, that, upon my life and soul, I have been ashamed of you,</li>
<li class="L5817" rel="L5817">Sydney!”</li>
<li class="L5818" rel="L5818"></li>
<li class="L5819" rel="L5819">“It should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar, to</li>
<li class="L5820" rel="L5820">be ashamed of anything,” returned Sydney; “you ought to be much obliged</li>
<li class="L5821" rel="L5821">to me.”</li>
<li class="L5822" rel="L5822"></li>
<li class="L5823" rel="L5823">“You shall not get off in that way,” rejoined Stryver, shouldering the</li>
<li class="L5824" rel="L5824">rejoinder at him; “no, Sydney, it&#39;s my duty to tell you--and I tell you</li>
<li class="L5825" rel="L5825">to your face to do you good--that you are a devilish ill-conditioned</li>
<li class="L5826" rel="L5826">fellow in that sort of society. You are a disagreeable fellow.”</li>
<li class="L5827" rel="L5827"></li>
<li class="L5828" rel="L5828">Sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made, and laughed.</li>
<li class="L5829" rel="L5829"></li>
<li class="L5830" rel="L5830">“Look at me!” said Stryver, squaring himself; “I have less need to make</li>
<li class="L5831" rel="L5831">myself agreeable than you have, being more independent in circumstances.</li>
<li class="L5832" rel="L5832">Why do I do it?”</li>
<li class="L5833" rel="L5833"></li>
<li class="L5834" rel="L5834">“I never saw you do it yet,” muttered Carton.</li>
<li class="L5835" rel="L5835"></li>
<li class="L5836" rel="L5836">“I do it because it&#39;s politic; I do it on principle. And look at me! I</li>
<li class="L5837" rel="L5837">get on.”</li>
<li class="L5838" rel="L5838"></li>
<li class="L5839" rel="L5839">“You don&#39;t get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions,”</li>
<li class="L5840" rel="L5840"> answered Carton, with a careless air; “I wish you would keep to that. As</li>
<li class="L5841" rel="L5841">to me--will you never understand that I am incorrigible?”</li>
<li class="L5842" rel="L5842"></li>
<li class="L5843" rel="L5843">He asked the question with some appearance of scorn.</li>
<li class="L5844" rel="L5844"></li>
<li class="L5845" rel="L5845">“You have no business to be incorrigible,” was his friend&#39;s answer,</li>
<li class="L5846" rel="L5846">delivered in no very soothing tone.</li>
<li class="L5847" rel="L5847"></li>
<li class="L5848" rel="L5848">“I have no business to be, at all, that I know of,” said Sydney Carton.</li>
<li class="L5849" rel="L5849">“Who is the lady?”</li>
<li class="L5850" rel="L5850"></li>
<li class="L5851" rel="L5851">“Now, don&#39;t let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable,</li>
<li class="L5852" rel="L5852">Sydney,” said Mr. Stryver, preparing him with ostentatious friendliness</li>
<li class="L5853" rel="L5853">for the disclosure he was about to make, “because I know you don&#39;t mean</li>
<li class="L5854" rel="L5854">half you say; and if you meant it all, it would be of no importance. I</li>
<li class="L5855" rel="L5855">make this little preface, because you once mentioned the young lady to</li>
<li class="L5856" rel="L5856">me in slighting terms.”</li>
<li class="L5857" rel="L5857"></li>
<li class="L5858" rel="L5858">“I did?”</li>
<li class="L5859" rel="L5859"></li>
<li class="L5860" rel="L5860">“Certainly; and in these chambers.”</li>
<li class="L5861" rel="L5861"></li>
<li class="L5862" rel="L5862">Sydney Carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend;</li>
<li class="L5863" rel="L5863">drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend.</li>
<li class="L5864" rel="L5864"></li>
<li class="L5865" rel="L5865">“You made mention of the young lady as a golden-haired doll. The young</li>
<li class="L5866" rel="L5866">lady is Miss Manette. If you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or</li>
<li class="L5867" rel="L5867">delicacy of feeling in that kind of way, Sydney, I might have been a</li>
<li class="L5868" rel="L5868">little resentful of your employing such a designation; but you are not.</li>
<li class="L5869" rel="L5869">You want that sense altogether; therefore I am no more annoyed when I</li>
<li class="L5870" rel="L5870">think of the expression, than I should be annoyed by a man&#39;s opinion of</li>
<li class="L5871" rel="L5871">a picture of mine, who had no eye for pictures: or of a piece of music</li>
<li class="L5872" rel="L5872">of mine, who had no ear for music.”</li>
<li class="L5873" rel="L5873"></li>
<li class="L5874" rel="L5874">Sydney Carton drank the punch at a great rate; drank it by bumpers,</li>
<li class="L5875" rel="L5875">looking at his friend.</li>
<li class="L5876" rel="L5876"></li>
<li class="L5877" rel="L5877">“Now you know all about it, Syd,” said Mr. Stryver. “I don&#39;t care about</li>
<li class="L5878" rel="L5878">fortune: she is a charming creature, and I have made up my mind to</li>
<li class="L5879" rel="L5879">please myself: on the whole, I think I can afford to please myself. She</li>
<li class="L5880" rel="L5880">will have in me a man already pretty well off, and a rapidly rising man,</li>
<li class="L5881" rel="L5881">and a man of some distinction: it is a piece of good fortune for her,</li>
<li class="L5882" rel="L5882">but she is worthy of good fortune. Are you astonished?”</li>
<li class="L5883" rel="L5883"></li>
<li class="L5884" rel="L5884">Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, “Why should I be</li>
<li class="L5885" rel="L5885">astonished?”</li>
<li class="L5886" rel="L5886"></li>
<li class="L5887" rel="L5887">“You approve?”</li>
<li class="L5888" rel="L5888"></li>
<li class="L5889" rel="L5889">Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, “Why should I not approve?”</li>
<li class="L5890" rel="L5890"></li>
<li class="L5891" rel="L5891">“Well!” said his friend Stryver, “you take it more easily than I fancied</li>
<li class="L5892" rel="L5892">you would, and are less mercenary on my behalf than I thought you would</li>
<li class="L5893" rel="L5893">be; though, to be sure, you know well enough by this time that your</li>
<li class="L5894" rel="L5894">ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will. Yes, Sydney, I have had</li>
<li class="L5895" rel="L5895">enough of this style of life, with no other as a change from it; I</li>
<li class="L5896" rel="L5896">feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels</li>
<li class="L5897" rel="L5897">inclined to go to it (when he doesn&#39;t, he can stay away), and I feel</li>
<li class="L5898" rel="L5898">that Miss Manette will tell well in any station, and will always do me</li>
<li class="L5899" rel="L5899">credit. So I have made up my mind. And now, Sydney, old boy, I want to</li>
<li class="L5900" rel="L5900">say a word to _you_ about _your_ prospects. You are in a bad way, you</li>
<li class="L5901" rel="L5901">know; you really are in a bad way. You don&#39;t know the value of money,</li>
<li class="L5902" rel="L5902">you live hard, you&#39;ll knock up one of these days, and be ill and poor;</li>
<li class="L5903" rel="L5903">you really ought to think about a nurse.”</li>
<li class="L5904" rel="L5904"></li>
<li class="L5905" rel="L5905">The prosperous patronage with which he said it, made him look twice as</li>
<li class="L5906" rel="L5906">big as he was, and four times as offensive.</li>
<li class="L5907" rel="L5907"></li>
<li class="L5908" rel="L5908">“Now, let me recommend you,” pursued Stryver, “to look it in the face.</li>
<li class="L5909" rel="L5909">I have looked it in the face, in my different way; look it in the face,</li>
<li class="L5910" rel="L5910">you, in your different way. Marry. Provide somebody to take care of</li>
<li class="L5911" rel="L5911">you. Never mind your having no enjoyment of women&#39;s society, nor</li>
<li class="L5912" rel="L5912">understanding of it, nor tact for it. Find out somebody. Find out some</li>
<li class="L5913" rel="L5913">respectable woman with a little property--somebody in the landlady way,</li>
<li class="L5914" rel="L5914">or lodging-letting way--and marry her, against a rainy day. That&#39;s the</li>
<li class="L5915" rel="L5915">kind of thing for _you_. Now think of it, Sydney.”</li>
<li class="L5916" rel="L5916"></li>
<li class="L5917" rel="L5917">“I&#39;ll think of it,” said Sydney.</li>
<li class="L5918" rel="L5918"></li>
<li class="L5919" rel="L5919"></li>
<li class="L5920" rel="L5920"></li>
<li class="L5921" rel="L5921"></li>
<li class="L5922" rel="L5922">XII. The Fellow of Delicacy</li>
<li class="L5923" rel="L5923"></li>
<li class="L5924" rel="L5924"></li>
<li class="L5925" rel="L5925">Mr. Stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good</li>
<li class="L5926" rel="L5926">fortune on the Doctor&#39;s daughter, resolved to make her happiness known</li>
<li class="L5927" rel="L5927">to her before he left town for the Long Vacation. After some mental</li>
<li class="L5928" rel="L5928">debating of the point, he came to the conclusion that it would be as</li>
<li class="L5929" rel="L5929">well to get all the preliminaries done with, and they could then arrange</li>
<li class="L5930" rel="L5930">at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two</li>
<li class="L5931" rel="L5931">before Michaelmas Term, or in the little Christmas vacation between it</li>
<li class="L5932" rel="L5932">and Hilary.</li>
<li class="L5933" rel="L5933"></li>
<li class="L5934" rel="L5934">As to the strength of his case, he had not a doubt about it, but clearly</li>
<li class="L5935" rel="L5935">saw his way to the verdict. Argued with the jury on substantial worldly</li>
<li class="L5936" rel="L5936">grounds--the only grounds ever worth taking into account--it was a</li>
<li class="L5937" rel="L5937">plain case, and had not a weak spot in it. He called himself for the</li>
<li class="L5938" rel="L5938">plaintiff, there was no getting over his evidence, the counsel for</li>
<li class="L5939" rel="L5939">the defendant threw up his brief, and the jury did not even turn to</li>
<li class="L5940" rel="L5940">consider. After trying it, Stryver, C. J., was satisfied that no plainer</li>
<li class="L5941" rel="L5941">case could be.</li>
<li class="L5942" rel="L5942"></li>
<li class="L5943" rel="L5943">Accordingly, Mr. Stryver inaugurated the Long Vacation with a formal</li>
<li class="L5944" rel="L5944">proposal to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens; that failing, to</li>
<li class="L5945" rel="L5945">Ranelagh; that unaccountably failing too, it behoved him to present</li>
<li class="L5946" rel="L5946">himself in Soho, and there declare his noble mind.</li>
<li class="L5947" rel="L5947"></li>
<li class="L5948" rel="L5948">Towards Soho, therefore, Mr. Stryver shouldered his way from the Temple,</li>
<li class="L5949" rel="L5949">while the bloom of the Long Vacation&#39;s infancy was still upon it.</li>
<li class="L5950" rel="L5950">Anybody who had seen him projecting himself into Soho while he was yet</li>
<li class="L5951" rel="L5951">on Saint Dunstan&#39;s side of Temple Bar, bursting in his full-blown way</li>
<li class="L5952" rel="L5952">along the pavement, to the jostlement of all weaker people, might have</li>
<li class="L5953" rel="L5953">seen how safe and strong he was.</li>
<li class="L5954" rel="L5954"></li>
<li class="L5955" rel="L5955">His way taking him past Tellson&#39;s, and he both banking at Tellson&#39;s and</li>
<li class="L5956" rel="L5956">knowing Mr. Lorry as the intimate friend of the Manettes, it entered Mr.</li>
<li class="L5957" rel="L5957">Stryver&#39;s mind to enter the bank, and reveal to Mr. Lorry the brightness</li>
<li class="L5958" rel="L5958">of the Soho horizon. So, he pushed open the door with the weak rattle</li>
<li class="L5959" rel="L5959">in its throat, stumbled down the two steps, got past the two ancient</li>
<li class="L5960" rel="L5960">cashiers, and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where Mr.</li>
<li class="L5961" rel="L5961">Lorry sat at great books ruled for figures, with perpendicular iron</li>
<li class="L5962" rel="L5962">bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too, and everything</li>
<li class="L5963" rel="L5963">under the clouds were a sum.</li>
<li class="L5964" rel="L5964"></li>
<li class="L5965" rel="L5965">“Halloa!” said Mr. Stryver. “How do you do? I hope you are well!”</li>
<li class="L5966" rel="L5966"></li>
<li class="L5967" rel="L5967">It was Stryver&#39;s grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any</li>
<li class="L5968" rel="L5968">place, or space. He was so much too big for Tellson&#39;s, that old clerks</li>
<li class="L5969" rel="L5969">in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he</li>
<li class="L5970" rel="L5970">squeezed them against the wall. The House itself, magnificently reading</li>
<li class="L5971" rel="L5971">the paper quite in the far-off perspective, lowered displeased, as if</li>
<li class="L5972" rel="L5972">the Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat.</li>
<li class="L5973" rel="L5973"></li>
<li class="L5974" rel="L5974">The discreet Mr. Lorry said, in a sample tone of the voice he would</li>
<li class="L5975" rel="L5975">recommend under the circumstances, “How do you do, Mr. Stryver? How do</li>
<li class="L5976" rel="L5976">you do, sir?” and shook hands. There was a peculiarity in his manner</li>
<li class="L5977" rel="L5977">of shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson&#39;s who shook</li>
<li class="L5978" rel="L5978">hands with a customer when the House pervaded the air. He shook in a</li>
<li class="L5979" rel="L5979">self-abnegating way, as one who shook for Tellson and Co.</li>
<li class="L5980" rel="L5980"></li>
<li class="L5981" rel="L5981">“Can I do anything for you, Mr. Stryver?” asked Mr. Lorry, in his</li>
<li class="L5982" rel="L5982">business character.</li>
<li class="L5983" rel="L5983"></li>
<li class="L5984" rel="L5984">“Why, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry; I</li>
<li class="L5985" rel="L5985">have come for a private word.”</li>
<li class="L5986" rel="L5986"></li>
<li class="L5987" rel="L5987">“Oh indeed!” said Mr. Lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye strayed</li>
<li class="L5988" rel="L5988">to the House afar off.</li>
<li class="L5989" rel="L5989"></li>
<li class="L5990" rel="L5990">“I am going,” said Mr. Stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on the</li>
<li class="L5991" rel="L5991">desk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to</li>
<li class="L5992" rel="L5992">be not half desk enough for him: “I am going to make an offer of myself</li>
<li class="L5993" rel="L5993">in marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry.”</li>
<li class="L5994" rel="L5994"></li>
<li class="L5995" rel="L5995">“Oh dear me!” cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his</li>
<li class="L5996" rel="L5996">visitor dubiously.</li>
<li class="L5997" rel="L5997"></li>
<li class="L5998" rel="L5998">“Oh dear me, sir?” repeated Stryver, drawing back. “Oh dear you, sir?</li>
<li class="L5999" rel="L5999">What may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?”</li>
<li class="L6000" rel="L6000"></li>
<li class="L6001" rel="L6001">“My meaning,” answered the man of business, “is, of course, friendly and</li>
<li class="L6002" rel="L6002">appreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and--in short,</li>
<li class="L6003" rel="L6003">my meaning is everything you could desire. But--really, you know, Mr.</li>
<li class="L6004" rel="L6004">Stryver--” Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his head at him in the oddest</li>
<li class="L6005" rel="L6005">manner, as if he were compelled against his will to add, internally,</li>
<li class="L6006" rel="L6006">“you know there really is so much too much of you!”</li>
<li class="L6007" rel="L6007"></li>
<li class="L6008" rel="L6008">“Well!” said Stryver, slapping the desk with his contentious hand,</li>
<li class="L6009" rel="L6009">opening his eyes wider, and taking a long breath, “if I understand you,</li>
<li class="L6010" rel="L6010">Mr. Lorry, I&#39;ll be hanged!”</li>
<li class="L6011" rel="L6011"></li>
<li class="L6012" rel="L6012">Mr. Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that</li>
<li class="L6013" rel="L6013">end, and bit the feather of a pen.</li>
<li class="L6014" rel="L6014"></li>
<li class="L6015" rel="L6015">“D--n it all, sir!” said Stryver, staring at him, “am I not eligible?”</li>
<li class="L6016" rel="L6016"></li>
<li class="L6017" rel="L6017">“Oh dear yes! Yes. Oh yes, you&#39;re eligible!” said Mr. Lorry. “If you say</li>
<li class="L6018" rel="L6018">eligible, you are eligible.”</li>
<li class="L6019" rel="L6019"></li>
<li class="L6020" rel="L6020">“Am I not prosperous?” asked Stryver.</li>
<li class="L6021" rel="L6021"></li>
<li class="L6022" rel="L6022">“Oh! if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous,” said Mr. Lorry.</li>
<li class="L6023" rel="L6023"></li>
<li class="L6024" rel="L6024">“And advancing?”</li>
<li class="L6025" rel="L6025"></li>
<li class="L6026" rel="L6026">“If you come to advancing you know,” said Mr. Lorry, delighted to be</li>
<li class="L6027" rel="L6027">able to make another admission, “nobody can doubt that.”</li>
<li class="L6028" rel="L6028"></li>
<li class="L6029" rel="L6029">“Then what on earth is your meaning, Mr. Lorry?” demanded Stryver,</li>
<li class="L6030" rel="L6030">perceptibly crestfallen.</li>
<li class="L6031" rel="L6031"></li>
<li class="L6032" rel="L6032">“Well! I--Were you going there now?” asked Mr. Lorry.</li>
<li class="L6033" rel="L6033"></li>
<li class="L6034" rel="L6034">“Straight!” said Stryver, with a plump of his fist on the desk.</li>
<li class="L6035" rel="L6035"></li>
<li class="L6036" rel="L6036">“Then I think I wouldn&#39;t, if I was you.”</li>
<li class="L6037" rel="L6037"></li>
<li class="L6038" rel="L6038">“Why?” said Stryver. “Now, I&#39;ll put you in a corner,” forensically</li>
<li class="L6039" rel="L6039">shaking a forefinger at him. “You are a man of business and bound to</li>
<li class="L6040" rel="L6040">have a reason. State your reason. Why wouldn&#39;t you go?”</li>
<li class="L6041" rel="L6041"></li>
<li class="L6042" rel="L6042">“Because,” said Mr. Lorry, “I wouldn&#39;t go on such an object without</li>
<li class="L6043" rel="L6043">having some cause to believe that I should succeed.”</li>
<li class="L6044" rel="L6044"></li>
<li class="L6045" rel="L6045">“D--n _me_!” cried Stryver, “but this beats everything.”</li>
<li class="L6046" rel="L6046"></li>
<li class="L6047" rel="L6047">Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and glanced at the angry</li>
<li class="L6048" rel="L6048">Stryver.</li>
<li class="L6049" rel="L6049"></li>
<li class="L6050" rel="L6050">“Here&#39;s a man of business--a man of years--a man of experience--_in_</li>
<li class="L6051" rel="L6051">a Bank,” said Stryver; “and having summed up three leading reasons for</li>
<li class="L6052" rel="L6052">complete success, he says there&#39;s no reason at all! Says it with his</li>
<li class="L6053" rel="L6053">head on!” Mr. Stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have</li>
<li class="L6054" rel="L6054">been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off.</li>
<li class="L6055" rel="L6055"></li>
<li class="L6056" rel="L6056">“When I speak of success, I speak of success with the young lady; and</li>
<li class="L6057" rel="L6057">when I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable, I speak of</li>
<li class="L6058" rel="L6058">causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady. The young</li>
<li class="L6059" rel="L6059">lady, my good sir,” said Mr. Lorry, mildly tapping the Stryver arm, “the</li>
<li class="L6060" rel="L6060">young lady. The young lady goes before all.”</li>
<li class="L6061" rel="L6061"></li>
<li class="L6062" rel="L6062">“Then you mean to tell me, Mr. Lorry,” said Stryver, squaring his</li>
<li class="L6063" rel="L6063">elbows, “that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at</li>
<li class="L6064" rel="L6064">present in question is a mincing Fool?”</li>
<li class="L6065" rel="L6065"></li>
<li class="L6066" rel="L6066">“Not exactly so. I mean to tell you, Mr. Stryver,” said Mr. Lorry,</li>
<li class="L6067" rel="L6067">reddening, “that I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady</li>
<li class="L6068" rel="L6068">from any lips; and that if I knew any man--which I hope I do not--whose</li>
<li class="L6069" rel="L6069">taste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that he could</li>
<li class="L6070" rel="L6070">not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at</li>
<li class="L6071" rel="L6071">this desk, not even Tellson&#39;s should prevent my giving him a piece of my</li>
<li class="L6072" rel="L6072">mind.”</li>
<li class="L6073" rel="L6073"></li>
<li class="L6074" rel="L6074">The necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr. Stryver&#39;s</li>
<li class="L6075" rel="L6075">blood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry;</li>
<li class="L6076" rel="L6076">Mr. Lorry&#39;s veins, methodical as their courses could usually be, were in</li>
<li class="L6077" rel="L6077">no better state now it was his turn.</li>
<li class="L6078" rel="L6078"></li>
<li class="L6079" rel="L6079">“That is what I mean to tell you, sir,” said Mr. Lorry. “Pray let there</li>
<li class="L6080" rel="L6080">be no mistake about it.”</li>
<li class="L6081" rel="L6081"></li>
<li class="L6082" rel="L6082">Mr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood</li>
<li class="L6083" rel="L6083">hitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him the</li>
<li class="L6084" rel="L6084">toothache. He broke the awkward silence by saying:</li>
<li class="L6085" rel="L6085"></li>
<li class="L6086" rel="L6086">“This is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. You deliberately advise me not</li>
<li class="L6087" rel="L6087">to go up to Soho and offer myself--_my_self, Stryver of the King&#39;s Bench</li>
<li class="L6088" rel="L6088">bar?”</li>
<li class="L6089" rel="L6089"></li>
<li class="L6090" rel="L6090">“Do you ask me for my advice, Mr. Stryver?”</li>
<li class="L6091" rel="L6091"></li>
<li class="L6092" rel="L6092">“Yes, I do.”</li>
<li class="L6093" rel="L6093"></li>
<li class="L6094" rel="L6094">“Very good. Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly.”</li>
<li class="L6095" rel="L6095"></li>
<li class="L6096" rel="L6096">“And all I can say of it is,” laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, “that</li>
<li class="L6097" rel="L6097">this--ha, ha!--beats everything past, present, and to come.”</li>
<li class="L6098" rel="L6098"></li>
<li class="L6099" rel="L6099">“Now understand me,” pursued Mr. Lorry. “As a man of business, I am</li>
<li class="L6100" rel="L6100">not justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of</li>
<li class="L6101" rel="L6101">business, I know nothing of it. But, as an old fellow, who has carried</li>
<li class="L6102" rel="L6102">Miss Manette in his arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and</li>
<li class="L6103" rel="L6103">of her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I have</li>
<li class="L6104" rel="L6104">spoken. The confidence is not of my seeking, recollect. Now, you think I</li>
<li class="L6105" rel="L6105">may not be right?”</li>
<li class="L6106" rel="L6106"></li>
<li class="L6107" rel="L6107">“Not I!” said Stryver, whistling. “I can&#39;t undertake to find third</li>
<li class="L6108" rel="L6108">parties in common sense; I can only find it for myself. I suppose sense</li>
<li class="L6109" rel="L6109">in certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense. It&#39;s</li>
<li class="L6110" rel="L6110">new to me, but you are right, I dare say.”</li>
<li class="L6111" rel="L6111"></li>
<li class="L6112" rel="L6112">“What I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself--And</li>
<li class="L6113" rel="L6113">understand me, sir,” said Mr. Lorry, quickly flushing again, “I</li>
<li class="L6114" rel="L6114">will not--not even at Tellson&#39;s--have it characterised for me by any</li>
<li class="L6115" rel="L6115">gentleman breathing.”</li>
<li class="L6116" rel="L6116"></li>
<li class="L6117" rel="L6117">“There! I beg your pardon!” said Stryver.</li>
<li class="L6118" rel="L6118"></li>
<li class="L6119" rel="L6119">“Granted. Thank you. Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to say:--it might be</li>
<li class="L6120" rel="L6120">painful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful to Doctor</li>
<li class="L6121" rel="L6121">Manette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might be very</li>
<li class="L6122" rel="L6122">painful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with you. You</li>
<li class="L6123" rel="L6123">know the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with</li>
<li class="L6124" rel="L6124">the family. If you please, committing you in no way, representing you</li>
<li class="L6125" rel="L6125">in no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a</li>
<li class="L6126" rel="L6126">little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon</li>
<li class="L6127" rel="L6127">it. If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test its</li>
<li class="L6128" rel="L6128">soundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied</li>
<li class="L6129" rel="L6129">with it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is</li>
<li class="L6130" rel="L6130">best spared. What do you say?”</li>
<li class="L6131" rel="L6131"></li>
<li class="L6132" rel="L6132">“How long would you keep me in town?”</li>
<li class="L6133" rel="L6133"></li>
<li class="L6134" rel="L6134">“Oh! It is only a question of a few hours. I could go to Soho in the</li>
<li class="L6135" rel="L6135">evening, and come to your chambers afterwards.”</li>
<li class="L6136" rel="L6136"></li>
<li class="L6137" rel="L6137">“Then I say yes,” said Stryver: “I won&#39;t go up there now, I am not so</li>
<li class="L6138" rel="L6138">hot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look</li>
<li class="L6139" rel="L6139">in to-night. Good morning.”</li>
<li class="L6140" rel="L6140"></li>
<li class="L6141" rel="L6141">Then Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a</li>
<li class="L6142" rel="L6142">concussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against it</li>
<li class="L6143" rel="L6143">bowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength</li>
<li class="L6144" rel="L6144">of the two ancient clerks. Those venerable and feeble persons were</li>
<li class="L6145" rel="L6145">always seen by the public in the act of bowing, and were popularly</li>
<li class="L6146" rel="L6146">believed, when they had bowed a customer out, still to keep on bowing in</li>
<li class="L6147" rel="L6147">the empty office until they bowed another customer in.</li>
<li class="L6148" rel="L6148"></li>
<li class="L6149" rel="L6149">The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have</li>
<li class="L6150" rel="L6150">gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than</li>
<li class="L6151" rel="L6151">moral certainty. Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to</li>
<li class="L6152" rel="L6152">swallow, he got it down. “And now,” said Mr. Stryver, shaking his</li>
<li class="L6153" rel="L6153">forensic forefinger at the Temple in general, when it was down, “my way</li>
<li class="L6154" rel="L6154">out of this, is, to put you all in the wrong.”</li>
<li class="L6155" rel="L6155"></li>
<li class="L6156" rel="L6156">It was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician, in which he found</li>
<li class="L6157" rel="L6157">great relief. “You shall not put me in the wrong, young lady,” said Mr.</li>
<li class="L6158" rel="L6158">Stryver; “I&#39;ll do that for you.”</li>
<li class="L6159" rel="L6159"></li>
<li class="L6160" rel="L6160">Accordingly, when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten o&#39;clock,</li>
<li class="L6161" rel="L6161">Mr. Stryver, among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the</li>
<li class="L6162" rel="L6162">purpose, seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of</li>
<li class="L6163" rel="L6163">the morning. He even showed surprise when he saw Mr. Lorry, and was</li>
<li class="L6164" rel="L6164">altogether in an absent and preoccupied state.</li>
<li class="L6165" rel="L6165"></li>
<li class="L6166" rel="L6166">“Well!” said that good-natured emissary, after a full half-hour of</li>
<li class="L6167" rel="L6167">bootless attempts to bring him round to the question. “I have been to</li>
<li class="L6168" rel="L6168">Soho.”</li>
<li class="L6169" rel="L6169"></li>
<li class="L6170" rel="L6170">“To Soho?” repeated Mr. Stryver, coldly. “Oh, to be sure! What am I</li>
<li class="L6171" rel="L6171">thinking of!”</li>
<li class="L6172" rel="L6172"></li>
<li class="L6173" rel="L6173">“And I have no doubt,” said Mr. Lorry, “that I was right in the</li>
<li class="L6174" rel="L6174">conversation we had. My opinion is confirmed, and I reiterate my</li>
<li class="L6175" rel="L6175">advice.”</li>
<li class="L6176" rel="L6176"></li>
<li class="L6177" rel="L6177">“I assure you,” returned Mr. Stryver, in the friendliest way, “that I</li>
<li class="L6178" rel="L6178">am sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on the poor father&#39;s</li>
<li class="L6179" rel="L6179">account. I know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let</li>
<li class="L6180" rel="L6180">us say no more about it.”</li>
<li class="L6181" rel="L6181"></li>
<li class="L6182" rel="L6182">“I don&#39;t understand you,” said Mr. Lorry.</li>
<li class="L6183" rel="L6183"></li>
<li class="L6184" rel="L6184">“I dare say not,” rejoined Stryver, nodding his head in a smoothing and</li>
<li class="L6185" rel="L6185">final way; “no matter, no matter.”</li>
<li class="L6186" rel="L6186"></li>
<li class="L6187" rel="L6187">“But it does matter,” Mr. Lorry urged.</li>
<li class="L6188" rel="L6188"></li>
<li class="L6189" rel="L6189">“No it doesn&#39;t; I assure you it doesn&#39;t. Having supposed that there was</li>
<li class="L6190" rel="L6190">sense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there is</li>
<li class="L6191" rel="L6191">not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm is</li>
<li class="L6192" rel="L6192">done. Young women have committed similar follies often before, and have</li>
<li class="L6193" rel="L6193">repented them in poverty and obscurity often before. In an unselfish</li>
<li class="L6194" rel="L6194">aspect, I am sorry that the thing is dropped, because it would have been</li>
<li class="L6195" rel="L6195">a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view; in a selfish aspect, I am</li>
<li class="L6196" rel="L6196">glad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been a bad thing</li>
<li class="L6197" rel="L6197">for me in a worldly point of view--it is hardly necessary to say I could</li>
<li class="L6198" rel="L6198">have gained nothing by it. There is no harm at all done. I have not</li>
<li class="L6199" rel="L6199">proposed to the young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by no means</li>
<li class="L6200" rel="L6200">certain, on reflection, that I ever should have committed myself to</li>
<li class="L6201" rel="L6201">that extent. Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the mincing vanities and</li>
<li class="L6202" rel="L6202">giddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or you</li>
<li class="L6203" rel="L6203">will always be disappointed. Now, pray say no more about it. I tell you,</li>
<li class="L6204" rel="L6204">I regret it on account of others, but I am satisfied on my own account.</li>
<li class="L6205" rel="L6205">And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you,</li>
<li class="L6206" rel="L6206">and for giving me your advice; you know the young lady better than I do;</li>
<li class="L6207" rel="L6207">you were right, it never would have done.”</li>
<li class="L6208" rel="L6208"></li>
<li class="L6209" rel="L6209">Mr. Lorry was so taken aback, that he looked quite stupidly at Mr.</li>
<li class="L6210" rel="L6210">Stryver shouldering him towards the door, with an appearance of</li>
<li class="L6211" rel="L6211">showering generosity, forbearance, and goodwill, on his erring head.</li>
<li class="L6212" rel="L6212">“Make the best of it, my dear sir,” said Stryver; “say no more about it;</li>
<li class="L6213" rel="L6213">thank you again for allowing me to sound you; good night!”</li>
<li class="L6214" rel="L6214"></li>
<li class="L6215" rel="L6215">Mr. Lorry was out in the night, before he knew where he was. Mr. Stryver</li>
<li class="L6216" rel="L6216">was lying back on his sofa, winking at his ceiling.</li>
<li class="L6217" rel="L6217"></li>
<li class="L6218" rel="L6218"></li>
<li class="L6219" rel="L6219"></li>
<li class="L6220" rel="L6220"></li>
<li class="L6221" rel="L6221">XIII. The Fellow of No Delicacy</li>
<li class="L6222" rel="L6222"></li>
<li class="L6223" rel="L6223"></li>
<li class="L6224" rel="L6224">If Sydney Carton ever shone anywhere, he certainly never shone in the</li>
<li class="L6225" rel="L6225">house of Doctor Manette. He had been there often, during a whole year,</li>
<li class="L6226" rel="L6226">and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there. When he</li>
<li class="L6227" rel="L6227">cared to talk, he talked well; but, the cloud of caring for nothing,</li>
<li class="L6228" rel="L6228">which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness, was very rarely</li>
<li class="L6229" rel="L6229">pierced by the light within him.</li>
<li class="L6230" rel="L6230"></li>
<li class="L6231" rel="L6231">And yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house,</li>
<li class="L6232" rel="L6232">and for the senseless stones that made their pavements. Many a night</li>
<li class="L6233" rel="L6233">he vaguely and unhappily wandered there, when wine had brought no</li>
<li class="L6234" rel="L6234">transitory gladness to him; many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary</li>
<li class="L6235" rel="L6235">figure lingering there, and still lingering there when the first beams</li>
<li class="L6236" rel="L6236">of the sun brought into strong relief, removed beauties of architecture</li>
<li class="L6237" rel="L6237">in spires of churches and lofty buildings, as perhaps the quiet time</li>
<li class="L6238" rel="L6238">brought some sense of better things, else forgotten and unattainable,</li>
<li class="L6239" rel="L6239">into his mind. Of late, the neglected bed in the Temple Court had known</li>
<li class="L6240" rel="L6240">him more scantily than ever; and often when he had thrown himself upon</li>
<li class="L6241" rel="L6241">it no longer than a few minutes, he had got up again, and haunted that</li>
<li class="L6242" rel="L6242">neighbourhood.</li>
<li class="L6243" rel="L6243"></li>
<li class="L6244" rel="L6244">On a day in August, when Mr. Stryver (after notifying to his jackal</li>
<li class="L6245" rel="L6245">that “he had thought better of that marrying matter”) had carried his</li>
<li class="L6246" rel="L6246">delicacy into Devonshire, and when the sight and scent of flowers in the</li>
<li class="L6247" rel="L6247">City streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst, of health</li>
<li class="L6248" rel="L6248">for the sickliest, and of youth for the oldest, Sydney&#39;s feet still trod</li>
<li class="L6249" rel="L6249">those stones. From being irresolute and purposeless, his feet became</li>
<li class="L6250" rel="L6250">animated by an intention, and, in the working out of that intention,</li>
<li class="L6251" rel="L6251">they took him to the Doctor&#39;s door.</li>
<li class="L6252" rel="L6252"></li>
<li class="L6253" rel="L6253">He was shown up-stairs, and found Lucie at her work, alone. She had</li>
<li class="L6254" rel="L6254">never been quite at her ease with him, and received him with some little</li>
<li class="L6255" rel="L6255">embarrassment as he seated himself near her table. But, looking up at</li>
<li class="L6256" rel="L6256">his face in the interchange of the first few common-places, she observed</li>
<li class="L6257" rel="L6257">a change in it.</li>
<li class="L6258" rel="L6258"></li>
<li class="L6259" rel="L6259">“I fear you are not well, Mr. Carton!”</li>
<li class="L6260" rel="L6260"></li>
<li class="L6261" rel="L6261">“No. But the life I lead, Miss Manette, is not conducive to health. What</li>
<li class="L6262" rel="L6262">is to be expected of, or by, such profligates?”</li>
<li class="L6263" rel="L6263"></li>
<li class="L6264" rel="L6264">“Is it not--forgive me; I have begun the question on my lips--a pity to</li>
<li class="L6265" rel="L6265">live no better life?”</li>
<li class="L6266" rel="L6266"></li>
<li class="L6267" rel="L6267">“God knows it is a shame!”</li>
<li class="L6268" rel="L6268"></li>
<li class="L6269" rel="L6269">“Then why not change it?”</li>
<li class="L6270" rel="L6270"></li>
<li class="L6271" rel="L6271">Looking gently at him again, she was surprised and saddened to see that</li>
<li class="L6272" rel="L6272">there were tears in his eyes. There were tears in his voice too, as he</li>
<li class="L6273" rel="L6273">answered:</li>
<li class="L6274" rel="L6274"></li>
<li class="L6275" rel="L6275">“It is too late for that. I shall never be better than I am. I shall</li>
<li class="L6276" rel="L6276">sink lower, and be worse.”</li>
<li class="L6277" rel="L6277"></li>
<li class="L6278" rel="L6278">He leaned an elbow on her table, and covered his eyes with his hand. The</li>
<li class="L6279" rel="L6279">table trembled in the silence that followed.</li>
<li class="L6280" rel="L6280"></li>
<li class="L6281" rel="L6281">She had never seen him softened, and was much distressed. He knew her to</li>
<li class="L6282" rel="L6282">be so, without looking at her, and said:</li>
<li class="L6283" rel="L6283"></li>
<li class="L6284" rel="L6284">“Pray forgive me, Miss Manette. I break down before the knowledge of</li>
<li class="L6285" rel="L6285">what I want to say to you. Will you hear me?”</li>
<li class="L6286" rel="L6286"></li>
<li class="L6287" rel="L6287">“If it will do you any good, Mr. Carton, if it would make you happier,</li>
<li class="L6288" rel="L6288">it would make me very glad!”</li>
<li class="L6289" rel="L6289"></li>
<li class="L6290" rel="L6290">“God bless you for your sweet compassion!”</li>
<li class="L6291" rel="L6291"></li>
<li class="L6292" rel="L6292">He unshaded his face after a little while, and spoke steadily.</li>
<li class="L6293" rel="L6293"></li>
<li class="L6294" rel="L6294">“Don&#39;t be afraid to hear me. Don&#39;t shrink from anything I say. I am like</li>
<li class="L6295" rel="L6295">one who died young. All my life might have been.”</li>
<li class="L6296" rel="L6296"></li>
<li class="L6297" rel="L6297">“No, Mr. Carton. I am sure that the best part of it might still be; I am</li>
<li class="L6298" rel="L6298">sure that you might be much, much worthier of yourself.”</li>
<li class="L6299" rel="L6299"></li>
<li class="L6300" rel="L6300">“Say of you, Miss Manette, and although I know better--although in the</li>
<li class="L6301" rel="L6301">mystery of my own wretched heart I know better--I shall never forget</li>
<li class="L6302" rel="L6302">it!”</li>
<li class="L6303" rel="L6303"></li>
<li class="L6304" rel="L6304">She was pale and trembling. He came to her relief with a fixed despair</li>
<li class="L6305" rel="L6305">of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have</li>
<li class="L6306" rel="L6306">been holden.</li>
<li class="L6307" rel="L6307"></li>
<li class="L6308" rel="L6308">“If it had been possible, Miss Manette, that you could have returned the</li>
<li class="L6309" rel="L6309">love of the man you see before yourself--flung away, wasted, drunken,</li>
<li class="L6310" rel="L6310">poor creature of misuse as you know him to be--he would have been</li>
<li class="L6311" rel="L6311">conscious this day and hour, in spite of his happiness, that he would</li>
<li class="L6312" rel="L6312">bring you to misery, bring you to sorrow and repentance, blight you,</li>
<li class="L6313" rel="L6313">disgrace you, pull you down with him. I know very well that you can have</li>
<li class="L6314" rel="L6314">no tenderness for me; I ask for none; I am even thankful that it cannot</li>
<li class="L6315" rel="L6315">be.”</li>
<li class="L6316" rel="L6316"></li>
<li class="L6317" rel="L6317">“Without it, can I not save you, Mr. Carton? Can I not recall</li>
<li class="L6318" rel="L6318">you--forgive me again!--to a better course? Can I in no way repay your</li>
<li class="L6319" rel="L6319">confidence? I know this is a confidence,” she modestly said, after a</li>
<li class="L6320" rel="L6320">little hesitation, and in earnest tears, “I know you would say this to</li>
<li class="L6321" rel="L6321">no one else. Can I turn it to no good account for yourself, Mr. Carton?”</li>
<li class="L6322" rel="L6322"></li>
<li class="L6323" rel="L6323">He shook his head.</li>
<li class="L6324" rel="L6324"></li>
<li class="L6325" rel="L6325">“To none. No, Miss Manette, to none. If you will hear me through a very</li>
<li class="L6326" rel="L6326">little more, all you can ever do for me is done. I wish you to know that</li>
<li class="L6327" rel="L6327">you have been the last dream of my soul. In my degradation I have not</li>
<li class="L6328" rel="L6328">been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father, and of this</li>
<li class="L6329" rel="L6329">home made such a home by you, has stirred old shadows that I thought had</li>
<li class="L6330" rel="L6330">died out of me. Since I knew you, I have been troubled by a remorse that</li>
<li class="L6331" rel="L6331">I thought would never reproach me again, and have heard whispers from</li>
<li class="L6332" rel="L6332">old voices impelling me upward, that I thought were silent for ever. I</li>
<li class="L6333" rel="L6333">have had unformed ideas of striving afresh, beginning anew, shaking off</li>
<li class="L6334" rel="L6334">sloth and sensuality, and fighting out the abandoned fight. A dream, all</li>
<li class="L6335" rel="L6335">a dream, that ends in nothing, and leaves the sleeper where he lay down,</li>
<li class="L6336" rel="L6336">but I wish you to know that you inspired it.”</li>
<li class="L6337" rel="L6337"></li>
<li class="L6338" rel="L6338">“Will nothing of it remain? O Mr. Carton, think again! Try again!”</li>
<li class="L6339" rel="L6339"></li>
<li class="L6340" rel="L6340">“No, Miss Manette; all through it, I have known myself to be quite</li>
<li class="L6341" rel="L6341">undeserving. And yet I have had the weakness, and have still the</li>
<li class="L6342" rel="L6342">weakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me,</li>
<li class="L6343" rel="L6343">heap of ashes that I am, into fire--a fire, however, inseparable in</li>
<li class="L6344" rel="L6344">its nature from myself, quickening nothing, lighting nothing, doing no</li>
<li class="L6345" rel="L6345">service, idly burning away.”</li>
<li class="L6346" rel="L6346"></li>
<li class="L6347" rel="L6347">“Since it is my misfortune, Mr. Carton, to have made you more unhappy</li>
<li class="L6348" rel="L6348">than you were before you knew me--”</li>
<li class="L6349" rel="L6349"></li>
<li class="L6350" rel="L6350">“Don&#39;t say that, Miss Manette, for you would have reclaimed me, if</li>
<li class="L6351" rel="L6351">anything could. You will not be the cause of my becoming worse.”</li>
<li class="L6352" rel="L6352"></li>
<li class="L6353" rel="L6353">“Since the state of your mind that you describe, is, at all events,</li>
<li class="L6354" rel="L6354">attributable to some influence of mine--this is what I mean, if I can</li>
<li class="L6355" rel="L6355">make it plain--can I use no influence to serve you? Have I no power for</li>
<li class="L6356" rel="L6356">good, with you, at all?”</li>
<li class="L6357" rel="L6357"></li>
<li class="L6358" rel="L6358">“The utmost good that I am capable of now, Miss Manette, I have come</li>
<li class="L6359" rel="L6359">here to realise. Let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life,</li>
<li class="L6360" rel="L6360">the remembrance that I opened my heart to you, last of all the world;</li>
<li class="L6361" rel="L6361">and that there was something left in me at this time which you could</li>
<li class="L6362" rel="L6362">deplore and pity.”</li>
<li class="L6363" rel="L6363"></li>
<li class="L6364" rel="L6364">“Which I entreated you to believe, again and again, most fervently, with</li>
<li class="L6365" rel="L6365">all my heart, was capable of better things, Mr. Carton!”</li>
<li class="L6366" rel="L6366"></li>
<li class="L6367" rel="L6367">“Entreat me to believe it no more, Miss Manette. I have proved myself,</li>
<li class="L6368" rel="L6368">and I know better. I distress you; I draw fast to an end. Will you let</li>
<li class="L6369" rel="L6369">me believe, when I recall this day, that the last confidence of my life</li>
<li class="L6370" rel="L6370">was reposed in your pure and innocent breast, and that it lies there</li>
<li class="L6371" rel="L6371">alone, and will be shared by no one?”</li>
<li class="L6372" rel="L6372"></li>
<li class="L6373" rel="L6373">“If that will be a consolation to you, yes.”</li>
<li class="L6374" rel="L6374"></li>
<li class="L6375" rel="L6375">“Not even by the dearest one ever to be known to you?”</li>
<li class="L6376" rel="L6376"></li>
<li class="L6377" rel="L6377">“Mr. Carton,” she answered, after an agitated pause, “the secret is</li>
<li class="L6378" rel="L6378">yours, not mine; and I promise to respect it.”</li>
<li class="L6379" rel="L6379"></li>
<li class="L6380" rel="L6380">“Thank you. And again, God bless you.”</li>
<li class="L6381" rel="L6381"></li>
<li class="L6382" rel="L6382">He put her hand to his lips, and moved towards the door.</li>
<li class="L6383" rel="L6383"></li>
<li class="L6384" rel="L6384">“Be under no apprehension, Miss Manette, of my ever resuming this</li>
<li class="L6385" rel="L6385">conversation by so much as a passing word. I will never refer to it</li>
<li class="L6386" rel="L6386">again. If I were dead, that could not be surer than it is henceforth. In</li>
<li class="L6387" rel="L6387">the hour of my death, I shall hold sacred the one good remembrance--and</li>
<li class="L6388" rel="L6388">shall thank and bless you for it--that my last avowal of myself was made</li>
<li class="L6389" rel="L6389">to you, and that my name, and faults, and miseries were gently carried</li>
<li class="L6390" rel="L6390">in your heart. May it otherwise be light and happy!”</li>
<li class="L6391" rel="L6391"></li>
<li class="L6392" rel="L6392">He was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be, and it was so</li>
<li class="L6393" rel="L6393">sad to think how much he had thrown away, and how much he every day kept</li>
<li class="L6394" rel="L6394">down and perverted, that Lucie Manette wept mournfully for him as he</li>
<li class="L6395" rel="L6395">stood looking back at her.</li>
<li class="L6396" rel="L6396"></li>
<li class="L6397" rel="L6397">“Be comforted!” he said, “I am not worth such feeling, Miss Manette. An</li>
<li class="L6398" rel="L6398">hour or two hence, and the low companions and low habits that I scorn</li>
<li class="L6399" rel="L6399">but yield to, will render me less worth such tears as those, than any</li>
<li class="L6400" rel="L6400">wretch who creeps along the streets. Be comforted! But, within myself, I</li>
<li class="L6401" rel="L6401">shall always be, towards you, what I am now, though outwardly I shall be</li>
<li class="L6402" rel="L6402">what you have heretofore seen me. The last supplication but one I make</li>
<li class="L6403" rel="L6403">to you, is, that you will believe this of me.”</li>
<li class="L6404" rel="L6404"></li>
<li class="L6405" rel="L6405">“I will, Mr. Carton.”</li>
<li class="L6406" rel="L6406"></li>
<li class="L6407" rel="L6407">“My last supplication of all, is this; and with it, I will relieve</li>
<li class="L6408" rel="L6408">you of a visitor with whom I well know you have nothing in unison, and</li>
<li class="L6409" rel="L6409">between whom and you there is an impassable space. It is useless to say</li>
<li class="L6410" rel="L6410">it, I know, but it rises out of my soul. For you, and for any dear to</li>
<li class="L6411" rel="L6411">you, I would do anything. If my career were of that better kind that</li>
<li class="L6412" rel="L6412">there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would</li>
<li class="L6413" rel="L6413">embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you. Try to hold</li>
<li class="L6414" rel="L6414">me in your mind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one</li>
<li class="L6415" rel="L6415">thing. The time will come, the time will not be long in coming, when new</li>
<li class="L6416" rel="L6416">ties will be formed about you--ties that will bind you yet more tenderly</li>
<li class="L6417" rel="L6417">and strongly to the home you so adorn--the dearest ties that will ever</li>
<li class="L6418" rel="L6418">grace and gladden you. O Miss Manette, when the little picture of a</li>
<li class="L6419" rel="L6419">happy father&#39;s face looks up in yours, when you see your own bright</li>
<li class="L6420" rel="L6420">beauty springing up anew at your feet, think now and then that there is</li>
<li class="L6421" rel="L6421">a man who would give his life, to keep a life you love beside you!”</li>
<li class="L6422" rel="L6422"></li>
<li class="L6423" rel="L6423">He said, “Farewell!” said a last “God bless you!” and left her.</li>
<li class="L6424" rel="L6424"></li>
<li class="L6425" rel="L6425"></li>
<li class="L6426" rel="L6426"></li>
<li class="L6427" rel="L6427"></li>
<li class="L6428" rel="L6428">XIV. The Honest Tradesman</li>
<li class="L6429" rel="L6429"></li>
<li class="L6430" rel="L6430"></li>
<li class="L6431" rel="L6431">To the eyes of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher, sitting on his stool in</li>
<li class="L6432" rel="L6432">Fleet-street with his grisly urchin beside him, a vast number and</li>
<li class="L6433" rel="L6433">variety of objects in movement were every day presented. Who could sit</li>
<li class="L6434" rel="L6434">upon anything in Fleet-street during the busy hours of the day, and</li>
<li class="L6435" rel="L6435">not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions, one ever tending</li>
<li class="L6436" rel="L6436">westward with the sun, the other ever tending eastward from the sun,</li>
<li class="L6437" rel="L6437">both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where</li>
<li class="L6438" rel="L6438">the sun goes down!</li>
<li class="L6439" rel="L6439"></li>
<li class="L6440" rel="L6440">With his straw in his mouth, Mr. Cruncher sat watching the two streams,</li>
<li class="L6441" rel="L6441">like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty</li>
<li class="L6442" rel="L6442">watching one stream--saving that Jerry had no expectation of their ever</li>
<li class="L6443" rel="L6443">running dry. Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind,</li>
<li class="L6444" rel="L6444">since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid</li>
<li class="L6445" rel="L6445">women (mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life) from</li>
<li class="L6446" rel="L6446">Tellson&#39;s side of the tides to the opposite shore. Brief as such</li>
<li class="L6447" rel="L6447">companionship was in every separate instance, Mr. Cruncher never failed</li>
<li class="L6448" rel="L6448">to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to</li>
<li class="L6449" rel="L6449">have the honour of drinking her very good health. And it was from</li>
<li class="L6450" rel="L6450">the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent</li>
<li class="L6451" rel="L6451">purpose, that he recruited his finances, as just now observed.</li>
<li class="L6452" rel="L6452"></li>
<li class="L6453" rel="L6453">Time was, when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place, and mused in</li>
<li class="L6454" rel="L6454">the sight of men. Mr. Cruncher, sitting on a stool in a public place,</li>
<li class="L6455" rel="L6455">but not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and looked about him.</li>
<li class="L6456" rel="L6456"></li>
<li class="L6457" rel="L6457">It fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were</li>
<li class="L6458" rel="L6458">few, and belated women few, and when his affairs in general were so</li>
<li class="L6459" rel="L6459">unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs.</li>
<li class="L6460" rel="L6460">Cruncher must have been “flopping” in some pointed manner, when an</li>
<li class="L6461" rel="L6461">unusual concourse pouring down Fleet-street westward, attracted his</li>
<li class="L6462" rel="L6462">attention. Looking that way, Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of</li>
<li class="L6463" rel="L6463">funeral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this</li>
<li class="L6464" rel="L6464">funeral, which engendered uproar.</li>
<li class="L6465" rel="L6465"></li>
<li class="L6466" rel="L6466">“Young Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, turning to his offspring, “it&#39;s a</li>
<li class="L6467" rel="L6467">buryin&#39;.”</li>
<li class="L6468" rel="L6468"></li>
<li class="L6469" rel="L6469">“Hooroar, father!” cried Young Jerry.</li>
<li class="L6470" rel="L6470"></li>
<li class="L6471" rel="L6471">The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious</li>
<li class="L6472" rel="L6472">significance. The elder gentleman took the cry so ill, that he watched</li>
<li class="L6473" rel="L6473">his opportunity, and smote the young gentleman on the ear.</li>
<li class="L6474" rel="L6474"></li>
<li class="L6475" rel="L6475">“What d&#39;ye mean? What are you hooroaring at? What do you want to conwey</li>
<li class="L6476" rel="L6476">to your own father, you young Rip? This boy is a getting too many for</li>
<li class="L6477" rel="L6477">_me_!” said Mr. Cruncher, surveying him. “Him and his hooroars! Don&#39;t</li>
<li class="L6478" rel="L6478">let me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some more of me. D&#39;ye</li>
<li class="L6479" rel="L6479">hear?”</li>
<li class="L6480" rel="L6480"></li>
<li class="L6481" rel="L6481">“I warn&#39;t doing no harm,” Young Jerry protested, rubbing his cheek.</li>
<li class="L6482" rel="L6482"></li>
<li class="L6483" rel="L6483">“Drop it then,” said Mr. Cruncher; “I won&#39;t have none of _your_ no</li>
<li class="L6484" rel="L6484">harms. Get a top of that there seat, and look at the crowd.”</li>
<li class="L6485" rel="L6485"></li>
<li class="L6486" rel="L6486">His son obeyed, and the crowd approached; they were bawling and hissing</li>
<li class="L6487" rel="L6487">round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach, in which mourning coach</li>
<li class="L6488" rel="L6488">there was only one mourner, dressed in the dingy trappings that were</li>
<li class="L6489" rel="L6489">considered essential to the dignity of the position. The position</li>
<li class="L6490" rel="L6490">appeared by no means to please him, however, with an increasing rabble</li>
<li class="L6491" rel="L6491">surrounding the coach, deriding him, making grimaces at him, and</li>
<li class="L6492" rel="L6492">incessantly groaning and calling out: “Yah! Spies! Tst! Yaha! Spies!”</li>
<li class="L6493" rel="L6493"> with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat.</li>
<li class="L6494" rel="L6494"></li>
<li class="L6495" rel="L6495">Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr. Cruncher; he</li>
<li class="L6496" rel="L6496">always pricked up his senses, and became excited, when a funeral passed</li>
<li class="L6497" rel="L6497">Tellson&#39;s. Naturally, therefore, a funeral with this uncommon attendance</li>
<li class="L6498" rel="L6498">excited him greatly, and he asked of the first man who ran against him:</li>
<li class="L6499" rel="L6499"></li>
<li class="L6500" rel="L6500">“What is it, brother? What&#39;s it about?”</li>
<li class="L6501" rel="L6501"></li>
<li class="L6502" rel="L6502">“_I_ don&#39;t know,” said the man. “Spies! Yaha! Tst! Spies!”</li>
<li class="L6503" rel="L6503"></li>
<li class="L6504" rel="L6504">He asked another man. “Who is it?”</li>
<li class="L6505" rel="L6505"></li>
<li class="L6506" rel="L6506">“_I_ don&#39;t know,” returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth</li>
<li class="L6507" rel="L6507">nevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the</li>
<li class="L6508" rel="L6508">greatest ardour, “Spies! Yaha! Tst, tst! Spi--ies!”</li>
<li class="L6509" rel="L6509"></li>
<li class="L6510" rel="L6510">At length, a person better informed on the merits of the case, tumbled</li>
<li class="L6511" rel="L6511">against him, and from this person he learned that the funeral was the</li>
<li class="L6512" rel="L6512">funeral of one Roger Cly.</li>
<li class="L6513" rel="L6513"></li>
<li class="L6514" rel="L6514">“Was he a spy?” asked Mr. Cruncher.</li>
<li class="L6515" rel="L6515"></li>
<li class="L6516" rel="L6516">“Old Bailey spy,” returned his informant. “Yaha! Tst! Yah! Old Bailey</li>
<li class="L6517" rel="L6517">Spi--i--ies!”</li>
<li class="L6518" rel="L6518"></li>
<li class="L6519" rel="L6519">“Why, to be sure!” exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which he had</li>
<li class="L6520" rel="L6520">assisted. “I&#39;ve seen him. Dead, is he?”</li>
<li class="L6521" rel="L6521"></li>
<li class="L6522" rel="L6522">“Dead as mutton,” returned the other, “and can&#39;t be too dead. Have &#39;em</li>
<li class="L6523" rel="L6523">out, there! Spies! Pull &#39;em out, there! Spies!”</li>
<li class="L6524" rel="L6524"></li>
<li class="L6525" rel="L6525">The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea,</li>
<li class="L6526" rel="L6526">that the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the</li>
<li class="L6527" rel="L6527">suggestion to have &#39;em out, and to pull &#39;em out, mobbed the two vehicles</li>
<li class="L6528" rel="L6528">so closely that they came to a stop. On the crowd&#39;s opening the coach</li>
<li class="L6529" rel="L6529">doors, the one mourner scuffled out by himself and was in their hands</li>
<li class="L6530" rel="L6530">for a moment; but he was so alert, and made such good use of his time,</li>
<li class="L6531" rel="L6531">that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye-street, after</li>
<li class="L6532" rel="L6532">shedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchief, and</li>
<li class="L6533" rel="L6533">other symbolical tears.</li>
<li class="L6534" rel="L6534"></li>
<li class="L6535" rel="L6535">These, the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great</li>
<li class="L6536" rel="L6536">enjoyment, while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops; for a</li>
<li class="L6537" rel="L6537">crowd in those times stopped at nothing, and was a monster much dreaded.</li>
<li class="L6538" rel="L6538">They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin</li>
<li class="L6539" rel="L6539">out, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its being escorted to</li>
<li class="L6540" rel="L6540">its destination amidst general rejoicing. Practical suggestions being</li>
<li class="L6541" rel="L6541">much needed, this suggestion, too, was received with acclamation, and</li>
<li class="L6542" rel="L6542">the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out,</li>
<li class="L6543" rel="L6543">while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any</li>
<li class="L6544" rel="L6544">exercise of ingenuity stick upon it. Among the first of these volunteers</li>
<li class="L6545" rel="L6545">was Jerry Cruncher himself, who modestly concealed his spiky head from</li>
<li class="L6546" rel="L6546">the observation of Tellson&#39;s, in the further corner of the mourning</li>
<li class="L6547" rel="L6547">coach.</li>
<li class="L6548" rel="L6548"></li>
<li class="L6549" rel="L6549">The officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in</li>
<li class="L6550" rel="L6550">the ceremonies; but, the river being alarmingly near, and several voices</li>
<li class="L6551" rel="L6551">remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory</li>
<li class="L6552" rel="L6552">members of the profession to reason, the protest was faint and brief.</li>
<li class="L6553" rel="L6553">The remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep driving the</li>
<li class="L6554" rel="L6554">hearse--advised by the regular driver, who was perched beside him, under</li>
<li class="L6555" rel="L6555">close inspection, for the purpose--and with a pieman, also attended</li>
<li class="L6556" rel="L6556">by his cabinet minister, driving the mourning coach. A bear-leader, a</li>
<li class="L6557" rel="L6557">popular street character of the time, was impressed as an additional</li>
<li class="L6558" rel="L6558">ornament, before the cavalcade had gone far down the Strand; and his</li>
<li class="L6559" rel="L6559">bear, who was black and very mangy, gave quite an Undertaking air to</li>
<li class="L6560" rel="L6560">that part of the procession in which he walked.</li>
<li class="L6561" rel="L6561"></li>
<li class="L6562" rel="L6562">Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite</li>
<li class="L6563" rel="L6563">caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting</li>
<li class="L6564" rel="L6564">at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it. Its destination</li>
<li class="L6565" rel="L6565">was the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the fields. It got there</li>
<li class="L6566" rel="L6566">in course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; finally,</li>
<li class="L6567" rel="L6567">accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way, and</li>
<li class="L6568" rel="L6568">highly to its own satisfaction.</li>
<li class="L6569" rel="L6569"></li>
<li class="L6570" rel="L6570">The dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity of</li>
<li class="L6571" rel="L6571">providing some other entertainment for itself, another brighter</li>
<li class="L6572" rel="L6572">genius (or perhaps the same) conceived the humour of impeaching casual</li>
<li class="L6573" rel="L6573">passers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them. Chase</li>
<li class="L6574" rel="L6574">was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near</li>
<li class="L6575" rel="L6575">the Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and</li>
<li class="L6576" rel="L6576">they were roughly hustled and maltreated. The transition to the sport of</li>
<li class="L6577" rel="L6577">window-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was easy</li>
<li class="L6578" rel="L6578">and natural. At last, after several hours, when sundry summer-houses had</li>
<li class="L6579" rel="L6579">been pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up, to arm</li>
<li class="L6580" rel="L6580">the more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the Guards were</li>
<li class="L6581" rel="L6581">coming. Before this rumour, the crowd gradually melted away, and perhaps</li>
<li class="L6582" rel="L6582">the Guards came, and perhaps they never came, and this was the usual</li>
<li class="L6583" rel="L6583">progress of a mob.</li>
<li class="L6584" rel="L6584"></li>
<li class="L6585" rel="L6585">Mr. Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports, but had remained</li>
<li class="L6586" rel="L6586">behind in the churchyard, to confer and condole with the undertakers.</li>
<li class="L6587" rel="L6587">The place had a soothing influence on him. He procured a pipe from a</li>
<li class="L6588" rel="L6588">neighbouring public-house, and smoked it, looking in at the railings and</li>
<li class="L6589" rel="L6589">maturely considering the spot.</li>
<li class="L6590" rel="L6590"></li>
<li class="L6591" rel="L6591">“Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, apostrophising himself in his usual way,</li>
<li class="L6592" rel="L6592">“you see that there Cly that day, and you see with your own eyes that he</li>
<li class="L6593" rel="L6593">was a young &#39;un and a straight made &#39;un.”</li>
<li class="L6594" rel="L6594"></li>
<li class="L6595" rel="L6595">Having smoked his pipe out, and ruminated a little longer, he turned</li>
<li class="L6596" rel="L6596">himself about, that he might appear, before the hour of closing, on his</li>
<li class="L6597" rel="L6597">station at Tellson&#39;s. Whether his meditations on mortality had touched</li>
<li class="L6598" rel="L6598">his liver, or whether his general health had been previously at all</li>
<li class="L6599" rel="L6599">amiss, or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent</li>
<li class="L6600" rel="L6600">man, is not so much to the purpose, as that he made a short call upon</li>
<li class="L6601" rel="L6601">his medical adviser--a distinguished surgeon--on his way back.</li>
<li class="L6602" rel="L6602"></li>
<li class="L6603" rel="L6603">Young Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest, and reported No</li>
<li class="L6604" rel="L6604">job in his absence. The bank closed, the ancient clerks came out, the</li>
<li class="L6605" rel="L6605">usual watch was set, and Mr. Cruncher and his son went home to tea.</li>
<li class="L6606" rel="L6606"></li>
<li class="L6607" rel="L6607">“Now, I tell you where it is!” said Mr. Cruncher to his wife, on</li>
<li class="L6608" rel="L6608">entering. “If, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs goes wrong to-night, I</li>
<li class="L6609" rel="L6609">shall make sure that you&#39;ve been praying again me, and I shall work you</li>
<li class="L6610" rel="L6610">for it just the same as if I seen you do it.”</li>
<li class="L6611" rel="L6611"></li>
<li class="L6612" rel="L6612">The dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her head.</li>
<li class="L6613" rel="L6613"></li>
<li class="L6614" rel="L6614">“Why, you&#39;re at it afore my face!” said Mr. Cruncher, with signs of</li>
<li class="L6615" rel="L6615">angry apprehension.</li>
<li class="L6616" rel="L6616"></li>
<li class="L6617" rel="L6617">“I am saying nothing.”</li>
<li class="L6618" rel="L6618"></li>
<li class="L6619" rel="L6619">“Well, then; don&#39;t meditate nothing. You might as well flop as meditate.</li>
<li class="L6620" rel="L6620">You may as well go again me one way as another. Drop it altogether.”</li>
<li class="L6621" rel="L6621"></li>
<li class="L6622" rel="L6622">“Yes, Jerry.”</li>
<li class="L6623" rel="L6623"></li>
<li class="L6624" rel="L6624">“Yes, Jerry,” repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea. “Ah! It _is_</li>
<li class="L6625" rel="L6625">yes, Jerry. That&#39;s about it. You may say yes, Jerry.”</li>
<li class="L6626" rel="L6626"></li>
<li class="L6627" rel="L6627">Mr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations,</li>
<li class="L6628" rel="L6628">but made use of them, as people not unfrequently do, to express general</li>
<li class="L6629" rel="L6629">ironical dissatisfaction.</li>
<li class="L6630" rel="L6630"></li>
<li class="L6631" rel="L6631">“You and your yes, Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of his</li>
<li class="L6632" rel="L6632">bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large invisible</li>
<li class="L6633" rel="L6633">oyster out of his saucer. “Ah! I think so. I believe you.”</li>
<li class="L6634" rel="L6634"></li>
<li class="L6635" rel="L6635">“You are going out to-night?” asked his decent wife, when he took</li>
<li class="L6636" rel="L6636">another bite.</li>
<li class="L6637" rel="L6637"></li>
<li class="L6638" rel="L6638">“Yes, I am.”</li>
<li class="L6639" rel="L6639"></li>
<li class="L6640" rel="L6640">“May I go with you, father?” asked his son, briskly.</li>
<li class="L6641" rel="L6641"></li>
<li class="L6642" rel="L6642">“No, you mayn&#39;t. I&#39;m a going--as your mother knows--a fishing. That&#39;s</li>
<li class="L6643" rel="L6643">where I&#39;m going to. Going a fishing.”</li>
<li class="L6644" rel="L6644"></li>
<li class="L6645" rel="L6645">“Your fishing-rod gets rayther rusty; don&#39;t it, father?”</li>
<li class="L6646" rel="L6646"></li>
<li class="L6647" rel="L6647">“Never you mind.”</li>
<li class="L6648" rel="L6648"></li>
<li class="L6649" rel="L6649">“Shall you bring any fish home, father?”</li>
<li class="L6650" rel="L6650"></li>
<li class="L6651" rel="L6651">“If I don&#39;t, you&#39;ll have short commons, to-morrow,” returned that</li>
<li class="L6652" rel="L6652">gentleman, shaking his head; “that&#39;s questions enough for you; I ain&#39;t a</li>
<li class="L6653" rel="L6653">going out, till you&#39;ve been long abed.”</li>
<li class="L6654" rel="L6654"></li>
<li class="L6655" rel="L6655">He devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a</li>
<li class="L6656" rel="L6656">most vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher, and sullenly holding her in</li>
<li class="L6657" rel="L6657">conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions</li>
<li class="L6658" rel="L6658">to his disadvantage. With this view, he urged his son to hold her in</li>
<li class="L6659" rel="L6659">conversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling</li>
<li class="L6660" rel="L6660">on any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather than</li>
<li class="L6661" rel="L6661">he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections. The devoutest</li>
<li class="L6662" rel="L6662">person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an</li>
<li class="L6663" rel="L6663">honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife. It was as if a</li>
<li class="L6664" rel="L6664">professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story.</li>
<li class="L6665" rel="L6665"></li>
<li class="L6666" rel="L6666">“And mind you!” said Mr. Cruncher. “No games to-morrow! If I, as a</li>
<li class="L6667" rel="L6667">honest tradesman, succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two, none</li>
<li class="L6668" rel="L6668">of your not touching of it, and sticking to bread. If I, as a honest</li>
<li class="L6669" rel="L6669">tradesman, am able to provide a little beer, none of your declaring</li>
<li class="L6670" rel="L6670">on water. When you go to Rome, do as Rome does. Rome will be a ugly</li>
<li class="L6671" rel="L6671">customer to you, if you don&#39;t. _I_&#39;m your Rome, you know.”</li>
<li class="L6672" rel="L6672"></li>
<li class="L6673" rel="L6673">Then he began grumbling again:</li>
<li class="L6674" rel="L6674"></li>
<li class="L6675" rel="L6675">“With your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink! I don&#39;t</li>
<li class="L6676" rel="L6676">know how scarce you mayn&#39;t make the wittles and drink here, by your</li>
<li class="L6677" rel="L6677">flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct. Look at your boy: he _is_</li>
<li class="L6678" rel="L6678">your&#39;n, ain&#39;t he? He&#39;s as thin as a lath. Do you call yourself a mother,</li>
<li class="L6679" rel="L6679">and not know that a mother&#39;s first duty is to blow her boy out?”</li>
<li class="L6680" rel="L6680"></li>
<li class="L6681" rel="L6681">This touched Young Jerry on a tender place; who adjured his mother to</li>
<li class="L6682" rel="L6682">perform her first duty, and, whatever else she did or neglected, above</li>
<li class="L6683" rel="L6683">all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal</li>
<li class="L6684" rel="L6684">function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent.</li>
<li class="L6685" rel="L6685"></li>
<li class="L6686" rel="L6686">Thus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family, until Young Jerry</li>
<li class="L6687" rel="L6687">was ordered to bed, and his mother, laid under similar injunctions,</li>
<li class="L6688" rel="L6688">obeyed them. Mr. Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with</li>
<li class="L6689" rel="L6689">solitary pipes, and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one</li>
<li class="L6690" rel="L6690">o&#39;clock. Towards that small and ghostly hour, he rose up from his chair,</li>
<li class="L6691" rel="L6691">took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and brought</li>
<li class="L6692" rel="L6692">forth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a rope and chain, and other</li>
<li class="L6693" rel="L6693">fishing tackle of that nature. Disposing these articles about him</li>
<li class="L6694" rel="L6694">in skilful manner, he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs. Cruncher,</li>
<li class="L6695" rel="L6695">extinguished the light, and went out.</li>
<li class="L6696" rel="L6696"></li>
<li class="L6697" rel="L6697">Young Jerry, who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to</li>
<li class="L6698" rel="L6698">bed, was not long after his father. Under cover of the darkness he</li>
<li class="L6699" rel="L6699">followed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down the</li>
<li class="L6700" rel="L6700">court, followed out into the streets. He was in no uneasiness concerning</li>
<li class="L6701" rel="L6701">his getting into the house again, for it was full of lodgers, and the</li>
<li class="L6702" rel="L6702">door stood ajar all night.</li>
<li class="L6703" rel="L6703"></li>
<li class="L6704" rel="L6704">Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his</li>
<li class="L6705" rel="L6705">father&#39;s honest calling, Young Jerry, keeping as close to house fronts,</li>
<li class="L6706" rel="L6706">walls, and doorways, as his eyes were close to one another, held his</li>
<li class="L6707" rel="L6707">honoured parent in view. The honoured parent steering Northward, had not</li>
<li class="L6708" rel="L6708">gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton, and</li>
<li class="L6709" rel="L6709">the two trudged on together.</li>
<li class="L6710" rel="L6710"></li>
<li class="L6711" rel="L6711">Within half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond the</li>
<li class="L6712" rel="L6712">winking lamps, and the more than winking watchmen, and were out upon a</li>
<li class="L6713" rel="L6713">lonely road. Another fisherman was picked up here--and that so silently,</li>
<li class="L6714" rel="L6714">that if Young Jerry had been superstitious, he might have supposed the</li>
<li class="L6715" rel="L6715">second follower of the gentle craft to have, all of a sudden, split</li>
<li class="L6716" rel="L6716">himself into two.</li>
<li class="L6717" rel="L6717"></li>
<li class="L6718" rel="L6718">The three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped</li>
<li class="L6719" rel="L6719">under a bank overhanging the road. Upon the top of the bank was a low</li>
<li class="L6720" rel="L6720">brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing. In the shadow of bank and</li>
<li class="L6721" rel="L6721">wall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of which</li>
<li class="L6722" rel="L6722">the wall--there, risen to some eight or ten feet high--formed one side.</li>
<li class="L6723" rel="L6723">Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that</li>
<li class="L6724" rel="L6724">Young Jerry saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well</li>
<li class="L6725" rel="L6725">defined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate.</li>
<li class="L6726" rel="L6726">He was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the</li>
<li class="L6727" rel="L6727">third. They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay</li>
<li class="L6728" rel="L6728">there a little--listening perhaps. Then, they moved away on their hands</li>
<li class="L6729" rel="L6729">and knees.</li>
<li class="L6730" rel="L6730"></li>
<li class="L6731" rel="L6731">It was now Young Jerry&#39;s turn to approach the gate: which he did,</li>
<li class="L6732" rel="L6732">holding his breath. Crouching down again in a corner there, and looking</li>
<li class="L6733" rel="L6733">in, he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass!</li>
<li class="L6734" rel="L6734">and all the gravestones in the churchyard--it was a large churchyard</li>
<li class="L6735" rel="L6735">that they were in--looking on like ghosts in white, while the church</li>
<li class="L6736" rel="L6736">tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant. They did not</li>
<li class="L6737" rel="L6737">creep far, before they stopped and stood upright. And then they began to</li>
<li class="L6738" rel="L6738">fish.</li>
<li class="L6739" rel="L6739"></li>
<li class="L6740" rel="L6740">They fished with a spade, at first. Presently the honoured parent</li>
<li class="L6741" rel="L6741">appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew.</li>
<li class="L6742" rel="L6742">Whatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful</li>
<li class="L6743" rel="L6743">striking of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry, that he made off,</li>
<li class="L6744" rel="L6744">with his hair as stiff as his father&#39;s.</li>
<li class="L6745" rel="L6745"></li>
<li class="L6746" rel="L6746">But, his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters, not</li>
<li class="L6747" rel="L6747">only stopped him in his running away, but lured him back again. They</li>
<li class="L6748" rel="L6748">were still fishing perseveringly, when he peeped in at the gate for</li>
<li class="L6749" rel="L6749">the second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite. There was a</li>
<li class="L6750" rel="L6750">screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures were</li>
<li class="L6751" rel="L6751">strained, as if by a weight. By slow degrees the weight broke away the</li>
<li class="L6752" rel="L6752">earth upon it, and came to the surface. Young Jerry very well knew what</li>
<li class="L6753" rel="L6753">it would be; but, when he saw it, and saw his honoured parent about to</li>
<li class="L6754" rel="L6754">wrench it open, he was so frightened, being new to the sight, that he</li>
<li class="L6755" rel="L6755">made off again, and never stopped until he had run a mile or more.</li>
<li class="L6756" rel="L6756"></li>
<li class="L6757" rel="L6757">He would not have stopped then, for anything less necessary than breath,</li>
<li class="L6758" rel="L6758">it being a spectral sort of race that he ran, and one highly desirable</li>
<li class="L6759" rel="L6759">to get to the end of. He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen</li>
<li class="L6760" rel="L6760">was running after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt</li>
<li class="L6761" rel="L6761">upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him</li>
<li class="L6762" rel="L6762">and hopping on at his side--perhaps taking his arm--it was a pursuer to</li>
<li class="L6763" rel="L6763">shun. It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it</li>
<li class="L6764" rel="L6764">was making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the</li>
<li class="L6765" rel="L6765">roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them</li>
<li class="L6766" rel="L6766">like a dropsical boy&#39;s kite without tail and wings. It hid in doorways</li>
<li class="L6767" rel="L6767">too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up</li>
<li class="L6768" rel="L6768">to its ears, as if it were laughing. It got into shadows on the road,</li>
<li class="L6769" rel="L6769">and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up. All this time it was</li>
<li class="L6770" rel="L6770">incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy</li>
<li class="L6771" rel="L6771">got to his own door he had reason for being half dead. And even then</li>
<li class="L6772" rel="L6772">it would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every</li>
<li class="L6773" rel="L6773">stair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on</li>
<li class="L6774" rel="L6774">his breast when he fell asleep.</li>
<li class="L6775" rel="L6775"></li>
<li class="L6776" rel="L6776">From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after</li>
<li class="L6777" rel="L6777">daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the</li>
<li class="L6778" rel="L6778">family room. Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young Jerry</li>
<li class="L6779" rel="L6779">inferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by the</li>
<li class="L6780" rel="L6780">ears, and knocking the back of her head against the head-board of the</li>
<li class="L6781" rel="L6781">bed.</li>
<li class="L6782" rel="L6782"></li>
<li class="L6783" rel="L6783">“I told you I would,” said Mr. Cruncher, “and I did.”</li>
<li class="L6784" rel="L6784"></li>
<li class="L6785" rel="L6785">“Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!” his wife implored.</li>
<li class="L6786" rel="L6786"></li>
<li class="L6787" rel="L6787">“You oppose yourself to the profit of the business,” said Jerry, “and me</li>
<li class="L6788" rel="L6788">and my partners suffer. You was to honour and obey; why the devil don&#39;t</li>
<li class="L6789" rel="L6789">you?”</li>
<li class="L6790" rel="L6790"></li>
<li class="L6791" rel="L6791">“I try to be a good wife, Jerry,” the poor woman protested, with tears.</li>
<li class="L6792" rel="L6792"></li>
<li class="L6793" rel="L6793">“Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband&#39;s business? Is it</li>
<li class="L6794" rel="L6794">honouring your husband to dishonour his business? Is it obeying your</li>
<li class="L6795" rel="L6795">husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?”</li>
<li class="L6796" rel="L6796"></li>
<li class="L6797" rel="L6797">“You hadn&#39;t taken to the dreadful business then, Jerry.”</li>
<li class="L6798" rel="L6798"></li>
<li class="L6799" rel="L6799">“It&#39;s enough for you,” retorted Mr. Cruncher, “to be the wife of a</li>
<li class="L6800" rel="L6800">honest tradesman, and not to occupy your female mind with calculations</li>
<li class="L6801" rel="L6801">when he took to his trade or when he didn&#39;t. A honouring and obeying</li>
<li class="L6802" rel="L6802">wife would let his trade alone altogether. Call yourself a religious</li>
<li class="L6803" rel="L6803">woman? If you&#39;re a religious woman, give me a irreligious one! You have</li>
<li class="L6804" rel="L6804">no more nat&#39;ral sense of duty than the bed of this here Thames river has</li>
<li class="L6805" rel="L6805">of a pile, and similarly it must be knocked into you.”</li>
<li class="L6806" rel="L6806"></li>
<li class="L6807" rel="L6807">The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice, and terminated in</li>
<li class="L6808" rel="L6808">the honest tradesman&#39;s kicking off his clay-soiled boots, and lying down</li>
<li class="L6809" rel="L6809">at his length on the floor. After taking a timid peep at him lying on</li>
<li class="L6810" rel="L6810">his back, with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow, his son lay</li>
<li class="L6811" rel="L6811">down too, and fell asleep again.</li>
<li class="L6812" rel="L6812"></li>
<li class="L6813" rel="L6813">There was no fish for breakfast, and not much of anything else. Mr.</li>
<li class="L6814" rel="L6814">Cruncher was out of spirits, and out of temper, and kept an iron pot-lid</li>
<li class="L6815" rel="L6815">by him as a projectile for the correction of Mrs. Cruncher, in case</li>
<li class="L6816" rel="L6816">he should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace. He was brushed</li>
<li class="L6817" rel="L6817">and washed at the usual hour, and set off with his son to pursue his</li>
<li class="L6818" rel="L6818">ostensible calling.</li>
<li class="L6819" rel="L6819"></li>
<li class="L6820" rel="L6820">Young Jerry, walking with the stool under his arm at his father&#39;s side</li>
<li class="L6821" rel="L6821">along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different Young Jerry</li>
<li class="L6822" rel="L6822">from him of the previous night, running home through darkness and</li>
<li class="L6823" rel="L6823">solitude from his grim pursuer. His cunning was fresh with the day,</li>
<li class="L6824" rel="L6824">and his qualms were gone with the night--in which particulars it is not</li>
<li class="L6825" rel="L6825">improbable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London,</li>
<li class="L6826" rel="L6826">that fine morning.</li>
<li class="L6827" rel="L6827"></li>
<li class="L6828" rel="L6828">“Father,” said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to keep</li>
<li class="L6829" rel="L6829">at arm&#39;s length and to have the stool well between them: “what&#39;s a</li>
<li class="L6830" rel="L6830">Resurrection-Man?”</li>
<li class="L6831" rel="L6831"></li>
<li class="L6832" rel="L6832">Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered, “How</li>
<li class="L6833" rel="L6833">should I know?”</li>
<li class="L6834" rel="L6834"></li>
<li class="L6835" rel="L6835">“I thought you knowed everything, father,” said the artless boy.</li>
<li class="L6836" rel="L6836"></li>
<li class="L6837" rel="L6837">“Hem! Well,” returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting off his</li>
<li class="L6838" rel="L6838">hat to give his spikes free play, “he&#39;s a tradesman.”</li>
<li class="L6839" rel="L6839"></li>
<li class="L6840" rel="L6840">“What&#39;s his goods, father?” asked the brisk Young Jerry.</li>
<li class="L6841" rel="L6841"></li>
<li class="L6842" rel="L6842">“His goods,” said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his mind, “is a</li>
<li class="L6843" rel="L6843">branch of Scientific goods.”</li>
<li class="L6844" rel="L6844"></li>
<li class="L6845" rel="L6845">“Persons&#39; bodies, ain&#39;t it, father?” asked the lively boy.</li>
<li class="L6846" rel="L6846"></li>
<li class="L6847" rel="L6847">“I believe it is something of that sort,” said Mr. Cruncher.</li>
<li class="L6848" rel="L6848"></li>
<li class="L6849" rel="L6849">“Oh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I&#39;m quite</li>
<li class="L6850" rel="L6850">growed up!”</li>
<li class="L6851" rel="L6851"></li>
<li class="L6852" rel="L6852">Mr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and moral way.</li>
<li class="L6853" rel="L6853">“It depends upon how you dewelop your talents. Be careful to dewelop</li>
<li class="L6854" rel="L6854">your talents, and never to say no more than you can help to nobody, and</li>
<li class="L6855" rel="L6855">there&#39;s no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit</li>
<li class="L6856" rel="L6856">for.” As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a few yards in advance,</li>
<li class="L6857" rel="L6857">to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr. Cruncher added to</li>
<li class="L6858" rel="L6858">himself: “Jerry, you honest tradesman, there&#39;s hopes wot that boy will</li>
<li class="L6859" rel="L6859">yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for his mother!”</li>
<li class="L6860" rel="L6860"></li>
<li class="L6861" rel="L6861"></li>
<li class="L6862" rel="L6862"></li>
<li class="L6863" rel="L6863"></li>
<li class="L6864" rel="L6864">XV. Knitting</li>
<li class="L6865" rel="L6865"></li>
<li class="L6866" rel="L6866"></li>
<li class="L6867" rel="L6867">There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur</li>
<li class="L6868" rel="L6868">Defarge. As early as six o&#39;clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping</li>
<li class="L6869" rel="L6869">through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over</li>
<li class="L6870" rel="L6870">measures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best</li>
<li class="L6871" rel="L6871">of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that</li>
<li class="L6872" rel="L6872">he sold at this time. A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its</li>
<li class="L6873" rel="L6873">influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy. No</li>
<li class="L6874" rel="L6874">vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur</li>
<li class="L6875" rel="L6875">Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in</li>
<li class="L6876" rel="L6876">the dregs of it.</li>
<li class="L6877" rel="L6877"></li>
<li class="L6878" rel="L6878">This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been</li>
<li class="L6879" rel="L6879">early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. It had begun</li>
<li class="L6880" rel="L6880">on Monday, and here was Wednesday come. There had been more of early</li>
<li class="L6881" rel="L6881">brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and</li>
<li class="L6882" rel="L6882">slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who could</li>
<li class="L6883" rel="L6883">not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls. These</li>
<li class="L6884" rel="L6884">were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could</li>
<li class="L6885" rel="L6885">have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat,</li>
<li class="L6886" rel="L6886">and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with greedy</li>
<li class="L6887" rel="L6887">looks.</li>
<li class="L6888" rel="L6888"></li>
<li class="L6889" rel="L6889">Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company, the master of the wine-shop</li>
<li class="L6890" rel="L6890">was not visible. He was not missed; for, nobody who crossed the</li>
<li class="L6891" rel="L6891">threshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered to see</li>
<li class="L6892" rel="L6892">only Madame Defarge in her seat, presiding over the distribution of</li>
<li class="L6893" rel="L6893">wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much defaced</li>
<li class="L6894" rel="L6894">and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of</li>
<li class="L6895" rel="L6895">humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come.</li>
<li class="L6896" rel="L6896"></li>
<li class="L6897" rel="L6897">A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps</li>
<li class="L6898" rel="L6898">observed by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop, as they looked in</li>
<li class="L6899" rel="L6899">at every place, high and low, from the king&#39;s palace to the criminal&#39;s</li>
<li class="L6900" rel="L6900">gaol. Games at cards languished, players at dominoes musingly built</li>
<li class="L6901" rel="L6901">towers with them, drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops</li>
<li class="L6902" rel="L6902">of wine, Madame Defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve</li>
<li class="L6903" rel="L6903">with her toothpick, and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible</li>
<li class="L6904" rel="L6904">a long way off.</li>
<li class="L6905" rel="L6905"></li>
<li class="L6906" rel="L6906">Thus, Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his, until midday. It was</li>
<li class="L6907" rel="L6907">high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his streets and under</li>
<li class="L6908" rel="L6908">his swinging lamps: of whom, one was Monsieur Defarge: the other a</li>
<li class="L6909" rel="L6909">mender of roads in a blue cap. All adust and athirst, the two entered</li>
<li class="L6910" rel="L6910">the wine-shop. Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast</li>
<li class="L6911" rel="L6911">of Saint Antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which stirred and</li>
<li class="L6912" rel="L6912">flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows. Yet, no one had</li>
<li class="L6913" rel="L6913">followed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop, though</li>
<li class="L6914" rel="L6914">the eyes of every man there were turned upon them.</li>
<li class="L6915" rel="L6915"></li>
<li class="L6916" rel="L6916">“Good day, gentlemen!” said Monsieur Defarge.</li>
<li class="L6917" rel="L6917"></li>
<li class="L6918" rel="L6918">It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue. It elicited</li>
<li class="L6919" rel="L6919">an answering chorus of “Good day!”</li>
<li class="L6920" rel="L6920"></li>
<li class="L6921" rel="L6921">“It is bad weather, gentlemen,” said Defarge, shaking his head.</li>
<li class="L6922" rel="L6922"></li>
<li class="L6923" rel="L6923">Upon which, every man looked at his neighbour, and then all cast down</li>
<li class="L6924" rel="L6924">their eyes and sat silent. Except one man, who got up and went out.</li>
<li class="L6925" rel="L6925"></li>
<li class="L6926" rel="L6926">“My wife,” said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge: “I have</li>
<li class="L6927" rel="L6927">travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called</li>
<li class="L6928" rel="L6928">Jacques. I met him--by accident--a day and half&#39;s journey out of Paris.</li>
<li class="L6929" rel="L6929">He is a good child, this mender of roads, called Jacques. Give him to</li>
<li class="L6930" rel="L6930">drink, my wife!”</li>
<li class="L6931" rel="L6931"></li>
<li class="L6932" rel="L6932">A second man got up and went out. Madame Defarge set wine before the</li>
<li class="L6933" rel="L6933">mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his blue cap to the company,</li>
<li class="L6934" rel="L6934">and drank. In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark</li>
<li class="L6935" rel="L6935">bread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and drinking near</li>
<li class="L6936" rel="L6936">Madame Defarge&#39;s counter. A third man got up and went out.</li>
<li class="L6937" rel="L6937"></li>
<li class="L6938" rel="L6938">Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine--but, he took less</li>
<li class="L6939" rel="L6939">than was given to the stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no</li>
<li class="L6940" rel="L6940">rarity--and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast.</li>
<li class="L6941" rel="L6941">He looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him; not even</li>
<li class="L6942" rel="L6942">Madame Defarge, who had taken up her knitting, and was at work.</li>
<li class="L6943" rel="L6943"></li>
<li class="L6944" rel="L6944">“Have you finished your repast, friend?” he asked, in due season.</li>
<li class="L6945" rel="L6945"></li>
<li class="L6946" rel="L6946">“Yes, thank you.”</li>
<li class="L6947" rel="L6947"></li>
<li class="L6948" rel="L6948">“Come, then! You shall see the apartment that I told you you could</li>
<li class="L6949" rel="L6949">occupy. It will suit you to a marvel.”</li>
<li class="L6950" rel="L6950"></li>
<li class="L6951" rel="L6951">Out of the wine-shop into the street, out of the street into a</li>
<li class="L6952" rel="L6952">courtyard, out of the courtyard up a steep staircase, out of the</li>
<li class="L6953" rel="L6953">staircase into a garret--formerly the garret where a white-haired man</li>
<li class="L6954" rel="L6954">sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.</li>
<li class="L6955" rel="L6955"></li>
<li class="L6956" rel="L6956">No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there who had</li>
<li class="L6957" rel="L6957">gone out of the wine-shop singly. And between them and the white-haired</li>
<li class="L6958" rel="L6958">man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at</li>
<li class="L6959" rel="L6959">him through the chinks in the wall.</li>
<li class="L6960" rel="L6960"></li>
<li class="L6961" rel="L6961">Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice:</li>
<li class="L6962" rel="L6962"></li>
<li class="L6963" rel="L6963">“Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness</li>
<li class="L6964" rel="L6964">encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four. He will tell you all.</li>
<li class="L6965" rel="L6965">Speak, Jacques Five!”</li>
<li class="L6966" rel="L6966"></li>
<li class="L6967" rel="L6967">The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead with</li>
<li class="L6968" rel="L6968">it, and said, “Where shall I commence, monsieur?”</li>
<li class="L6969" rel="L6969"></li>
<li class="L6970" rel="L6970">“Commence,” was Monsieur Defarge&#39;s not unreasonable reply, “at the</li>
<li class="L6971" rel="L6971">commencement.”</li>
<li class="L6972" rel="L6972"></li>
<li class="L6973" rel="L6973">“I saw him then, messieurs,” began the mender of roads, “a year ago this</li>
<li class="L6974" rel="L6974">running summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging by the</li>
<li class="L6975" rel="L6975">chain. Behold the manner of it. I leaving my work on the road, the sun</li>
<li class="L6976" rel="L6976">going to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the hill, he</li>
<li class="L6977" rel="L6977">hanging by the chain--like this.”</li>
<li class="L6978" rel="L6978"></li>
<li class="L6979" rel="L6979">Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which</li>
<li class="L6980" rel="L6980">he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been</li>
<li class="L6981" rel="L6981">the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village</li>
<li class="L6982" rel="L6982">during a whole year.</li>
<li class="L6983" rel="L6983"></li>
<li class="L6984" rel="L6984">Jacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen the man before?</li>
<li class="L6985" rel="L6985"></li>
<li class="L6986" rel="L6986">“Never,” answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular.</li>
<li class="L6987" rel="L6987"></li>
<li class="L6988" rel="L6988">Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then?</li>
<li class="L6989" rel="L6989"></li>
<li class="L6990" rel="L6990">“By his tall figure,” said the mender of roads, softly, and with his</li>
<li class="L6991" rel="L6991">finger at his nose. “When Monsieur the Marquis demands that evening,</li>
<li class="L6992" rel="L6992">&#39;Say, what is he like?&#39; I make response, &#39;Tall as a spectre.&#39;”</li>
<li class="L6993" rel="L6993"></li>
<li class="L6994" rel="L6994">“You should have said, short as a dwarf,” returned Jacques Two.</li>
<li class="L6995" rel="L6995"></li>
<li class="L6996" rel="L6996">“But what did I know? The deed was not then accomplished, neither did he</li>
<li class="L6997" rel="L6997">confide in me. Observe! Under those circumstances even, I do not</li>
<li class="L6998" rel="L6998">offer my testimony. Monsieur the Marquis indicates me with his finger,</li>
<li class="L6999" rel="L6999">standing near our little fountain, and says, &#39;To me! Bring that rascal!&#39;</li>
<li class="L7000" rel="L7000">My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing.”</li>
<li class="L7001" rel="L7001"></li>
<li class="L7002" rel="L7002">“He is right there, Jacques,” murmured Defarge, to him who had</li>
<li class="L7003" rel="L7003">interrupted. “Go on!”</li>
<li class="L7004" rel="L7004"></li>
<li class="L7005" rel="L7005">“Good!” said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery. “The tall man</li>
<li class="L7006" rel="L7006">is lost, and he is sought--how many months? Nine, ten, eleven?”</li>
<li class="L7007" rel="L7007"></li>
<li class="L7008" rel="L7008">“No matter, the number,” said Defarge. “He is well hidden, but at last</li>
<li class="L7009" rel="L7009">he is unluckily found. Go on!”</li>
<li class="L7010" rel="L7010"></li>
<li class="L7011" rel="L7011">“I am again at work upon the hill-side, and the sun is again about to</li>
<li class="L7012" rel="L7012">go to bed. I am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in the</li>
<li class="L7013" rel="L7013">village below, where it is already dark, when I raise my eyes, and see</li>
<li class="L7014" rel="L7014">coming over the hill six soldiers. In the midst of them is a tall man</li>
<li class="L7015" rel="L7015">with his arms bound--tied to his sides--like this!”</li>
<li class="L7016" rel="L7016"></li>
<li class="L7017" rel="L7017">With the aid of his indispensable cap, he represented a man with his</li>
<li class="L7018" rel="L7018">elbows bound fast at his hips, with cords that were knotted behind him.</li>
<li class="L7019" rel="L7019"></li>
<li class="L7020" rel="L7020">“I stand aside, messieurs, by my heap of stones, to see the soldiers</li>
<li class="L7021" rel="L7021">and their prisoner pass (for it is a solitary road, that, where any</li>
<li class="L7022" rel="L7022">spectacle is well worth looking at), and at first, as they approach, I</li>
<li class="L7023" rel="L7023">see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound, and</li>
<li class="L7024" rel="L7024">that they are almost black to my sight--except on the side of the sun</li>
<li class="L7025" rel="L7025">going to bed, where they have a red edge, messieurs. Also, I see that</li>
<li class="L7026" rel="L7026">their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the</li>
<li class="L7027" rel="L7027">road, and are on the hill above it, and are like the shadows of giants.</li>
<li class="L7028" rel="L7028">Also, I see that they are covered with dust, and that the dust moves</li>
<li class="L7029" rel="L7029">with them as they come, tramp, tramp! But when they advance quite near</li>
<li class="L7030" rel="L7030">to me, I recognise the tall man, and he recognises me. Ah, but he would</li>
<li class="L7031" rel="L7031">be well content to precipitate himself over the hill-side once again, as</li>
<li class="L7032" rel="L7032">on the evening when he and I first encountered, close to the same spot!”</li>
<li class="L7033" rel="L7033"></li>
<li class="L7034" rel="L7034">He described it as if he were there, and it was evident that he saw it</li>
<li class="L7035" rel="L7035">vividly; perhaps he had not seen much in his life.</li>
<li class="L7036" rel="L7036"></li>
<li class="L7037" rel="L7037">“I do not show the soldiers that I recognise the tall man; he does not</li>
<li class="L7038" rel="L7038">show the soldiers that he recognises me; we do it, and we know it, with</li>
<li class="L7039" rel="L7039">our eyes. &#39;Come on!&#39; says the chief of that company, pointing to the</li>
<li class="L7040" rel="L7040">village, &#39;bring him fast to his tomb!&#39; and they bring him faster. I</li>
<li class="L7041" rel="L7041">follow. His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight, his wooden</li>
<li class="L7042" rel="L7042">shoes are large and clumsy, and he is lame. Because he is lame, and</li>
<li class="L7043" rel="L7043">consequently slow, they drive him with their guns--like this!”</li>
<li class="L7044" rel="L7044"></li>
<li class="L7045" rel="L7045">He imitated the action of a man&#39;s being impelled forward by the</li>
<li class="L7046" rel="L7046">butt-ends of muskets.</li>
<li class="L7047" rel="L7047"></li>
<li class="L7048" rel="L7048">“As they descend the hill like madmen running a race, he falls. They</li>
<li class="L7049" rel="L7049">laugh and pick him up again. His face is bleeding and covered with dust,</li>
<li class="L7050" rel="L7050">but he cannot touch it; thereupon they laugh again. They bring him into</li>
<li class="L7051" rel="L7051">the village; all the village runs to look; they take him past the mill,</li>
<li class="L7052" rel="L7052">and up to the prison; all the village sees the prison gate open in the</li>
<li class="L7053" rel="L7053">darkness of the night, and swallow him--like this!”</li>
<li class="L7054" rel="L7054"></li>
<li class="L7055" rel="L7055">He opened his mouth as wide as he could, and shut it with a sounding</li>
<li class="L7056" rel="L7056">snap of his teeth. Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by</li>
<li class="L7057" rel="L7057">opening it again, Defarge said, “Go on, Jacques.”</li>
<li class="L7058" rel="L7058"></li>
<li class="L7059" rel="L7059">“All the village,” pursued the mender of roads, on tiptoe and in a low</li>
<li class="L7060" rel="L7060">voice, “withdraws; all the village whispers by the fountain; all the</li>
<li class="L7061" rel="L7061">village sleeps; all the village dreams of that unhappy one, within the</li>
<li class="L7062" rel="L7062">locks and bars of the prison on the crag, and never to come out of it,</li>
<li class="L7063" rel="L7063">except to perish. In the morning, with my tools upon my shoulder, eating</li>
<li class="L7064" rel="L7064">my morsel of black bread as I go, I make a circuit by the prison, on</li>
<li class="L7065" rel="L7065">my way to my work. There I see him, high up, behind the bars of a lofty</li>
<li class="L7066" rel="L7066">iron cage, bloody and dusty as last night, looking through. He has no</li>
<li class="L7067" rel="L7067">hand free, to wave to me; I dare not call to him; he regards me like a</li>
<li class="L7068" rel="L7068">dead man.”</li>
<li class="L7069" rel="L7069"></li>
<li class="L7070" rel="L7070">Defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another. The looks of all</li>
<li class="L7071" rel="L7071">of them were dark, repressed, and revengeful, as they listened to the</li>
<li class="L7072" rel="L7072">countryman&#39;s story; the manner of all of them, while it was secret, was</li>
<li class="L7073" rel="L7073">authoritative too. They had the air of a rough tribunal; Jacques One</li>
<li class="L7074" rel="L7074">and Two sitting on the old pallet-bed, each with his chin resting on</li>
<li class="L7075" rel="L7075">his hand, and his eyes intent on the road-mender; Jacques Three, equally</li>
<li class="L7076" rel="L7076">intent, on one knee behind them, with his agitated hand always gliding</li>
<li class="L7077" rel="L7077">over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose; Defarge</li>
<li class="L7078" rel="L7078">standing between them and the narrator, whom he had stationed in the</li>
<li class="L7079" rel="L7079">light of the window, by turns looking from him to them, and from them to</li>
<li class="L7080" rel="L7080">him.</li>
<li class="L7081" rel="L7081"></li>
<li class="L7082" rel="L7082">“Go on, Jacques,” said Defarge.</li>
<li class="L7083" rel="L7083"></li>
<li class="L7084" rel="L7084">“He remains up there in his iron cage some days. The village looks</li>
<li class="L7085" rel="L7085">at him by stealth, for it is afraid. But it always looks up, from a</li>
<li class="L7086" rel="L7086">distance, at the prison on the crag; and in the evening, when the work</li>
<li class="L7087" rel="L7087">of the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain, all</li>
<li class="L7088" rel="L7088">faces are turned towards the prison. Formerly, they were turned towards</li>
<li class="L7089" rel="L7089">the posting-house; now, they are turned towards the prison. They</li>
<li class="L7090" rel="L7090">whisper at the fountain, that although condemned to death he will not be</li>
<li class="L7091" rel="L7091">executed; they say that petitions have been presented in Paris, showing</li>
<li class="L7092" rel="L7092">that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child; they say</li>
<li class="L7093" rel="L7093">that a petition has been presented to the King himself. What do I know?</li>
<li class="L7094" rel="L7094">It is possible. Perhaps yes, perhaps no.”</li>
<li class="L7095" rel="L7095"></li>
<li class="L7096" rel="L7096">“Listen then, Jacques,” Number One of that name sternly interposed.</li>
<li class="L7097" rel="L7097">“Know that a petition was presented to the King and Queen. All here,</li>
<li class="L7098" rel="L7098">yourself excepted, saw the King take it, in his carriage in the street,</li>
<li class="L7099" rel="L7099">sitting beside the Queen. It is Defarge whom you see here, who, at the</li>
<li class="L7100" rel="L7100">hazard of his life, darted out before the horses, with the petition in</li>
<li class="L7101" rel="L7101">his hand.”</li>
<li class="L7102" rel="L7102"></li>
<li class="L7103" rel="L7103">“And once again listen, Jacques!” said the kneeling Number Three:</li>
<li class="L7104" rel="L7104">his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves, with a</li>
<li class="L7105" rel="L7105">strikingly greedy air, as if he hungered for something--that was neither</li>
<li class="L7106" rel="L7106">food nor drink; “the guard, horse and foot, surrounded the petitioner,</li>
<li class="L7107" rel="L7107">and struck him blows. You hear?”</li>
<li class="L7108" rel="L7108"></li>
<li class="L7109" rel="L7109">“I hear, messieurs.”</li>
<li class="L7110" rel="L7110"></li>
<li class="L7111" rel="L7111">“Go on then,” said Defarge.</li>
<li class="L7112" rel="L7112"></li>
<li class="L7113" rel="L7113">“Again; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain,” resumed the</li>
<li class="L7114" rel="L7114">countryman, “that he is brought down into our country to be executed on</li>
<li class="L7115" rel="L7115">the spot, and that he will very certainly be executed. They even whisper</li>
<li class="L7116" rel="L7116">that because he has slain Monseigneur, and because Monseigneur was the</li>
<li class="L7117" rel="L7117">father of his tenants--serfs--what you will--he will be executed as a</li>
<li class="L7118" rel="L7118">parricide. One old man says at the fountain, that his right hand, armed</li>
<li class="L7119" rel="L7119">with the knife, will be burnt off before his face; that, into wounds</li>
<li class="L7120" rel="L7120">which will be made in his arms, his breast, and his legs, there will be</li>
<li class="L7121" rel="L7121">poured boiling oil, melted lead, hot resin, wax, and sulphur; finally,</li>
<li class="L7122" rel="L7122">that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses. That old man</li>
<li class="L7123" rel="L7123">says, all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on</li>
<li class="L7124" rel="L7124">the life of the late King, Louis Fifteen. But how do I know if he lies?</li>
<li class="L7125" rel="L7125">I am not a scholar.”</li>
<li class="L7126" rel="L7126"></li>
<li class="L7127" rel="L7127">“Listen once again then, Jacques!” said the man with the restless hand</li>
<li class="L7128" rel="L7128">and the craving air. “The name of that prisoner was Damiens, and it was</li>
<li class="L7129" rel="L7129">all done in open day, in the open streets of this city of Paris; and</li>
<li class="L7130" rel="L7130">nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done, than</li>
<li class="L7131" rel="L7131">the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion, who were full of eager</li>
<li class="L7132" rel="L7132">attention to the last--to the last, Jacques, prolonged until nightfall,</li>
<li class="L7133" rel="L7133">when he had lost two legs and an arm, and still breathed! And it was</li>
<li class="L7134" rel="L7134">done--why, how old are you?”</li>
<li class="L7135" rel="L7135"></li>
<li class="L7136" rel="L7136">“Thirty-five,” said the mender of roads, who looked sixty.</li>
<li class="L7137" rel="L7137"></li>
<li class="L7138" rel="L7138">“It was done when you were more than ten years old; you might have seen</li>
<li class="L7139" rel="L7139">it.”</li>
<li class="L7140" rel="L7140"></li>
<li class="L7141" rel="L7141">“Enough!” said Defarge, with grim impatience. “Long live the Devil! Go</li>
<li class="L7142" rel="L7142">on.”</li>
<li class="L7143" rel="L7143"></li>
<li class="L7144" rel="L7144">“Well! Some whisper this, some whisper that; they speak of nothing else;</li>
<li class="L7145" rel="L7145">even the fountain appears to fall to that tune. At length, on Sunday</li>
<li class="L7146" rel="L7146">night when all the village is asleep, come soldiers, winding down from</li>
<li class="L7147" rel="L7147">the prison, and their guns ring on the stones of the little street.</li>
<li class="L7148" rel="L7148">Workmen dig, workmen hammer, soldiers laugh and sing; in the morning, by</li>
<li class="L7149" rel="L7149">the fountain, there is raised a gallows forty feet high, poisoning the</li>
<li class="L7150" rel="L7150">water.”</li>
<li class="L7151" rel="L7151"></li>
<li class="L7152" rel="L7152">The mender of roads looked _through_ rather than _at_ the low ceiling,</li>
<li class="L7153" rel="L7153">and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky.</li>
<li class="L7154" rel="L7154"></li>
<li class="L7155" rel="L7155">“All work is stopped, all assemble there, nobody leads the cows out,</li>
<li class="L7156" rel="L7156">the cows are there with the rest. At midday, the roll of drums. Soldiers</li>
<li class="L7157" rel="L7157">have marched into the prison in the night, and he is in the midst</li>
<li class="L7158" rel="L7158">of many soldiers. He is bound as before, and in his mouth there is</li>
<li class="L7159" rel="L7159">a gag--tied so, with a tight string, making him look almost as if he</li>
<li class="L7160" rel="L7160">laughed.” He suggested it, by creasing his face with his two thumbs,</li>
<li class="L7161" rel="L7161">from the corners of his mouth to his ears. “On the top of the gallows is</li>
<li class="L7162" rel="L7162">fixed the knife, blade upwards, with its point in the air. He is hanged</li>
<li class="L7163" rel="L7163">there forty feet high--and is left hanging, poisoning the water.”</li>
<li class="L7164" rel="L7164"></li>
<li class="L7165" rel="L7165">They looked at one another, as he used his blue cap to wipe his face,</li>
<li class="L7166" rel="L7166">on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the</li>
<li class="L7167" rel="L7167">spectacle.</li>
<li class="L7168" rel="L7168"></li>
<li class="L7169" rel="L7169">“It is frightful, messieurs. How can the women and the children draw</li>
<li class="L7170" rel="L7170">water! Who can gossip of an evening, under that shadow! Under it, have</li>
<li class="L7171" rel="L7171">I said? When I left the village, Monday evening as the sun was going to</li>
<li class="L7172" rel="L7172">bed, and looked back from the hill, the shadow struck across the church,</li>
<li class="L7173" rel="L7173">across the mill, across the prison--seemed to strike across the earth,</li>
<li class="L7174" rel="L7174">messieurs, to where the sky rests upon it!”</li>
<li class="L7175" rel="L7175"></li>
<li class="L7176" rel="L7176">The hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other</li>
<li class="L7177" rel="L7177">three, and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him.</li>
<li class="L7178" rel="L7178"></li>
<li class="L7179" rel="L7179">“That&#39;s all, messieurs. I left at sunset (as I had been warned to do),</li>
<li class="L7180" rel="L7180">and I walked on, that night and half next day, until I met (as I was</li>
<li class="L7181" rel="L7181">warned I should) this comrade. With him, I came on, now riding and now</li>
<li class="L7182" rel="L7182">walking, through the rest of yesterday and through last night. And here</li>
<li class="L7183" rel="L7183">you see me!”</li>
<li class="L7184" rel="L7184"></li>
<li class="L7185" rel="L7185">After a gloomy silence, the first Jacques said, “Good! You have acted</li>
<li class="L7186" rel="L7186">and recounted faithfully. Will you wait for us a little, outside the</li>
<li class="L7187" rel="L7187">door?”</li>
<li class="L7188" rel="L7188"></li>
<li class="L7189" rel="L7189">“Very willingly,” said the mender of roads. Whom Defarge escorted to the</li>
<li class="L7190" rel="L7190">top of the stairs, and, leaving seated there, returned.</li>
<li class="L7191" rel="L7191"></li>
<li class="L7192" rel="L7192">The three had risen, and their heads were together when he came back to</li>
<li class="L7193" rel="L7193">the garret.</li>
<li class="L7194" rel="L7194"></li>
<li class="L7195" rel="L7195">“How say you, Jacques?” demanded Number One. “To be registered?”</li>
<li class="L7196" rel="L7196"></li>
<li class="L7197" rel="L7197">“To be registered, as doomed to destruction,” returned Defarge.</li>
<li class="L7198" rel="L7198"></li>
<li class="L7199" rel="L7199">“Magnificent!” croaked the man with the craving.</li>
<li class="L7200" rel="L7200"></li>
<li class="L7201" rel="L7201">“The chateau, and all the race?” inquired the first.</li>
<li class="L7202" rel="L7202"></li>
<li class="L7203" rel="L7203">“The chateau and all the race,” returned Defarge. “Extermination.”</li>
<li class="L7204" rel="L7204"></li>
<li class="L7205" rel="L7205">The hungry man repeated, in a rapturous croak, “Magnificent!” and began</li>
<li class="L7206" rel="L7206">gnawing another finger.</li>
<li class="L7207" rel="L7207"></li>
<li class="L7208" rel="L7208">“Are you sure,” asked Jacques Two, of Defarge, “that no embarrassment</li>
<li class="L7209" rel="L7209">can arise from our manner of keeping the register? Without doubt it is</li>
<li class="L7210" rel="L7210">safe, for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it; but shall we always</li>
<li class="L7211" rel="L7211">be able to decipher it--or, I ought to say, will she?”</li>
<li class="L7212" rel="L7212"></li>
<li class="L7213" rel="L7213">“Jacques,” returned Defarge, drawing himself up, “if madame my wife</li>
<li class="L7214" rel="L7214">undertook to keep the register in her memory alone, she would not lose</li>
<li class="L7215" rel="L7215">a word of it--not a syllable of it. Knitted, in her own stitches and her</li>
<li class="L7216" rel="L7216">own symbols, it will always be as plain to her as the sun. Confide in</li>
<li class="L7217" rel="L7217">Madame Defarge. It would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives,</li>
<li class="L7218" rel="L7218">to erase himself from existence, than to erase one letter of his name or</li>
<li class="L7219" rel="L7219">crimes from the knitted register of Madame Defarge.”</li>
<li class="L7220" rel="L7220"></li>
<li class="L7221" rel="L7221">There was a murmur of confidence and approval, and then the man who</li>
<li class="L7222" rel="L7222">hungered, asked: “Is this rustic to be sent back soon? I hope so. He is</li>
<li class="L7223" rel="L7223">very simple; is he not a little dangerous?”</li>
<li class="L7224" rel="L7224"></li>
<li class="L7225" rel="L7225">“He knows nothing,” said Defarge; “at least nothing more than would</li>
<li class="L7226" rel="L7226">easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height. I charge myself</li>
<li class="L7227" rel="L7227">with him; let him remain with me; I will take care of him, and set him</li>
<li class="L7228" rel="L7228">on his road. He wishes to see the fine world--the King, the Queen, and</li>
<li class="L7229" rel="L7229">Court; let him see them on Sunday.”</li>
<li class="L7230" rel="L7230"></li>
<li class="L7231" rel="L7231">“What?” exclaimed the hungry man, staring. “Is it a good sign, that he</li>
<li class="L7232" rel="L7232">wishes to see Royalty and Nobility?”</li>
<li class="L7233" rel="L7233"></li>
<li class="L7234" rel="L7234">“Jacques,” said Defarge; “judiciously show a cat milk, if you wish her</li>
<li class="L7235" rel="L7235">to thirst for it. Judiciously show a dog his natural prey, if you wish</li>
<li class="L7236" rel="L7236">him to bring it down one day.”</li>
<li class="L7237" rel="L7237"></li>
<li class="L7238" rel="L7238">Nothing more was said, and the mender of roads, being found already</li>
<li class="L7239" rel="L7239">dozing on the topmost stair, was advised to lay himself down on the</li>
<li class="L7240" rel="L7240">pallet-bed and take some rest. He needed no persuasion, and was soon</li>
<li class="L7241" rel="L7241">asleep.</li>
<li class="L7242" rel="L7242"></li>
<li class="L7243" rel="L7243">Worse quarters than Defarge&#39;s wine-shop, could easily have been found</li>
<li class="L7244" rel="L7244">in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree. Saving for a mysterious</li>
<li class="L7245" rel="L7245">dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted, his life was very</li>
<li class="L7246" rel="L7246">new and agreeable. But, madame sat all day at her counter, so expressly</li>
<li class="L7247" rel="L7247">unconscious of him, and so particularly determined not to perceive that</li>
<li class="L7248" rel="L7248">his being there had any connection with anything below the surface, that</li>
<li class="L7249" rel="L7249">he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her. For, he</li>
<li class="L7250" rel="L7250">contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady</li>
<li class="L7251" rel="L7251">might pretend next; and he felt assured that if she should take it</li>
<li class="L7252" rel="L7252">into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a</li>
<li class="L7253" rel="L7253">murder and afterwards flay the victim, she would infallibly go through</li>
<li class="L7254" rel="L7254">with it until the play was played out.</li>
<li class="L7255" rel="L7255"></li>
<li class="L7256" rel="L7256">Therefore, when Sunday came, the mender of roads was not enchanted</li>
<li class="L7257" rel="L7257">(though he said he was) to find that madame was to accompany monsieur</li>
<li class="L7258" rel="L7258">and himself to Versailles. It was additionally disconcerting to have</li>
<li class="L7259" rel="L7259">madame knitting all the way there, in a public conveyance; it was</li>
<li class="L7260" rel="L7260">additionally disconcerting yet, to have madame in the crowd in the</li>
<li class="L7261" rel="L7261">afternoon, still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to</li>
<li class="L7262" rel="L7262">see the carriage of the King and Queen.</li>
<li class="L7263" rel="L7263"></li>
<li class="L7264" rel="L7264">“You work hard, madame,” said a man near her.</li>
<li class="L7265" rel="L7265"></li>
<li class="L7266" rel="L7266">“Yes,” answered Madame Defarge; “I have a good deal to do.”</li>
<li class="L7267" rel="L7267"></li>
<li class="L7268" rel="L7268">“What do you make, madame?”</li>
<li class="L7269" rel="L7269"></li>
<li class="L7270" rel="L7270">“Many things.”</li>
<li class="L7271" rel="L7271"></li>
<li class="L7272" rel="L7272">“For instance--”</li>
<li class="L7273" rel="L7273"></li>
<li class="L7274" rel="L7274">“For instance,” returned Madame Defarge, composedly, “shrouds.”</li>
<li class="L7275" rel="L7275"></li>
<li class="L7276" rel="L7276">The man moved a little further away, as soon as he could, and the mender</li>
<li class="L7277" rel="L7277">of roads fanned himself with his blue cap: feeling it mightily close</li>
<li class="L7278" rel="L7278">and oppressive. If he needed a King and Queen to restore him, he was</li>
<li class="L7279" rel="L7279">fortunate in having his remedy at hand; for, soon the large-faced King</li>
<li class="L7280" rel="L7280">and the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach, attended by the</li>
<li class="L7281" rel="L7281">shining Bull&#39;s Eye of their Court, a glittering multitude of laughing</li>
<li class="L7282" rel="L7282">ladies and fine lords; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour</li>
<li class="L7283" rel="L7283">and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both</li>
<li class="L7284" rel="L7284">sexes, the mender of roads bathed himself, so much to his temporary</li>
<li class="L7285" rel="L7285">intoxication, that he cried Long live the King, Long live the Queen,</li>
<li class="L7286" rel="L7286">Long live everybody and everything! as if he had never heard of</li>
<li class="L7287" rel="L7287">ubiquitous Jacques in his time. Then, there were gardens, courtyards,</li>
<li class="L7288" rel="L7288">terraces, fountains, green banks, more King and Queen, more Bull&#39;s Eye,</li>
<li class="L7289" rel="L7289">more lords and ladies, more Long live they all! until he absolutely wept</li>
<li class="L7290" rel="L7290">with sentiment. During the whole of this scene, which lasted some three</li>
<li class="L7291" rel="L7291">hours, he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company,</li>
<li class="L7292" rel="L7292">and throughout Defarge held him by the collar, as if to restrain him</li>
<li class="L7293" rel="L7293">from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to</li>
<li class="L7294" rel="L7294">pieces.</li>
<li class="L7295" rel="L7295"></li>
<li class="L7296" rel="L7296">“Bravo!” said Defarge, clapping him on the back when it was over, like a</li>
<li class="L7297" rel="L7297">patron; “you are a good boy!”</li>
<li class="L7298" rel="L7298"></li>
<li class="L7299" rel="L7299">The mender of roads was now coming to himself, and was mistrustful of</li>
<li class="L7300" rel="L7300">having made a mistake in his late demonstrations; but no.</li>
<li class="L7301" rel="L7301"></li>
<li class="L7302" rel="L7302">“You are the fellow we want,” said Defarge, in his ear; “you make</li>
<li class="L7303" rel="L7303">these fools believe that it will last for ever. Then, they are the more</li>
<li class="L7304" rel="L7304">insolent, and it is the nearer ended.”</li>
<li class="L7305" rel="L7305"></li>
<li class="L7306" rel="L7306">“Hey!” cried the mender of roads, reflectively; “that&#39;s true.”</li>
<li class="L7307" rel="L7307"></li>
<li class="L7308" rel="L7308">“These fools know nothing. While they despise your breath, and would</li>
<li class="L7309" rel="L7309">stop it for ever and ever, in you or in a hundred like you rather than</li>
<li class="L7310" rel="L7310">in one of their own horses or dogs, they only know what your breath</li>
<li class="L7311" rel="L7311">tells them. Let it deceive them, then, a little longer; it cannot</li>
<li class="L7312" rel="L7312">deceive them too much.”</li>
<li class="L7313" rel="L7313"></li>
<li class="L7314" rel="L7314">Madame Defarge looked superciliously at the client, and nodded in</li>
<li class="L7315" rel="L7315">confirmation.</li>
<li class="L7316" rel="L7316"></li>
<li class="L7317" rel="L7317">“As to you,” said she, “you would shout and shed tears for anything, if</li>
<li class="L7318" rel="L7318">it made a show and a noise. Say! Would you not?”</li>
<li class="L7319" rel="L7319"></li>
<li class="L7320" rel="L7320">“Truly, madame, I think so. For the moment.”</li>
<li class="L7321" rel="L7321"></li>
<li class="L7322" rel="L7322">“If you were shown a great heap of dolls, and were set upon them to</li>
<li class="L7323" rel="L7323">pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage, you would</li>
<li class="L7324" rel="L7324">pick out the richest and gayest. Say! Would you not?”</li>
<li class="L7325" rel="L7325"></li>
<li class="L7326" rel="L7326">“Truly yes, madame.”</li>
<li class="L7327" rel="L7327"></li>
<li class="L7328" rel="L7328">“Yes. And if you were shown a flock of birds, unable to fly, and were</li>
<li class="L7329" rel="L7329">set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage,</li>
<li class="L7330" rel="L7330">you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers; would you not?”</li>
<li class="L7331" rel="L7331"></li>
<li class="L7332" rel="L7332">“It is true, madame.”</li>
<li class="L7333" rel="L7333"></li>
<li class="L7334" rel="L7334">“You have seen both dolls and birds to-day,” said Madame Defarge, with</li>
<li class="L7335" rel="L7335">a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent;</li>
<li class="L7336" rel="L7336">“now, go home!”</li>
<li class="L7337" rel="L7337"></li>
<li class="L7338" rel="L7338"></li>
<li class="L7339" rel="L7339"></li>
<li class="L7340" rel="L7340"></li>
<li class="L7341" rel="L7341">XVI. Still Knitting</li>
<li class="L7342" rel="L7342"></li>
<li class="L7343" rel="L7343"></li>
<li class="L7344" rel="L7344">Madame Defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the</li>
<li class="L7345" rel="L7345">bosom of Saint Antoine, while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the</li>
<li class="L7346" rel="L7346">darkness, and through the dust, and down the weary miles of avenue by</li>
<li class="L7347" rel="L7347">the wayside, slowly tending towards that point of the compass where</li>
<li class="L7348" rel="L7348">the chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, now in his grave, listened to</li>
<li class="L7349" rel="L7349">the whispering trees. Such ample leisure had the stone faces, now,</li>
<li class="L7350" rel="L7350">for listening to the trees and to the fountain, that the few village</li>
<li class="L7351" rel="L7351">scarecrows who, in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead</li>
<li class="L7352" rel="L7352">stick to burn, strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and</li>
<li class="L7353" rel="L7353">terrace staircase, had it borne in upon their starved fancy that</li>
<li class="L7354" rel="L7354">the expression of the faces was altered. A rumour just lived in the</li>
<li class="L7355" rel="L7355">village--had a faint and bare existence there, as its people had--that</li>
<li class="L7356" rel="L7356">when the knife struck home, the faces changed, from faces of pride to</li>
<li class="L7357" rel="L7357">faces of anger and pain; also, that when that dangling figure was hauled</li>
<li class="L7358" rel="L7358">up forty feet above the fountain, they changed again, and bore a cruel</li>
<li class="L7359" rel="L7359">look of being avenged, which they would henceforth bear for ever. In the</li>
<li class="L7360" rel="L7360">stone face over the great window of the bed-chamber where the murder</li>
<li class="L7361" rel="L7361">was done, two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose, which</li>
<li class="L7362" rel="L7362">everybody recognised, and which nobody had seen of old; and on the</li>
<li class="L7363" rel="L7363">scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the</li>
<li class="L7364" rel="L7364">crowd to take a hurried peep at Monsieur the Marquis petrified, a</li>
<li class="L7365" rel="L7365">skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute, before they all</li>
<li class="L7366" rel="L7366">started away among the moss and leaves, like the more fortunate hares</li>
<li class="L7367" rel="L7367">who could find a living there.</li>
<li class="L7368" rel="L7368"></li>
<li class="L7369" rel="L7369">Chateau and hut, stone face and dangling figure, the red stain on the</li>
<li class="L7370" rel="L7370">stone floor, and the pure water in the village well--thousands of acres</li>
<li class="L7371" rel="L7371">of land--a whole province of France--all France itself--lay under the</li>
<li class="L7372" rel="L7372">night sky, concentrated into a faint hair-breadth line. So does a whole</li>
<li class="L7373" rel="L7373">world, with all its greatnesses and littlenesses, lie in a twinkling</li>
<li class="L7374" rel="L7374">star. And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse</li>
<li class="L7375" rel="L7375">the manner of its composition, so, sublimer intelligences may read in</li>
<li class="L7376" rel="L7376">the feeble shining of this earth of ours, every thought and act, every</li>
<li class="L7377" rel="L7377">vice and virtue, of every responsible creature on it.</li>
<li class="L7378" rel="L7378"></li>
<li class="L7379" rel="L7379">The Defarges, husband and wife, came lumbering under the starlight,</li>
<li class="L7380" rel="L7380">in their public vehicle, to that gate of Paris whereunto their</li>
<li class="L7381" rel="L7381">journey naturally tended. There was the usual stoppage at the barrier</li>
<li class="L7382" rel="L7382">guardhouse, and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual</li>
<li class="L7383" rel="L7383">examination and inquiry. Monsieur Defarge alighted; knowing one or two</li>
<li class="L7384" rel="L7384">of the soldiery there, and one of the police. The latter he was intimate</li>
<li class="L7385" rel="L7385">with, and affectionately embraced.</li>
<li class="L7386" rel="L7386"></li>
<li class="L7387" rel="L7387">When Saint Antoine had again enfolded the Defarges in his dusky wings,</li>
<li class="L7388" rel="L7388">and they, having finally alighted near the Saint&#39;s boundaries, were</li>
<li class="L7389" rel="L7389">picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his</li>
<li class="L7390" rel="L7390">streets, Madame Defarge spoke to her husband:</li>
<li class="L7391" rel="L7391"></li>
<li class="L7392" rel="L7392">“Say then, my friend; what did Jacques of the police tell thee?”</li>
<li class="L7393" rel="L7393"></li>
<li class="L7394" rel="L7394">“Very little to-night, but all he knows. There is another spy</li>
<li class="L7395" rel="L7395">commissioned for our quarter. There may be many more, for all that he</li>
<li class="L7396" rel="L7396">can say, but he knows of one.”</li>
<li class="L7397" rel="L7397"></li>
<li class="L7398" rel="L7398">“Eh well!” said Madame Defarge, raising her eyebrows with a cool</li>
<li class="L7399" rel="L7399">business air. “It is necessary to register him. How do they call that</li>
<li class="L7400" rel="L7400">man?”</li>
<li class="L7401" rel="L7401"></li>
<li class="L7402" rel="L7402">“He is English.”</li>
<li class="L7403" rel="L7403"></li>
<li class="L7404" rel="L7404">“So much the better. His name?”</li>
<li class="L7405" rel="L7405"></li>
<li class="L7406" rel="L7406">“Barsad,” said Defarge, making it French by pronunciation. But, he had</li>
<li class="L7407" rel="L7407">been so careful to get it accurately, that he then spelt it with perfect</li>
<li class="L7408" rel="L7408">correctness.</li>
<li class="L7409" rel="L7409"></li>
<li class="L7410" rel="L7410">“Barsad,” repeated madame. “Good. Christian name?”</li>
<li class="L7411" rel="L7411"></li>
<li class="L7412" rel="L7412">“John.”</li>
<li class="L7413" rel="L7413"></li>
<li class="L7414" rel="L7414">“John Barsad,” repeated madame, after murmuring it once to herself.</li>
<li class="L7415" rel="L7415">“Good. His appearance; is it known?”</li>
<li class="L7416" rel="L7416"></li>
<li class="L7417" rel="L7417">“Age, about forty years; height, about five feet nine; black hair;</li>
<li class="L7418" rel="L7418">complexion dark; generally, rather handsome visage; eyes dark, face</li>
<li class="L7419" rel="L7419">thin, long, and sallow; nose aquiline, but not straight, having a</li>
<li class="L7420" rel="L7420">peculiar inclination towards the left cheek; expression, therefore,</li>
<li class="L7421" rel="L7421">sinister.”</li>
<li class="L7422" rel="L7422"></li>
<li class="L7423" rel="L7423">“Eh my faith. It is a portrait!” said madame, laughing. “He shall be</li>
<li class="L7424" rel="L7424">registered to-morrow.”</li>
<li class="L7425" rel="L7425"></li>
<li class="L7426" rel="L7426">They turned into the wine-shop, which was closed (for it was midnight),</li>
<li class="L7427" rel="L7427">and where Madame Defarge immediately took her post at her desk, counted</li>
<li class="L7428" rel="L7428">the small moneys that had been taken during her absence, examined the</li>
<li class="L7429" rel="L7429">stock, went through the entries in the book, made other entries of</li>
<li class="L7430" rel="L7430">her own, checked the serving man in every possible way, and finally</li>
<li class="L7431" rel="L7431">dismissed him to bed. Then she turned out the contents of the bowl</li>
<li class="L7432" rel="L7432">of money for the second time, and began knotting them up in her</li>
<li class="L7433" rel="L7433">handkerchief, in a chain of separate knots, for safe keeping through the</li>
<li class="L7434" rel="L7434">night. All this while, Defarge, with his pipe in his mouth, walked</li>
<li class="L7435" rel="L7435">up and down, complacently admiring, but never interfering; in which</li>
<li class="L7436" rel="L7436">condition, indeed, as to the business and his domestic affairs, he</li>
<li class="L7437" rel="L7437">walked up and down through life.</li>
<li class="L7438" rel="L7438"></li>
<li class="L7439" rel="L7439">The night was hot, and the shop, close shut and surrounded by so foul a</li>
<li class="L7440" rel="L7440">neighbourhood, was ill-smelling. Monsieur Defarge&#39;s olfactory sense was</li>
<li class="L7441" rel="L7441">by no means delicate, but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than</li>
<li class="L7442" rel="L7442">it ever tasted, and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed. He</li>
<li class="L7443" rel="L7443">whiffed the compound of scents away, as he put down his smoked-out pipe.</li>
<li class="L7444" rel="L7444"></li>
<li class="L7445" rel="L7445">“You are fatigued,” said madame, raising her glance as she knotted the</li>
<li class="L7446" rel="L7446">money. “There are only the usual odours.”</li>
<li class="L7447" rel="L7447"></li>
<li class="L7448" rel="L7448">“I am a little tired,” her husband acknowledged.</li>
<li class="L7449" rel="L7449"></li>
<li class="L7450" rel="L7450">“You are a little depressed, too,” said madame, whose quick eyes had</li>
<li class="L7451" rel="L7451">never been so intent on the accounts, but they had had a ray or two for</li>
<li class="L7452" rel="L7452">him. “Oh, the men, the men!”</li>
<li class="L7453" rel="L7453"></li>
<li class="L7454" rel="L7454">“But my dear!” began Defarge.</li>
<li class="L7455" rel="L7455"></li>
<li class="L7456" rel="L7456">“But my dear!” repeated madame, nodding firmly; “but my dear! You are</li>
<li class="L7457" rel="L7457">faint of heart to-night, my dear!”</li>
<li class="L7458" rel="L7458"></li>
<li class="L7459" rel="L7459">“Well, then,” said Defarge, as if a thought were wrung out of his</li>
<li class="L7460" rel="L7460">breast, “it _is_ a long time.”</li>
<li class="L7461" rel="L7461"></li>
<li class="L7462" rel="L7462">“It is a long time,” repeated his wife; “and when is it not a long time?</li>
<li class="L7463" rel="L7463">Vengeance and retribution require a long time; it is the rule.”</li>
<li class="L7464" rel="L7464"></li>
<li class="L7465" rel="L7465">“It does not take a long time to strike a man with Lightning,” said</li>
<li class="L7466" rel="L7466">Defarge.</li>
<li class="L7467" rel="L7467"></li>
<li class="L7468" rel="L7468">“How long,” demanded madame, composedly, “does it take to make and store</li>
<li class="L7469" rel="L7469">the lightning? Tell me.”</li>
<li class="L7470" rel="L7470"></li>
<li class="L7471" rel="L7471">Defarge raised his head thoughtfully, as if there were something in that</li>
<li class="L7472" rel="L7472">too.</li>
<li class="L7473" rel="L7473"></li>
<li class="L7474" rel="L7474">“It does not take a long time,” said madame, “for an earthquake to</li>
<li class="L7475" rel="L7475">swallow a town. Eh well! Tell me how long it takes to prepare the</li>
<li class="L7476" rel="L7476">earthquake?”</li>
<li class="L7477" rel="L7477"></li>
<li class="L7478" rel="L7478">“A long time, I suppose,” said Defarge.</li>
<li class="L7479" rel="L7479"></li>
<li class="L7480" rel="L7480">“But when it is ready, it takes place, and grinds to pieces everything</li>
<li class="L7481" rel="L7481">before it. In the meantime, it is always preparing, though it is not</li>
<li class="L7482" rel="L7482">seen or heard. That is your consolation. Keep it.”</li>
<li class="L7483" rel="L7483"></li>
<li class="L7484" rel="L7484">She tied a knot with flashing eyes, as if it throttled a foe.</li>
<li class="L7485" rel="L7485"></li>
<li class="L7486" rel="L7486">“I tell thee,” said madame, extending her right hand, for emphasis,</li>
<li class="L7487" rel="L7487">“that although it is a long time on the road, it is on the road and</li>
<li class="L7488" rel="L7488">coming. I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops. I tell thee it</li>
<li class="L7489" rel="L7489">is always advancing. Look around and consider the lives of all the world</li>
<li class="L7490" rel="L7490">that we know, consider the faces of all the world that we know, consider</li>
<li class="L7491" rel="L7491">the rage and discontent to which the Jacquerie addresses itself with</li>
<li class="L7492" rel="L7492">more and more of certainty every hour. Can such things last? Bah! I mock</li>
<li class="L7493" rel="L7493">you.”</li>
<li class="L7494" rel="L7494"></li>
<li class="L7495" rel="L7495">“My brave wife,” returned Defarge, standing before her with his head</li>
<li class="L7496" rel="L7496">a little bent, and his hands clasped at his back, like a docile and</li>
<li class="L7497" rel="L7497">attentive pupil before his catechist, “I do not question all this. But</li>
<li class="L7498" rel="L7498">it has lasted a long time, and it is possible--you know well, my wife,</li>
<li class="L7499" rel="L7499">it is possible--that it may not come, during our lives.”</li>
<li class="L7500" rel="L7500"></li>
<li class="L7501" rel="L7501">“Eh well! How then?” demanded madame, tying another knot, as if there</li>
<li class="L7502" rel="L7502">were another enemy strangled.</li>
<li class="L7503" rel="L7503"></li>
<li class="L7504" rel="L7504">“Well!” said Defarge, with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug.</li>
<li class="L7505" rel="L7505">“We shall not see the triumph.”</li>
<li class="L7506" rel="L7506"></li>
<li class="L7507" rel="L7507">“We shall have helped it,” returned madame, with her extended hand in</li>
<li class="L7508" rel="L7508">strong action. “Nothing that we do, is done in vain. I believe, with all</li>
<li class="L7509" rel="L7509">my soul, that we shall see the triumph. But even if not, even if I knew</li>
<li class="L7510" rel="L7510">certainly not, show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant, and still I</li>
<li class="L7511" rel="L7511">would--”</li>
<li class="L7512" rel="L7512"></li>
<li class="L7513" rel="L7513">Then madame, with her teeth set, tied a very terrible knot indeed.</li>
<li class="L7514" rel="L7514"></li>
<li class="L7515" rel="L7515">“Hold!” cried Defarge, reddening a little as if he felt charged with</li>
<li class="L7516" rel="L7516">cowardice; “I too, my dear, will stop at nothing.”</li>
<li class="L7517" rel="L7517"></li>
<li class="L7518" rel="L7518">“Yes! But it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim</li>
<li class="L7519" rel="L7519">and your opportunity, to sustain you. Sustain yourself without that.</li>
<li class="L7520" rel="L7520">When the time comes, let loose a tiger and a devil; but wait for the</li>
<li class="L7521" rel="L7521">time with the tiger and the devil chained--not shown--yet always ready.”</li>
<li class="L7522" rel="L7522"></li>
<li class="L7523" rel="L7523">Madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her</li>
<li class="L7524" rel="L7524">little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains</li>
<li class="L7525" rel="L7525">out, and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in a serene</li>
<li class="L7526" rel="L7526">manner, and observing that it was time to go to bed.</li>
<li class="L7527" rel="L7527"></li>
<li class="L7528" rel="L7528">Next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the</li>
<li class="L7529" rel="L7529">wine-shop, knitting away assiduously. A rose lay beside her, and if she</li>
<li class="L7530" rel="L7530">now and then glanced at the flower, it was with no infraction of her</li>
<li class="L7531" rel="L7531">usual preoccupied air. There were a few customers, drinking or not</li>
<li class="L7532" rel="L7532">drinking, standing or seated, sprinkled about. The day was very hot,</li>
<li class="L7533" rel="L7533">and heaps of flies, who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous</li>
<li class="L7534" rel="L7534">perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame, fell</li>
<li class="L7535" rel="L7535">dead at the bottom. Their decease made no impression on the other flies</li>
<li class="L7536" rel="L7536">out promenading, who looked at them in the coolest manner (as if they</li>
<li class="L7537" rel="L7537">themselves were elephants, or something as far removed), until they met</li>
<li class="L7538" rel="L7538">the same fate. Curious to consider how heedless flies are!--perhaps they</li>
<li class="L7539" rel="L7539">thought as much at Court that sunny summer day.</li>
<li class="L7540" rel="L7540"></li>
<li class="L7541" rel="L7541">A figure entering at the door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge which she</li>
<li class="L7542" rel="L7542">felt to be a new one. She laid down her knitting, and began to pin her</li>
<li class="L7543" rel="L7543">rose in her head-dress, before she looked at the figure.</li>
<li class="L7544" rel="L7544"></li>
<li class="L7545" rel="L7545">It was curious. The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose, the</li>
<li class="L7546" rel="L7546">customers ceased talking, and began gradually to drop out of the</li>
<li class="L7547" rel="L7547">wine-shop.</li>
<li class="L7548" rel="L7548"></li>
<li class="L7549" rel="L7549">“Good day, madame,” said the new-comer.</li>
<li class="L7550" rel="L7550"></li>
<li class="L7551" rel="L7551">“Good day, monsieur.”</li>
<li class="L7552" rel="L7552"></li>
<li class="L7553" rel="L7553">She said it aloud, but added to herself, as she resumed her knitting:</li>
<li class="L7554" rel="L7554">“Hah! Good day, age about forty, height about five feet nine, black</li>
<li class="L7555" rel="L7555">hair, generally rather handsome visage, complexion dark, eyes dark,</li>
<li class="L7556" rel="L7556">thin, long and sallow face, aquiline nose but not straight, having a</li>
<li class="L7557" rel="L7557">peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister</li>
<li class="L7558" rel="L7558">expression! Good day, one and all!”</li>
<li class="L7559" rel="L7559"></li>
<li class="L7560" rel="L7560">“Have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a</li>
<li class="L7561" rel="L7561">mouthful of cool fresh water, madame.”</li>
<li class="L7562" rel="L7562"></li>
<li class="L7563" rel="L7563">Madame complied with a polite air.</li>
<li class="L7564" rel="L7564"></li>
<li class="L7565" rel="L7565">“Marvellous cognac this, madame!”</li>
<li class="L7566" rel="L7566"></li>
<li class="L7567" rel="L7567">It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame</li>
<li class="L7568" rel="L7568">Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said,</li>
<li class="L7569" rel="L7569">however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting. The</li>
<li class="L7570" rel="L7570">visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity</li>
<li class="L7571" rel="L7571">of observing the place in general.</li>
<li class="L7572" rel="L7572"></li>
<li class="L7573" rel="L7573">“You knit with great skill, madame.”</li>
<li class="L7574" rel="L7574"></li>
<li class="L7575" rel="L7575">“I am accustomed to it.”</li>
<li class="L7576" rel="L7576"></li>
<li class="L7577" rel="L7577">“A pretty pattern too!”</li>
<li class="L7578" rel="L7578"></li>
<li class="L7579" rel="L7579">“_You_ think so?” said madame, looking at him with a smile.</li>
<li class="L7580" rel="L7580"></li>
<li class="L7581" rel="L7581">“Decidedly. May one ask what it is for?”</li>
<li class="L7582" rel="L7582"></li>
<li class="L7583" rel="L7583">“Pastime,” said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her</li>
<li class="L7584" rel="L7584">fingers moved nimbly.</li>
<li class="L7585" rel="L7585"></li>
<li class="L7586" rel="L7586">“Not for use?”</li>
<li class="L7587" rel="L7587"></li>
<li class="L7588" rel="L7588">“That depends. I may find a use for it one day. If I do--Well,” said</li>
<li class="L7589" rel="L7589">madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of</li>
<li class="L7590" rel="L7590">coquetry, “I&#39;ll use it!”</li>
<li class="L7591" rel="L7591"></li>
<li class="L7592" rel="L7592">It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be</li>
<li class="L7593" rel="L7593">decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge. Two</li>
<li class="L7594" rel="L7594">men had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when,</li>
<li class="L7595" rel="L7595">catching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of</li>
<li class="L7596" rel="L7596">looking about as if for some friend who was not there, and went away.</li>
<li class="L7597" rel="L7597">Nor, of those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there</li>
<li class="L7598" rel="L7598">one left. They had all dropped off. The spy had kept his eyes open,</li>
<li class="L7599" rel="L7599">but had been able to detect no sign. They had lounged away in a</li>
<li class="L7600" rel="L7600">poverty-stricken, purposeless, accidental manner, quite natural and</li>
<li class="L7601" rel="L7601">unimpeachable.</li>
<li class="L7602" rel="L7602"></li>
<li class="L7603" rel="L7603">“_John_,” thought madame, checking off her work as her fingers knitted,</li>
<li class="L7604" rel="L7604">and her eyes looked at the stranger. “Stay long enough, and I shall knit</li>
<li class="L7605" rel="L7605">&#39;BARSAD&#39; before you go.”</li>
<li class="L7606" rel="L7606"></li>
<li class="L7607" rel="L7607">“You have a husband, madame?”</li>
<li class="L7608" rel="L7608"></li>
<li class="L7609" rel="L7609">“I have.”</li>
<li class="L7610" rel="L7610"></li>
<li class="L7611" rel="L7611">“Children?”</li>
<li class="L7612" rel="L7612"></li>
<li class="L7613" rel="L7613">“No children.”</li>
<li class="L7614" rel="L7614"></li>
<li class="L7615" rel="L7615">“Business seems bad?”</li>
<li class="L7616" rel="L7616"></li>
<li class="L7617" rel="L7617">“Business is very bad; the people are so poor.”</li>
<li class="L7618" rel="L7618"></li>
<li class="L7619" rel="L7619">“Ah, the unfortunate, miserable people! So oppressed, too--as you say.”</li>
<li class="L7620" rel="L7620"></li>
<li class="L7621" rel="L7621">“As _you_ say,” madame retorted, correcting him, and deftly knitting an</li>
<li class="L7622" rel="L7622">extra something into his name that boded him no good.</li>
<li class="L7623" rel="L7623"></li>
<li class="L7624" rel="L7624">“Pardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think so.</li>
<li class="L7625" rel="L7625">Of course.”</li>
<li class="L7626" rel="L7626"></li>
<li class="L7627" rel="L7627">“_I_ think?” returned madame, in a high voice. “I and my husband have</li>
<li class="L7628" rel="L7628">enough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking. All we</li>
<li class="L7629" rel="L7629">think, here, is how to live. That is the subject _we_ think of, and</li>
<li class="L7630" rel="L7630">it gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about, without</li>
<li class="L7631" rel="L7631">embarrassing our heads concerning others. _I_ think for others? No, no.”</li>
<li class="L7632" rel="L7632"></li>
<li class="L7633" rel="L7633">The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make, did</li>
<li class="L7634" rel="L7634">not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face; but,</li>
<li class="L7635" rel="L7635">stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on Madame</li>
<li class="L7636" rel="L7636">Defarge&#39;s little counter, and occasionally sipping his cognac.</li>
<li class="L7637" rel="L7637"></li>
<li class="L7638" rel="L7638">“A bad business this, madame, of Gaspard&#39;s execution. Ah! the poor</li>
<li class="L7639" rel="L7639">Gaspard!” With a sigh of great compassion.</li>
<li class="L7640" rel="L7640"></li>
<li class="L7641" rel="L7641">“My faith!” returned madame, coolly and lightly, “if people use knives</li>
<li class="L7642" rel="L7642">for such purposes, they have to pay for it. He knew beforehand what the</li>
<li class="L7643" rel="L7643">price of his luxury was; he has paid the price.”</li>
<li class="L7644" rel="L7644"></li>
<li class="L7645" rel="L7645">“I believe,” said the spy, dropping his soft voice to a tone</li>
<li class="L7646" rel="L7646">that invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary</li>
<li class="L7647" rel="L7647">susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face: “I believe there</li>
<li class="L7648" rel="L7648">is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor</li>
<li class="L7649" rel="L7649">fellow? Between ourselves.”</li>
<li class="L7650" rel="L7650"></li>
<li class="L7651" rel="L7651">“Is there?” asked madame, vacantly.</li>
<li class="L7652" rel="L7652"></li>
<li class="L7653" rel="L7653">“Is there not?”</li>
<li class="L7654" rel="L7654"></li>
<li class="L7655" rel="L7655">“--Here is my husband!” said Madame Defarge.</li>
<li class="L7656" rel="L7656"></li>
<li class="L7657" rel="L7657">As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted</li>
<li class="L7658" rel="L7658">him by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, “Good day,</li>
<li class="L7659" rel="L7659">Jacques!” Defarge stopped short, and stared at him.</li>
<li class="L7660" rel="L7660"></li>
<li class="L7661" rel="L7661">“Good day, Jacques!” the spy repeated; with not quite so much</li>
<li class="L7662" rel="L7662">confidence, or quite so easy a smile under the stare.</li>
<li class="L7663" rel="L7663"></li>
<li class="L7664" rel="L7664">“You deceive yourself, monsieur,” returned the keeper of the wine-shop.</li>
<li class="L7665" rel="L7665">“You mistake me for another. That is not my name. I am Ernest Defarge.”</li>
<li class="L7666" rel="L7666"></li>
<li class="L7667" rel="L7667">“It is all the same,” said the spy, airily, but discomfited too: “good</li>
<li class="L7668" rel="L7668">day!”</li>
<li class="L7669" rel="L7669"></li>
<li class="L7670" rel="L7670">“Good day!” answered Defarge, drily.</li>
<li class="L7671" rel="L7671"></li>
<li class="L7672" rel="L7672">“I was saying to madame, with whom I had the pleasure of chatting when</li>
<li class="L7673" rel="L7673">you entered, that they tell me there is--and no wonder!--much sympathy</li>
<li class="L7674" rel="L7674">and anger in Saint Antoine, touching the unhappy fate of poor Gaspard.”</li>
<li class="L7675" rel="L7675"></li>
<li class="L7676" rel="L7676">“No one has told me so,” said Defarge, shaking his head. “I know nothing</li>
<li class="L7677" rel="L7677">of it.”</li>
<li class="L7678" rel="L7678"></li>
<li class="L7679" rel="L7679">Having said it, he passed behind the little counter, and stood with his</li>
<li class="L7680" rel="L7680">hand on the back of his wife&#39;s chair, looking over that barrier at the</li>
<li class="L7681" rel="L7681">person to whom they were both opposed, and whom either of them would</li>
<li class="L7682" rel="L7682">have shot with the greatest satisfaction.</li>
<li class="L7683" rel="L7683"></li>
<li class="L7684" rel="L7684">The spy, well used to his business, did not change his unconscious</li>
<li class="L7685" rel="L7685">attitude, but drained his little glass of cognac, took a sip of fresh</li>
<li class="L7686" rel="L7686">water, and asked for another glass of cognac. Madame Defarge poured it</li>
<li class="L7687" rel="L7687">out for him, took to her knitting again, and hummed a little song over</li>
<li class="L7688" rel="L7688">it.</li>
<li class="L7689" rel="L7689"></li>
<li class="L7690" rel="L7690">“You seem to know this quarter well; that is to say, better than I do?”</li>
<li class="L7691" rel="L7691"> observed Defarge.</li>
<li class="L7692" rel="L7692"></li>
<li class="L7693" rel="L7693">“Not at all, but I hope to know it better. I am so profoundly interested</li>
<li class="L7694" rel="L7694">in its miserable inhabitants.”</li>
<li class="L7695" rel="L7695"></li>
<li class="L7696" rel="L7696">“Hah!” muttered Defarge.</li>
<li class="L7697" rel="L7697"></li>
<li class="L7698" rel="L7698">“The pleasure of conversing with you, Monsieur Defarge, recalls to me,”</li>
<li class="L7699" rel="L7699"> pursued the spy, “that I have the honour of cherishing some interesting</li>
<li class="L7700" rel="L7700">associations with your name.”</li>
<li class="L7701" rel="L7701"></li>
<li class="L7702" rel="L7702">“Indeed!” said Defarge, with much indifference.</li>
<li class="L7703" rel="L7703"></li>
<li class="L7704" rel="L7704">“Yes, indeed. When Doctor Manette was released, you, his old domestic,</li>
<li class="L7705" rel="L7705">had the charge of him, I know. He was delivered to you. You see I am</li>
<li class="L7706" rel="L7706">informed of the circumstances?”</li>
<li class="L7707" rel="L7707"></li>
<li class="L7708" rel="L7708">“Such is the fact, certainly,” said Defarge. He had had it conveyed</li>
<li class="L7709" rel="L7709">to him, in an accidental touch of his wife&#39;s elbow as she knitted and</li>
<li class="L7710" rel="L7710">warbled, that he would do best to answer, but always with brevity.</li>
<li class="L7711" rel="L7711"></li>
<li class="L7712" rel="L7712">“It was to you,” said the spy, “that his daughter came; and it was</li>
<li class="L7713" rel="L7713">from your care that his daughter took him, accompanied by a neat brown</li>
<li class="L7714" rel="L7714">monsieur; how is he called?--in a little wig--Lorry--of the bank of</li>
<li class="L7715" rel="L7715">Tellson and Company--over to England.”</li>
<li class="L7716" rel="L7716"></li>
<li class="L7717" rel="L7717">“Such is the fact,” repeated Defarge.</li>
<li class="L7718" rel="L7718"></li>
<li class="L7719" rel="L7719">“Very interesting remembrances!” said the spy. “I have known Doctor</li>
<li class="L7720" rel="L7720">Manette and his daughter, in England.”</li>
<li class="L7721" rel="L7721"></li>
<li class="L7722" rel="L7722">“Yes?” said Defarge.</li>
<li class="L7723" rel="L7723"></li>
<li class="L7724" rel="L7724">“You don&#39;t hear much about them now?” said the spy.</li>
<li class="L7725" rel="L7725"></li>
<li class="L7726" rel="L7726">“No,” said Defarge.</li>
<li class="L7727" rel="L7727"></li>
<li class="L7728" rel="L7728">“In effect,” madame struck in, looking up from her work and her little</li>
<li class="L7729" rel="L7729">song, “we never hear about them. We received the news of their safe</li>
<li class="L7730" rel="L7730">arrival, and perhaps another letter, or perhaps two; but, since then,</li>
<li class="L7731" rel="L7731">they have gradually taken their road in life--we, ours--and we have held</li>
<li class="L7732" rel="L7732">no correspondence.”</li>
<li class="L7733" rel="L7733"></li>
<li class="L7734" rel="L7734">“Perfectly so, madame,” replied the spy. “She is going to be married.”</li>
<li class="L7735" rel="L7735"></li>
<li class="L7736" rel="L7736">“Going?” echoed madame. “She was pretty enough to have been married long</li>
<li class="L7737" rel="L7737">ago. You English are cold, it seems to me.”</li>
<li class="L7738" rel="L7738"></li>
<li class="L7739" rel="L7739">“Oh! You know I am English.”</li>
<li class="L7740" rel="L7740"></li>
<li class="L7741" rel="L7741">“I perceive your tongue is,” returned madame; “and what the tongue is, I</li>
<li class="L7742" rel="L7742">suppose the man is.”</li>
<li class="L7743" rel="L7743"></li>
<li class="L7744" rel="L7744">He did not take the identification as a compliment; but he made the best</li>
<li class="L7745" rel="L7745">of it, and turned it off with a laugh. After sipping his cognac to the</li>
<li class="L7746" rel="L7746">end, he added:</li>
<li class="L7747" rel="L7747"></li>
<li class="L7748" rel="L7748">“Yes, Miss Manette is going to be married. But not to an Englishman; to</li>
<li class="L7749" rel="L7749">one who, like herself, is French by birth. And speaking of Gaspard (ah,</li>
<li class="L7750" rel="L7750">poor Gaspard! It was cruel, cruel!), it is a curious thing that she is</li>
<li class="L7751" rel="L7751">going to marry the nephew of Monsieur the Marquis, for whom Gaspard</li>
<li class="L7752" rel="L7752">was exalted to that height of so many feet; in other words, the present</li>
<li class="L7753" rel="L7753">Marquis. But he lives unknown in England, he is no Marquis there; he is</li>
<li class="L7754" rel="L7754">Mr. Charles Darnay. D&#39;Aulnais is the name of his mother&#39;s family.”</li>
<li class="L7755" rel="L7755"></li>
<li class="L7756" rel="L7756">Madame Defarge knitted steadily, but the intelligence had a palpable</li>
<li class="L7757" rel="L7757">effect upon her husband. Do what he would, behind the little counter,</li>
<li class="L7758" rel="L7758">as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe, he was</li>
<li class="L7759" rel="L7759">troubled, and his hand was not trustworthy. The spy would have been no</li>
<li class="L7760" rel="L7760">spy if he had failed to see it, or to record it in his mind.</li>
<li class="L7761" rel="L7761"></li>
<li class="L7762" rel="L7762">Having made, at least, this one hit, whatever it might prove to be</li>
<li class="L7763" rel="L7763">worth, and no customers coming in to help him to any other, Mr. Barsad</li>
<li class="L7764" rel="L7764">paid for what he had drunk, and took his leave: taking occasion to say,</li>
<li class="L7765" rel="L7765">in a genteel manner, before he departed, that he looked forward to the</li>
<li class="L7766" rel="L7766">pleasure of seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again. For some minutes</li>
<li class="L7767" rel="L7767">after he had emerged into the outer presence of Saint Antoine, the</li>
<li class="L7768" rel="L7768">husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them, lest he should</li>
<li class="L7769" rel="L7769">come back.</li>
<li class="L7770" rel="L7770"></li>
<li class="L7771" rel="L7771">“Can it be true,” said Defarge, in a low voice, looking down at his wife</li>
<li class="L7772" rel="L7772">as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair: “what he has</li>
<li class="L7773" rel="L7773">said of Ma&#39;amselle Manette?”</li>
<li class="L7774" rel="L7774"></li>
<li class="L7775" rel="L7775">“As he has said it,” returned madame, lifting her eyebrows a little, “it</li>
<li class="L7776" rel="L7776">is probably false. But it may be true.”</li>
<li class="L7777" rel="L7777"></li>
<li class="L7778" rel="L7778">“If it is--” Defarge began, and stopped.</li>
<li class="L7779" rel="L7779"></li>
<li class="L7780" rel="L7780">“If it is?” repeated his wife.</li>
<li class="L7781" rel="L7781"></li>
<li class="L7782" rel="L7782">“--And if it does come, while we live to see it triumph--I hope, for her</li>
<li class="L7783" rel="L7783">sake, Destiny will keep her husband out of France.”</li>
<li class="L7784" rel="L7784"></li>
<li class="L7785" rel="L7785">“Her husband&#39;s destiny,” said Madame Defarge, with her usual composure,</li>
<li class="L7786" rel="L7786">“will take him where he is to go, and will lead him to the end that is</li>
<li class="L7787" rel="L7787">to end him. That is all I know.”</li>
<li class="L7788" rel="L7788"></li>
<li class="L7789" rel="L7789">“But it is very strange--now, at least, is it not very strange”--said</li>
<li class="L7790" rel="L7790">Defarge, rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it,</li>
<li class="L7791" rel="L7791">“that, after all our sympathy for Monsieur her father, and herself, her</li>
<li class="L7792" rel="L7792">husband&#39;s name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment, by</li>
<li class="L7793" rel="L7793">the side of that infernal dog&#39;s who has just left us?”</li>
<li class="L7794" rel="L7794"></li>
<li class="L7795" rel="L7795">“Stranger things than that will happen when it does come,” answered</li>
<li class="L7796" rel="L7796">madame. “I have them both here, of a certainty; and they are both here</li>
<li class="L7797" rel="L7797">for their merits; that is enough.”</li>
<li class="L7798" rel="L7798"></li>
<li class="L7799" rel="L7799">She rolled up her knitting when she had said those words, and presently</li>
<li class="L7800" rel="L7800">took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head.</li>
<li class="L7801" rel="L7801">Either Saint Antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable</li>
<li class="L7802" rel="L7802">decoration was gone, or Saint Antoine was on the watch for its</li>
<li class="L7803" rel="L7803">disappearance; howbeit, the Saint took courage to lounge in, very</li>
<li class="L7804" rel="L7804">shortly afterwards, and the wine-shop recovered its habitual aspect.</li>
<li class="L7805" rel="L7805"></li>
<li class="L7806" rel="L7806">In the evening, at which season of all others Saint Antoine turned</li>
<li class="L7807" rel="L7807">himself inside out, and sat on door-steps and window-ledges, and came</li>
<li class="L7808" rel="L7808">to the corners of vile streets and courts, for a breath of air, Madame</li>
<li class="L7809" rel="L7809">Defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place</li>
<li class="L7810" rel="L7810">to place and from group to group: a Missionary--there were many like</li>
<li class="L7811" rel="L7811">her--such as the world will do well never to breed again. All the women</li>
<li class="L7812" rel="L7812">knitted. They knitted worthless things; but, the mechanical work was a</li>
<li class="L7813" rel="L7813">mechanical substitute for eating and drinking; the hands moved for the</li>
<li class="L7814" rel="L7814">jaws and the digestive apparatus: if the bony fingers had been still,</li>
<li class="L7815" rel="L7815">the stomachs would have been more famine-pinched.</li>
<li class="L7816" rel="L7816"></li>
<li class="L7817" rel="L7817">But, as the fingers went, the eyes went, and the thoughts. And as Madame</li>
<li class="L7818" rel="L7818">Defarge moved on from group to group, all three went quicker and fiercer</li>
<li class="L7819" rel="L7819">among every little knot of women that she had spoken with, and left</li>
<li class="L7820" rel="L7820">behind.</li>
<li class="L7821" rel="L7821"></li>
<li class="L7822" rel="L7822">Her husband smoked at his door, looking after her with admiration. “A</li>
<li class="L7823" rel="L7823">great woman,” said he, “a strong woman, a grand woman, a frightfully</li>
<li class="L7824" rel="L7824">grand woman!”</li>
<li class="L7825" rel="L7825"></li>
<li class="L7826" rel="L7826">Darkness closed around, and then came the ringing of church bells and</li>
<li class="L7827" rel="L7827">the distant beating of the military drums in the Palace Courtyard, as</li>
<li class="L7828" rel="L7828">the women sat knitting, knitting. Darkness encompassed them. Another</li>
<li class="L7829" rel="L7829">darkness was closing in as surely, when the church bells, then ringing</li>
<li class="L7830" rel="L7830">pleasantly in many an airy steeple over France, should be melted into</li>
<li class="L7831" rel="L7831">thundering cannon; when the military drums should be beating to drown a</li>
<li class="L7832" rel="L7832">wretched voice, that night all potent as the voice of Power and Plenty,</li>
<li class="L7833" rel="L7833">Freedom and Life. So much was closing in about the women who sat</li>
<li class="L7834" rel="L7834">knitting, knitting, that they their very selves were closing in around</li>
<li class="L7835" rel="L7835">a structure yet unbuilt, where they were to sit knitting, knitting,</li>
<li class="L7836" rel="L7836">counting dropping heads.</li>
<li class="L7837" rel="L7837"></li>
<li class="L7838" rel="L7838"></li>
<li class="L7839" rel="L7839"></li>
<li class="L7840" rel="L7840"></li>
<li class="L7841" rel="L7841">XVII. One Night</li>
<li class="L7842" rel="L7842"></li>
<li class="L7843" rel="L7843"></li>
<li class="L7844" rel="L7844">Never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in</li>
<li class="L7845" rel="L7845">Soho, than one memorable evening when the Doctor and his daughter sat</li>
<li class="L7846" rel="L7846">under the plane-tree together. Never did the moon rise with a milder</li>
<li class="L7847" rel="L7847">radiance over great London, than on that night when it found them still</li>
<li class="L7848" rel="L7848">seated under the tree, and shone upon their faces through its leaves.</li>
<li class="L7849" rel="L7849"></li>
<li class="L7850" rel="L7850">Lucie was to be married to-morrow. She had reserved this last evening</li>
<li class="L7851" rel="L7851">for her father, and they sat alone under the plane-tree.</li>
<li class="L7852" rel="L7852"></li>
<li class="L7853" rel="L7853">“You are happy, my dear father?”</li>
<li class="L7854" rel="L7854"></li>
<li class="L7855" rel="L7855">“Quite, my child.”</li>
<li class="L7856" rel="L7856"></li>
<li class="L7857" rel="L7857">They had said little, though they had been there a long time. When it</li>
<li class="L7858" rel="L7858">was yet light enough to work and read, she had neither engaged herself</li>
<li class="L7859" rel="L7859">in her usual work, nor had she read to him. She had employed herself in</li>
<li class="L7860" rel="L7860">both ways, at his side under the tree, many and many a time; but, this</li>
<li class="L7861" rel="L7861">time was not quite like any other, and nothing could make it so.</li>
<li class="L7862" rel="L7862"></li>
<li class="L7863" rel="L7863">“And I am very happy to-night, dear father. I am deeply happy in the</li>
<li class="L7864" rel="L7864">love that Heaven has so blessed--my love for Charles, and Charles&#39;s love</li>
<li class="L7865" rel="L7865">for me. But, if my life were not to be still consecrated to you, or</li>
<li class="L7866" rel="L7866">if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us, even by</li>
<li class="L7867" rel="L7867">the length of a few of these streets, I should be more unhappy and</li>
<li class="L7868" rel="L7868">self-reproachful now than I can tell you. Even as it is--”</li>
<li class="L7869" rel="L7869"></li>
<li class="L7870" rel="L7870">Even as it was, she could not command her voice.</li>
<li class="L7871" rel="L7871"></li>
<li class="L7872" rel="L7872">In the sad moonlight, she clasped him by the neck, and laid her face</li>
<li class="L7873" rel="L7873">upon his breast. In the moonlight which is always sad, as the light of</li>
<li class="L7874" rel="L7874">the sun itself is--as the light called human life is--at its coming and</li>
<li class="L7875" rel="L7875">its going.</li>
<li class="L7876" rel="L7876"></li>
<li class="L7877" rel="L7877">“Dearest dear! Can you tell me, this last time, that you feel quite,</li>
<li class="L7878" rel="L7878">quite sure, no new affections of mine, and no new duties of mine, will</li>
<li class="L7879" rel="L7879">ever interpose between us? _I_ know it well, but do you know it? In your</li>
<li class="L7880" rel="L7880">own heart, do you feel quite certain?”</li>
<li class="L7881" rel="L7881"></li>
<li class="L7882" rel="L7882">Her father answered, with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could</li>
<li class="L7883" rel="L7883">scarcely have assumed, “Quite sure, my darling! More than that,” he</li>
<li class="L7884" rel="L7884">added, as he tenderly kissed her: “my future is far brighter, Lucie,</li>
<li class="L7885" rel="L7885">seen through your marriage, than it could have been--nay, than it ever</li>
<li class="L7886" rel="L7886">was--without it.”</li>
<li class="L7887" rel="L7887"></li>
<li class="L7888" rel="L7888">“If I could hope _that_, my father!--”</li>
<li class="L7889" rel="L7889"></li>
<li class="L7890" rel="L7890">“Believe it, love! Indeed it is so. Consider how natural and how plain</li>
<li class="L7891" rel="L7891">it is, my dear, that it should be so. You, devoted and young, cannot</li>
<li class="L7892" rel="L7892">fully appreciate the anxiety I have felt that your life should not be</li>
<li class="L7893" rel="L7893">wasted--”</li>
<li class="L7894" rel="L7894"></li>
<li class="L7895" rel="L7895">She moved her hand towards his lips, but he took it in his, and repeated</li>
<li class="L7896" rel="L7896">the word.</li>
<li class="L7897" rel="L7897"></li>
<li class="L7898" rel="L7898">“--wasted, my child--should not be wasted, struck aside from the</li>
<li class="L7899" rel="L7899">natural order of things--for my sake. Your unselfishness cannot entirely</li>
<li class="L7900" rel="L7900">comprehend how much my mind has gone on this; but, only ask yourself,</li>
<li class="L7901" rel="L7901">how could my happiness be perfect, while yours was incomplete?”</li>
<li class="L7902" rel="L7902"></li>
<li class="L7903" rel="L7903">“If I had never seen Charles, my father, I should have been quite happy</li>
<li class="L7904" rel="L7904">with you.”</li>
<li class="L7905" rel="L7905"></li>
<li class="L7906" rel="L7906">He smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy</li>
<li class="L7907" rel="L7907">without Charles, having seen him; and replied:</li>
<li class="L7908" rel="L7908"></li>
<li class="L7909" rel="L7909">“My child, you did see him, and it is Charles. If it had not been</li>
<li class="L7910" rel="L7910">Charles, it would have been another. Or, if it had been no other, I</li>
<li class="L7911" rel="L7911">should have been the cause, and then the dark part of my life would have</li>
<li class="L7912" rel="L7912">cast its shadow beyond myself, and would have fallen on you.”</li>
<li class="L7913" rel="L7913"></li>
<li class="L7914" rel="L7914">It was the first time, except at the trial, of her ever hearing him</li>
<li class="L7915" rel="L7915">refer to the period of his suffering. It gave her a strange and new</li>
<li class="L7916" rel="L7916">sensation while his words were in her ears; and she remembered it long</li>
<li class="L7917" rel="L7917">afterwards.</li>
<li class="L7918" rel="L7918"></li>
<li class="L7919" rel="L7919">“See!” said the Doctor of Beauvais, raising his hand towards the moon.</li>
<li class="L7920" rel="L7920">“I have looked at her from my prison-window, when I could not bear her</li>
<li class="L7921" rel="L7921">light. I have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think</li>
<li class="L7922" rel="L7922">of her shining upon what I had lost, that I have beaten my head against</li>
<li class="L7923" rel="L7923">my prison-walls. I have looked at her, in a state so dull and lethargic,</li>
<li class="L7924" rel="L7924">that I have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines I</li>
<li class="L7925" rel="L7925">could draw across her at the full, and the number of perpendicular lines</li>
<li class="L7926" rel="L7926">with which I could intersect them.” He added in his inward and pondering</li>
<li class="L7927" rel="L7927">manner, as he looked at the moon, “It was twenty either way, I remember,</li>
<li class="L7928" rel="L7928">and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in.”</li>
<li class="L7929" rel="L7929"></li>
<li class="L7930" rel="L7930">The strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time,</li>
<li class="L7931" rel="L7931">deepened as he dwelt upon it; but, there was nothing to shock her in</li>
<li class="L7932" rel="L7932">the manner of his reference. He only seemed to contrast his present</li>
<li class="L7933" rel="L7933">cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over.</li>
<li class="L7934" rel="L7934"></li>
<li class="L7935" rel="L7935">“I have looked at her, speculating thousands of times upon the unborn</li>
<li class="L7936" rel="L7936">child from whom I had been rent. Whether it was alive. Whether it had</li>
<li class="L7937" rel="L7937">been born alive, or the poor mother&#39;s shock had killed it. Whether it</li>
<li class="L7938" rel="L7938">was a son who would some day avenge his father. (There was a time in my</li>
<li class="L7939" rel="L7939">imprisonment, when my desire for vengeance was unbearable.) Whether it</li>
<li class="L7940" rel="L7940">was a son who would never know his father&#39;s story; who might even live</li>
<li class="L7941" rel="L7941">to weigh the possibility of his father&#39;s having disappeared of his own</li>
<li class="L7942" rel="L7942">will and act. Whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman.”</li>
<li class="L7943" rel="L7943"></li>
<li class="L7944" rel="L7944">She drew closer to him, and kissed his cheek and his hand.</li>
<li class="L7945" rel="L7945"></li>
<li class="L7946" rel="L7946">“I have pictured my daughter, to myself, as perfectly forgetful of</li>
<li class="L7947" rel="L7947">me--rather, altogether ignorant of me, and unconscious of me. I have</li>
<li class="L7948" rel="L7948">cast up the years of her age, year after year. I have seen her married</li>
<li class="L7949" rel="L7949">to a man who knew nothing of my fate. I have altogether perished from</li>
<li class="L7950" rel="L7950">the remembrance of the living, and in the next generation my place was a</li>
<li class="L7951" rel="L7951">blank.”</li>
<li class="L7952" rel="L7952"></li>
<li class="L7953" rel="L7953">“My father! Even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who</li>
<li class="L7954" rel="L7954">never existed, strikes to my heart as if I had been that child.”</li>
<li class="L7955" rel="L7955"></li>
<li class="L7956" rel="L7956">“You, Lucie? It is out of the Consolation and restoration you have</li>
<li class="L7957" rel="L7957">brought to me, that these remembrances arise, and pass between us and</li>
<li class="L7958" rel="L7958">the moon on this last night.--What did I say just now?”</li>
<li class="L7959" rel="L7959"></li>
<li class="L7960" rel="L7960">“She knew nothing of you. She cared nothing for you.”</li>
<li class="L7961" rel="L7961"></li>
<li class="L7962" rel="L7962">“So! But on other moonlight nights, when the sadness and the silence</li>
<li class="L7963" rel="L7963">have touched me in a different way--have affected me with something as</li>
<li class="L7964" rel="L7964">like a sorrowful sense of peace, as any emotion that had pain for its</li>
<li class="L7965" rel="L7965">foundations could--I have imagined her as coming to me in my cell, and</li>
<li class="L7966" rel="L7966">leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress. I have seen her</li>
<li class="L7967" rel="L7967">image in the moonlight often, as I now see you; except that I never held</li>
<li class="L7968" rel="L7968">her in my arms; it stood between the little grated window and the door.</li>
<li class="L7969" rel="L7969">But, you understand that that was not the child I am speaking of?”</li>
<li class="L7970" rel="L7970"></li>
<li class="L7971" rel="L7971">“The figure was not; the--the--image; the fancy?”</li>
<li class="L7972" rel="L7972"></li>
<li class="L7973" rel="L7973">“No. That was another thing. It stood before my disturbed sense of</li>
<li class="L7974" rel="L7974">sight, but it never moved. The phantom that my mind pursued, was another</li>
<li class="L7975" rel="L7975">and more real child. Of her outward appearance I know no more than</li>
<li class="L7976" rel="L7976">that she was like her mother. The other had that likeness too--as you</li>
<li class="L7977" rel="L7977">have--but was not the same. Can you follow me, Lucie? Hardly, I think?</li>
<li class="L7978" rel="L7978">I doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these</li>
<li class="L7979" rel="L7979">perplexed distinctions.”</li>
<li class="L7980" rel="L7980"></li>
<li class="L7981" rel="L7981">His collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running</li>
<li class="L7982" rel="L7982">cold, as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition.</li>
<li class="L7983" rel="L7983"></li>
<li class="L7984" rel="L7984">“In that more peaceful state, I have imagined her, in the moonlight,</li>
<li class="L7985" rel="L7985">coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married</li>
<li class="L7986" rel="L7986">life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father. My picture</li>
<li class="L7987" rel="L7987">was in her room, and I was in her prayers. Her life was active,</li>
<li class="L7988" rel="L7988">cheerful, useful; but my poor history pervaded it all.”</li>
<li class="L7989" rel="L7989"></li>
<li class="L7990" rel="L7990">“I was that child, my father, I was not half so good, but in my love</li>
<li class="L7991" rel="L7991">that was I.”</li>
<li class="L7992" rel="L7992"></li>
<li class="L7993" rel="L7993">“And she showed me her children,” said the Doctor of Beauvais, “and</li>
<li class="L7994" rel="L7994">they had heard of me, and had been taught to pity me. When they passed</li>
<li class="L7995" rel="L7995">a prison of the State, they kept far from its frowning walls, and looked</li>
<li class="L7996" rel="L7996">up at its bars, and spoke in whispers. She could never deliver me; I</li>
<li class="L7997" rel="L7997">imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things.</li>
<li class="L7998" rel="L7998">But then, blessed with the relief of tears, I fell upon my knees, and</li>
<li class="L7999" rel="L7999">blessed her.”</li>
<li class="L8000" rel="L8000"></li>
<li class="L8001" rel="L8001">“I am that child, I hope, my father. O my dear, my dear, will you bless</li>
<li class="L8002" rel="L8002">me as fervently to-morrow?”</li>
<li class="L8003" rel="L8003"></li>
<li class="L8004" rel="L8004">“Lucie, I recall these old troubles in the reason that I have to-night</li>
<li class="L8005" rel="L8005">for loving you better than words can tell, and thanking God for my great</li>
<li class="L8006" rel="L8006">happiness. My thoughts, when they were wildest, never rose near the</li>
<li class="L8007" rel="L8007">happiness that I have known with you, and that we have before us.”</li>
<li class="L8008" rel="L8008"></li>
<li class="L8009" rel="L8009">He embraced her, solemnly commended her to Heaven, and humbly thanked</li>
<li class="L8010" rel="L8010">Heaven for having bestowed her on him. By-and-bye, they went into the</li>
<li class="L8011" rel="L8011">house.</li>
<li class="L8012" rel="L8012"></li>
<li class="L8013" rel="L8013">There was no one bidden to the marriage but Mr. Lorry; there was even to</li>
<li class="L8014" rel="L8014">be no bridesmaid but the gaunt Miss Pross. The marriage was to make no</li>
<li class="L8015" rel="L8015">change in their place of residence; they had been able to extend it,</li>
<li class="L8016" rel="L8016">by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the</li>
<li class="L8017" rel="L8017">apocryphal invisible lodger, and they desired nothing more.</li>
<li class="L8018" rel="L8018"></li>
<li class="L8019" rel="L8019">Doctor Manette was very cheerful at the little supper. They were only</li>
<li class="L8020" rel="L8020">three at table, and Miss Pross made the third. He regretted that Charles</li>
<li class="L8021" rel="L8021">was not there; was more than half disposed to object to the loving</li>
<li class="L8022" rel="L8022">little plot that kept him away; and drank to him affectionately.</li>
<li class="L8023" rel="L8023"></li>
<li class="L8024" rel="L8024">So, the time came for him to bid Lucie good night, and they separated.</li>
<li class="L8025" rel="L8025">But, in the stillness of the third hour of the morning, Lucie came</li>
<li class="L8026" rel="L8026">downstairs again, and stole into his room; not free from unshaped fears,</li>
<li class="L8027" rel="L8027">beforehand.</li>
<li class="L8028" rel="L8028"></li>
<li class="L8029" rel="L8029">All things, however, were in their places; all was quiet; and he lay</li>
<li class="L8030" rel="L8030">asleep, his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow, and his</li>
<li class="L8031" rel="L8031">hands lying quiet on the coverlet. She put her needless candle in the</li>
<li class="L8032" rel="L8032">shadow at a distance, crept up to his bed, and put her lips to his;</li>
<li class="L8033" rel="L8033">then, leaned over him, and looked at him.</li>
<li class="L8034" rel="L8034"></li>
<li class="L8035" rel="L8035">Into his handsome face, the bitter waters of captivity had worn; but, he</li>
<li class="L8036" rel="L8036">covered up their tracks with a determination so strong, that he held the</li>
<li class="L8037" rel="L8037">mastery of them even in his sleep. A more remarkable face in its quiet,</li>
<li class="L8038" rel="L8038">resolute, and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant, was not to be</li>
<li class="L8039" rel="L8039">beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep, that night.</li>
<li class="L8040" rel="L8040"></li>
<li class="L8041" rel="L8041">She timidly laid her hand on his dear breast, and put up a prayer that</li>
<li class="L8042" rel="L8042">she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be, and as his</li>
<li class="L8043" rel="L8043">sorrows deserved. Then, she withdrew her hand, and kissed his lips once</li>
<li class="L8044" rel="L8044">more, and went away. So, the sunrise came, and the shadows of the leaves</li>
<li class="L8045" rel="L8045">of the plane-tree moved upon his face, as softly as her lips had moved</li>
<li class="L8046" rel="L8046">in praying for him.</li>
<li class="L8047" rel="L8047"></li>
<li class="L8048" rel="L8048"></li>
<li class="L8049" rel="L8049"></li>
<li class="L8050" rel="L8050"></li>
<li class="L8051" rel="L8051">XVIII. Nine Days</li>
<li class="L8052" rel="L8052"></li>
<li class="L8053" rel="L8053"></li>
<li class="L8054" rel="L8054">The marriage-day was shining brightly, and they were ready outside the</li>
<li class="L8055" rel="L8055">closed door of the Doctor&#39;s room, where he was speaking with Charles</li>
<li class="L8056" rel="L8056">Darnay. They were ready to go to church; the beautiful bride, Mr.</li>
<li class="L8057" rel="L8057">Lorry, and Miss Pross--to whom the event, through a gradual process of</li>
<li class="L8058" rel="L8058">reconcilement to the inevitable, would have been one of absolute bliss,</li>
<li class="L8059" rel="L8059">but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother Solomon should</li>
<li class="L8060" rel="L8060">have been the bridegroom.</li>
<li class="L8061" rel="L8061"></li>
<li class="L8062" rel="L8062">“And so,” said Mr. Lorry, who could not sufficiently admire the bride,</li>
<li class="L8063" rel="L8063">and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet,</li>
<li class="L8064" rel="L8064">pretty dress; “and so it was for this, my sweet Lucie, that I brought</li>
<li class="L8065" rel="L8065">you across the Channel, such a baby! Lord bless me! How little I thought</li>
<li class="L8066" rel="L8066">what I was doing! How lightly I valued the obligation I was conferring</li>
<li class="L8067" rel="L8067">on my friend Mr. Charles!”</li>
<li class="L8068" rel="L8068"></li>
<li class="L8069" rel="L8069">“You didn&#39;t mean it,” remarked the matter-of-fact Miss Pross, “and</li>
<li class="L8070" rel="L8070">therefore how could you know it? Nonsense!”</li>
<li class="L8071" rel="L8071"></li>
<li class="L8072" rel="L8072">“Really? Well; but don&#39;t cry,” said the gentle Mr. Lorry.</li>
<li class="L8073" rel="L8073"></li>
<li class="L8074" rel="L8074">“I am not crying,” said Miss Pross; “_you_ are.”</li>
<li class="L8075" rel="L8075"></li>
<li class="L8076" rel="L8076">“I, my Pross?” (By this time, Mr. Lorry dared to be pleasant with her,</li>
<li class="L8077" rel="L8077">on occasion.)</li>
<li class="L8078" rel="L8078"></li>
<li class="L8079" rel="L8079">“You were, just now; I saw you do it, and I don&#39;t wonder at it. Such</li>
<li class="L8080" rel="L8080">a present of plate as you have made &#39;em, is enough to bring tears into</li>
<li class="L8081" rel="L8081">anybody&#39;s eyes. There&#39;s not a fork or a spoon in the collection,” said</li>
<li class="L8082" rel="L8082">Miss Pross, “that I didn&#39;t cry over, last night after the box came, till</li>
<li class="L8083" rel="L8083">I couldn&#39;t see it.”</li>
<li class="L8084" rel="L8084"></li>
<li class="L8085" rel="L8085">“I am highly gratified,” said Mr. Lorry, “though, upon my honour, I</li>
<li class="L8086" rel="L8086">had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance</li>
<li class="L8087" rel="L8087">invisible to any one. Dear me! This is an occasion that makes a man</li>
<li class="L8088" rel="L8088">speculate on all he has lost. Dear, dear, dear! To think that there</li>
<li class="L8089" rel="L8089">might have been a Mrs. Lorry, any time these fifty years almost!”</li>
<li class="L8090" rel="L8090"></li>
<li class="L8091" rel="L8091">“Not at all!” From Miss Pross.</li>
<li class="L8092" rel="L8092"></li>
<li class="L8093" rel="L8093">“You think there never might have been a Mrs. Lorry?” asked the</li>
<li class="L8094" rel="L8094">gentleman of that name.</li>
<li class="L8095" rel="L8095"></li>
<li class="L8096" rel="L8096">“Pooh!” rejoined Miss Pross; “you were a bachelor in your cradle.”</li>
<li class="L8097" rel="L8097"></li>
<li class="L8098" rel="L8098">“Well!” observed Mr. Lorry, beamingly adjusting his little wig, “that</li>
<li class="L8099" rel="L8099">seems probable, too.”</li>
<li class="L8100" rel="L8100"></li>
<li class="L8101" rel="L8101">“And you were cut out for a bachelor,” pursued Miss Pross, “before you</li>
<li class="L8102" rel="L8102">were put in your cradle.”</li>
<li class="L8103" rel="L8103"></li>
<li class="L8104" rel="L8104">“Then, I think,” said Mr. Lorry, “that I was very unhandsomely dealt</li>
<li class="L8105" rel="L8105">with, and that I ought to have had a voice in the selection of my</li>
<li class="L8106" rel="L8106">pattern. Enough! Now, my dear Lucie,” drawing his arm soothingly round</li>
<li class="L8107" rel="L8107">her waist, “I hear them moving in the next room, and Miss Pross and</li>
<li class="L8108" rel="L8108">I, as two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose the final</li>
<li class="L8109" rel="L8109">opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear. You leave</li>
<li class="L8110" rel="L8110">your good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving as your</li>
<li class="L8111" rel="L8111">own; he shall be taken every conceivable care of; during the next</li>
<li class="L8112" rel="L8112">fortnight, while you are in Warwickshire and thereabouts, even Tellson&#39;s</li>
<li class="L8113" rel="L8113">shall go to the wall (comparatively speaking) before him. And when, at</li>
<li class="L8114" rel="L8114">the fortnight&#39;s end, he comes to join you and your beloved husband, on</li>
<li class="L8115" rel="L8115">your other fortnight&#39;s trip in Wales, you shall say that we have sent</li>
<li class="L8116" rel="L8116">him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame. Now, I hear</li>
<li class="L8117" rel="L8117">Somebody&#39;s step coming to the door. Let me kiss my dear girl with an</li>
<li class="L8118" rel="L8118">old-fashioned bachelor blessing, before Somebody comes to claim his</li>
<li class="L8119" rel="L8119">own.”</li>
<li class="L8120" rel="L8120"></li>
<li class="L8121" rel="L8121">For a moment, he held the fair face from him to look at the</li>
<li class="L8122" rel="L8122">well-remembered expression on the forehead, and then laid the bright</li>
<li class="L8123" rel="L8123">golden hair against his little brown wig, with a genuine tenderness and</li>
<li class="L8124" rel="L8124">delicacy which, if such things be old-fashioned, were as old as Adam.</li>
<li class="L8125" rel="L8125"></li>
<li class="L8126" rel="L8126">The door of the Doctor&#39;s room opened, and he came out with Charles</li>
<li class="L8127" rel="L8127">Darnay. He was so deadly pale--which had not been the case when they</li>
<li class="L8128" rel="L8128">went in together--that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face.</li>
<li class="L8129" rel="L8129">But, in the composure of his manner he was unaltered, except that to the</li>
<li class="L8130" rel="L8130">shrewd glance of Mr. Lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the</li>
<li class="L8131" rel="L8131">old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him, like a cold</li>
<li class="L8132" rel="L8132">wind.</li>
<li class="L8133" rel="L8133"></li>
<li class="L8134" rel="L8134">He gave his arm to his daughter, and took her down-stairs to the chariot</li>
<li class="L8135" rel="L8135">which Mr. Lorry had hired in honour of the day. The rest followed in</li>
<li class="L8136" rel="L8136">another carriage, and soon, in a neighbouring church, where no strange</li>
<li class="L8137" rel="L8137">eyes looked on, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married.</li>
<li class="L8138" rel="L8138"></li>
<li class="L8139" rel="L8139">Besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little</li>
<li class="L8140" rel="L8140">group when it was done, some diamonds, very bright and sparkling,</li>
<li class="L8141" rel="L8141">glanced on the bride&#39;s hand, which were newly released from the</li>
<li class="L8142" rel="L8142">dark obscurity of one of Mr. Lorry&#39;s pockets. They returned home to</li>
<li class="L8143" rel="L8143">breakfast, and all went well, and in due course the golden hair that had</li>
<li class="L8144" rel="L8144">mingled with the poor shoemaker&#39;s white locks in the Paris garret, were</li>
<li class="L8145" rel="L8145">mingled with them again in the morning sunlight, on the threshold of the</li>
<li class="L8146" rel="L8146">door at parting.</li>
<li class="L8147" rel="L8147"></li>
<li class="L8148" rel="L8148">It was a hard parting, though it was not for long. But her father</li>
<li class="L8149" rel="L8149">cheered her, and said at last, gently disengaging himself from her</li>
<li class="L8150" rel="L8150">enfolding arms, “Take her, Charles! She is yours!”</li>
<li class="L8151" rel="L8151"></li>
<li class="L8152" rel="L8152">And her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and she was</li>
<li class="L8153" rel="L8153">gone.</li>
<li class="L8154" rel="L8154"></li>
<li class="L8155" rel="L8155">The corner being out of the way of the idle and curious, and the</li>
<li class="L8156" rel="L8156">preparations having been very simple and few, the Doctor, Mr. Lorry,</li>
<li class="L8157" rel="L8157">and Miss Pross, were left quite alone. It was when they turned into</li>
<li class="L8158" rel="L8158">the welcome shade of the cool old hall, that Mr. Lorry observed a great</li>
<li class="L8159" rel="L8159">change to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted</li>
<li class="L8160" rel="L8160">there, had struck him a poisoned blow.</li>
<li class="L8161" rel="L8161"></li>
<li class="L8162" rel="L8162">He had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have been</li>
<li class="L8163" rel="L8163">expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone. But, it was</li>
<li class="L8164" rel="L8164">the old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry; and through his absent</li>
<li class="L8165" rel="L8165">manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own</li>
<li class="L8166" rel="L8166">room when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of Defarge the</li>
<li class="L8167" rel="L8167">wine-shop keeper, and the starlight ride.</li>
<li class="L8168" rel="L8168"></li>
<li class="L8169" rel="L8169">“I think,” he whispered to Miss Pross, after anxious consideration, “I</li>
<li class="L8170" rel="L8170">think we had best not speak to him just now, or at all disturb him.</li>
<li class="L8171" rel="L8171">I must look in at Tellson&#39;s; so I will go there at once and come back</li>
<li class="L8172" rel="L8172">presently. Then, we will take him a ride into the country, and dine</li>
<li class="L8173" rel="L8173">there, and all will be well.”</li>
<li class="L8174" rel="L8174"></li>
<li class="L8175" rel="L8175">It was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson&#39;s, than to look out of</li>
<li class="L8176" rel="L8176">Tellson&#39;s. He was detained two hours. When he came back, he ascended the</li>
<li class="L8177" rel="L8177">old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; going thus</li>
<li class="L8178" rel="L8178">into the Doctor&#39;s rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of knocking.</li>
<li class="L8179" rel="L8179"></li>
<li class="L8180" rel="L8180">“Good God!” he said, with a start. “What&#39;s that?”</li>
<li class="L8181" rel="L8181"></li>
<li class="L8182" rel="L8182">Miss Pross, with a terrified face, was at his ear. “O me, O me! All is</li>
<li class="L8183" rel="L8183">lost!” cried she, wringing her hands. “What is to be told to Ladybird?</li>
<li class="L8184" rel="L8184">He doesn&#39;t know me, and is making shoes!”</li>
<li class="L8185" rel="L8185"></li>
<li class="L8186" rel="L8186">Mr. Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the</li>
<li class="L8187" rel="L8187">Doctor&#39;s room. The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been</li>
<li class="L8188" rel="L8188">when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent</li>
<li class="L8189" rel="L8189">down, and he was very busy.</li>
<li class="L8190" rel="L8190"></li>
<li class="L8191" rel="L8191">“Doctor Manette. My dear friend, Doctor Manette!”</li>
<li class="L8192" rel="L8192"></li>
<li class="L8193" rel="L8193">The Doctor looked at him for a moment--half inquiringly, half as if he</li>
<li class="L8194" rel="L8194">were angry at being spoken to--and bent over his work again.</li>
<li class="L8195" rel="L8195"></li>
<li class="L8196" rel="L8196">He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the</li>
<li class="L8197" rel="L8197">throat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old</li>
<li class="L8198" rel="L8198">haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him. He worked</li>
<li class="L8199" rel="L8199">hard--impatiently--as if in some sense of having been interrupted.</li>
<li class="L8200" rel="L8200"></li>
<li class="L8201" rel="L8201">Mr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was a</li>
<li class="L8202" rel="L8202">shoe of the old size and shape. He took up another that was lying by</li>
<li class="L8203" rel="L8203">him, and asked what it was.</li>
<li class="L8204" rel="L8204"></li>
<li class="L8205" rel="L8205">“A young lady&#39;s walking shoe,” he muttered, without looking up. “It</li>
<li class="L8206" rel="L8206">ought to have been finished long ago. Let it be.”</li>
<li class="L8207" rel="L8207"></li>
<li class="L8208" rel="L8208">“But, Doctor Manette. Look at me!”</li>
<li class="L8209" rel="L8209"></li>
<li class="L8210" rel="L8210">He obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in</li>
<li class="L8211" rel="L8211">his work.</li>
<li class="L8212" rel="L8212"></li>
<li class="L8213" rel="L8213">“You know me, my dear friend? Think again. This is not your proper</li>
<li class="L8214" rel="L8214">occupation. Think, dear friend!”</li>
<li class="L8215" rel="L8215"></li>
<li class="L8216" rel="L8216">Nothing would induce him to speak more. He looked up, for an instant at</li>
<li class="L8217" rel="L8217">a time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract</li>
<li class="L8218" rel="L8218">a word from him. He worked, and worked, and worked, in silence, and</li>
<li class="L8219" rel="L8219">words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on</li>
<li class="L8220" rel="L8220">the air. The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could discover, was, that</li>
<li class="L8221" rel="L8221">he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked. In that, there</li>
<li class="L8222" rel="L8222">seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity--as though he were</li>
<li class="L8223" rel="L8223">trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind.</li>
<li class="L8224" rel="L8224"></li>
<li class="L8225" rel="L8225">Two things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry, as important above</li>
<li class="L8226" rel="L8226">all others; the first, that this must be kept secret from Lucie;</li>
<li class="L8227" rel="L8227">the second, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him. In</li>
<li class="L8228" rel="L8228">conjunction with Miss Pross, he took immediate steps towards the latter</li>
<li class="L8229" rel="L8229">precaution, by giving out that the Doctor was not well, and required a</li>
<li class="L8230" rel="L8230">few days of complete rest. In aid of the kind deception to be practised</li>
<li class="L8231" rel="L8231">on his daughter, Miss Pross was to write, describing his having been</li>
<li class="L8232" rel="L8232">called away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of</li>
<li class="L8233" rel="L8233">two or three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been</li>
<li class="L8234" rel="L8234">addressed to her by the same post.</li>
<li class="L8235" rel="L8235"></li>
<li class="L8236" rel="L8236">These measures, advisable to be taken in any case, Mr. Lorry took in</li>
<li class="L8237" rel="L8237">the hope of his coming to himself. If that should happen soon, he kept</li>
<li class="L8238" rel="L8238">another course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that he</li>
<li class="L8239" rel="L8239">thought the best, on the Doctor&#39;s case.</li>
<li class="L8240" rel="L8240"></li>
<li class="L8241" rel="L8241">In the hope of his recovery, and of resort to this third course</li>
<li class="L8242" rel="L8242">being thereby rendered practicable, Mr. Lorry resolved to watch him</li>
<li class="L8243" rel="L8243">attentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so. He</li>
<li class="L8244" rel="L8244">therefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellson&#39;s for the</li>
<li class="L8245" rel="L8245">first time in his life, and took his post by the window in the same</li>
<li class="L8246" rel="L8246">room.</li>
<li class="L8247" rel="L8247"></li>
<li class="L8248" rel="L8248">He was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak</li>
<li class="L8249" rel="L8249">to him, since, on being pressed, he became worried. He abandoned that</li>
<li class="L8250" rel="L8250">attempt on the first day, and resolved merely to keep himself always</li>
<li class="L8251" rel="L8251">before him, as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had</li>
<li class="L8252" rel="L8252">fallen, or was falling. He remained, therefore, in his seat near the</li>
<li class="L8253" rel="L8253">window, reading and writing, and expressing in as many pleasant and</li>
<li class="L8254" rel="L8254">natural ways as he could think of, that it was a free place.</li>
<li class="L8255" rel="L8255"></li>
<li class="L8256" rel="L8256">Doctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink, and worked on,</li>
<li class="L8257" rel="L8257">that first day, until it was too dark to see--worked on, half an hour</li>
<li class="L8258" rel="L8258">after Mr. Lorry could not have seen, for his life, to read or write.</li>
<li class="L8259" rel="L8259">When he put his tools aside as useless, until morning, Mr. Lorry rose</li>
<li class="L8260" rel="L8260">and said to him:</li>
<li class="L8261" rel="L8261"></li>
<li class="L8262" rel="L8262">“Will you go out?”</li>
<li class="L8263" rel="L8263"></li>
<li class="L8264" rel="L8264">He looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner,</li>
<li class="L8265" rel="L8265">looked up in the old manner, and repeated in the old low voice:</li>
<li class="L8266" rel="L8266"></li>
<li class="L8267" rel="L8267">“Out?”</li>
<li class="L8268" rel="L8268"></li>
<li class="L8269" rel="L8269">“Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?”</li>
<li class="L8270" rel="L8270"></li>
<li class="L8271" rel="L8271">He made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more. But, Mr.</li>
<li class="L8272" rel="L8272">Lorry thought he saw, as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk,</li>
<li class="L8273" rel="L8273">with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, that he was in</li>
<li class="L8274" rel="L8274">some misty way asking himself, “Why not?” The sagacity of the man of</li>
<li class="L8275" rel="L8275">business perceived an advantage here, and determined to hold it.</li>
<li class="L8276" rel="L8276"></li>
<li class="L8277" rel="L8277">Miss Pross and he divided the night into two watches, and observed him</li>
<li class="L8278" rel="L8278">at intervals from the adjoining room. He paced up and down for a long</li>
<li class="L8279" rel="L8279">time before he lay down; but, when he did finally lay himself down, he</li>
<li class="L8280" rel="L8280">fell asleep. In the morning, he was up betimes, and went straight to his</li>
<li class="L8281" rel="L8281">bench and to work.</li>
<li class="L8282" rel="L8282"></li>
<li class="L8283" rel="L8283">On this second day, Mr. Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name,</li>
<li class="L8284" rel="L8284">and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them. He</li>
<li class="L8285" rel="L8285">returned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was said, and</li>
<li class="L8286" rel="L8286">that he thought about it, however confusedly. This encouraged Mr. Lorry</li>
<li class="L8287" rel="L8287">to have Miss Pross in with her work, several times during the day;</li>
<li class="L8288" rel="L8288">at those times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her father then</li>
<li class="L8289" rel="L8289">present, precisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing</li>
<li class="L8290" rel="L8290">amiss. This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long</li>
<li class="L8291" rel="L8291">enough, or often enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr. Lorry&#39;s</li>
<li class="L8292" rel="L8292">friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he</li>
<li class="L8293" rel="L8293">appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding</li>
<li class="L8294" rel="L8294">him.</li>
<li class="L8295" rel="L8295"></li>
<li class="L8296" rel="L8296">When it fell dark again, Mr. Lorry asked him as before:</li>
<li class="L8297" rel="L8297"></li>
<li class="L8298" rel="L8298">“Dear Doctor, will you go out?”</li>
<li class="L8299" rel="L8299"></li>
<li class="L8300" rel="L8300">As before, he repeated, “Out?”</li>
<li class="L8301" rel="L8301"></li>
<li class="L8302" rel="L8302">“Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?”</li>
<li class="L8303" rel="L8303"></li>
<li class="L8304" rel="L8304">This time, Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer</li>
<li class="L8305" rel="L8305">from him, and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned. In the</li>
<li class="L8306" rel="L8306">meanwhile, the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window, and had</li>
<li class="L8307" rel="L8307">sat there looking down at the plane-tree; but, on Mr. Lorry&#39;s return, he</li>
<li class="L8308" rel="L8308">slipped away to his bench.</li>
<li class="L8309" rel="L8309"></li>
<li class="L8310" rel="L8310">The time went very slowly on, and Mr. Lorry&#39;s hope darkened, and his</li>
<li class="L8311" rel="L8311">heart grew heavier again, and grew yet heavier and heavier every day.</li>
<li class="L8312" rel="L8312">The third day came and went, the fourth, the fifth. Five days, six days,</li>
<li class="L8313" rel="L8313">seven days, eight days, nine days.</li>
<li class="L8314" rel="L8314"></li>
<li class="L8315" rel="L8315">With a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing heavier and</li>
<li class="L8316" rel="L8316">heavier, Mr. Lorry passed through this anxious time. The secret was</li>
<li class="L8317" rel="L8317">well kept, and Lucie was unconscious and happy; but he could not fail to</li>
<li class="L8318" rel="L8318">observe that the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out at first,</li>
<li class="L8319" rel="L8319">was growing dreadfully skilful, and that he had never been so intent on</li>
<li class="L8320" rel="L8320">his work, and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert, as in</li>
<li class="L8321" rel="L8321">the dusk of the ninth evening.</li>
<li class="L8322" rel="L8322"></li>
<li class="L8323" rel="L8323"></li>
<li class="L8324" rel="L8324"></li>
<li class="L8325" rel="L8325"></li>
<li class="L8326" rel="L8326">XIX. An Opinion</li>
<li class="L8327" rel="L8327"></li>
<li class="L8328" rel="L8328"></li>
<li class="L8329" rel="L8329">Worn out by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post. On the</li>
<li class="L8330" rel="L8330">tenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun</li>
<li class="L8331" rel="L8331">into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark</li>
<li class="L8332" rel="L8332">night.</li>
<li class="L8333" rel="L8333"></li>
<li class="L8334" rel="L8334">He rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he had</li>
<li class="L8335" rel="L8335">done so, whether he was not still asleep. For, going to the door of the</li>
<li class="L8336" rel="L8336">Doctor&#39;s room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker&#39;s bench</li>
<li class="L8337" rel="L8337">and tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading</li>
<li class="L8338" rel="L8338">at the window. He was in his usual morning dress, and his face (which</li>
<li class="L8339" rel="L8339">Mr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly</li>
<li class="L8340" rel="L8340">studious and attentive.</li>
<li class="L8341" rel="L8341"></li>
<li class="L8342" rel="L8342">Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt</li>
<li class="L8343" rel="L8343">giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might</li>
<li class="L8344" rel="L8344">not be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his</li>
<li class="L8345" rel="L8345">friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed</li>
<li class="L8346" rel="L8346">as usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of</li>
<li class="L8347" rel="L8347">which he had so strong an impression had actually happened?</li>
<li class="L8348" rel="L8348"></li>
<li class="L8349" rel="L8349">It was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the</li>
<li class="L8350" rel="L8350">answer being obvious. If the impression were not produced by a real</li>
<li class="L8351" rel="L8351">corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there?</li>
<li class="L8352" rel="L8352">How came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor</li>
<li class="L8353" rel="L8353">Manette&#39;s consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the</li>
<li class="L8354" rel="L8354">Doctor&#39;s bedroom door in the early morning?</li>
<li class="L8355" rel="L8355"></li>
<li class="L8356" rel="L8356">Within a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side. If he</li>
<li class="L8357" rel="L8357">had had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have</li>
<li class="L8358" rel="L8358">resolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none.</li>
<li class="L8359" rel="L8359">He advised that they should let the time go by until the regular</li>
<li class="L8360" rel="L8360">breakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual</li>
<li class="L8361" rel="L8361">had occurred. If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr.</li>
<li class="L8362" rel="L8362">Lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from</li>
<li class="L8363" rel="L8363">the opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.</li>
<li class="L8364" rel="L8364"></li>
<li class="L8365" rel="L8365">Miss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was worked</li>
<li class="L8366" rel="L8366">out with care. Having abundance of time for his usual methodical</li>
<li class="L8367" rel="L8367">toilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual</li>
<li class="L8368" rel="L8368">white linen, and with his usual neat leg. The Doctor was summoned in the</li>
<li class="L8369" rel="L8369">usual way, and came to breakfast.</li>
<li class="L8370" rel="L8370"></li>
<li class="L8371" rel="L8371">So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those</li>
<li class="L8372" rel="L8372">delicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe</li>
<li class="L8373" rel="L8373">advance, he at first supposed that his daughter&#39;s marriage had taken</li>
<li class="L8374" rel="L8374">place yesterday. An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to</li>
<li class="L8375" rel="L8375">the day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and</li>
<li class="L8376" rel="L8376">counting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other respects, however,</li>
<li class="L8377" rel="L8377">he was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid</li>
<li class="L8378" rel="L8378">he sought. And that aid was his own.</li>
<li class="L8379" rel="L8379"></li>
<li class="L8380" rel="L8380">Therefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he and the</li>
<li class="L8381" rel="L8381">Doctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly:</li>
<li class="L8382" rel="L8382"></li>
<li class="L8383" rel="L8383">“My dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a</li>
<li class="L8384" rel="L8384">very curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to say, it is</li>
<li class="L8385" rel="L8385">very curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less</li>
<li class="L8386" rel="L8386">so.”</li>
<li class="L8387" rel="L8387"></li>
<li class="L8388" rel="L8388">Glancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the</li>
<li class="L8389" rel="L8389">Doctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. He had already glanced</li>
<li class="L8390" rel="L8390">at his hands more than once.</li>
<li class="L8391" rel="L8391"></li>
<li class="L8392" rel="L8392">“Doctor Manette,” said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on the</li>
<li class="L8393" rel="L8393">arm, “the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. Pray</li>
<li class="L8394" rel="L8394">give your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake--and above all,</li>
<li class="L8395" rel="L8395">for his daughter&#39;s--his daughter&#39;s, my dear Manette.”</li>
<li class="L8396" rel="L8396"></li>
<li class="L8397" rel="L8397">“If I understand,” said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, “some mental</li>
<li class="L8398" rel="L8398">shock--?”</li>
<li class="L8399" rel="L8399"></li>
<li class="L8400" rel="L8400">“Yes!”</li>
<li class="L8401" rel="L8401"></li>
<li class="L8402" rel="L8402">“Be explicit,” said the Doctor. “Spare no detail.”</li>
<li class="L8403" rel="L8403"></li>
<li class="L8404" rel="L8404">Mr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.</li>
<li class="L8405" rel="L8405"></li>
<li class="L8406" rel="L8406">“My dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock,</li>
<li class="L8407" rel="L8407">of great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings,</li>
<li class="L8408" rel="L8408">the--the--as you express it--the mind. The mind. It is the case of a</li>
<li class="L8409" rel="L8409">shock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how</li>
<li class="L8410" rel="L8410">long, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there</li>
<li class="L8411" rel="L8411">are no other means of getting at it. It is the case of a shock from</li>
<li class="L8412" rel="L8412">which the sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace</li>
<li class="L8413" rel="L8413">himself--as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. It is</li>
<li class="L8414" rel="L8414">the case of a shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to</li>
<li class="L8415" rel="L8415">be a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and</li>
<li class="L8416" rel="L8416">great exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his</li>
<li class="L8417" rel="L8417">stock of knowledge, which was already very large. But, unfortunately,</li>
<li class="L8418" rel="L8418">there has been,” he paused and took a deep breath--“a slight relapse.”</li>
<li class="L8419" rel="L8419"></li>
<li class="L8420" rel="L8420">The Doctor, in a low voice, asked, “Of how long duration?”</li>
<li class="L8421" rel="L8421"></li>
<li class="L8422" rel="L8422">“Nine days and nights.”</li>
<li class="L8423" rel="L8423"></li>
<li class="L8424" rel="L8424">“How did it show itself? I infer,” glancing at his hands again, “in the</li>
<li class="L8425" rel="L8425">resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?”</li>
<li class="L8426" rel="L8426"></li>
<li class="L8427" rel="L8427">“That is the fact.”</li>
<li class="L8428" rel="L8428"></li>
<li class="L8429" rel="L8429">“Now, did you ever see him,” asked the Doctor, distinctly and</li>
<li class="L8430" rel="L8430">collectedly, though in the same low voice, “engaged in that pursuit</li>
<li class="L8431" rel="L8431">originally?”</li>
<li class="L8432" rel="L8432"></li>
<li class="L8433" rel="L8433">“Once.”</li>
<li class="L8434" rel="L8434"></li>
<li class="L8435" rel="L8435">“And when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respects--or in all</li>
<li class="L8436" rel="L8436">respects--as he was then?”</li>
<li class="L8437" rel="L8437"></li>
<li class="L8438" rel="L8438">“I think in all respects.”</li>
<li class="L8439" rel="L8439"></li>
<li class="L8440" rel="L8440">“You spoke of his daughter. Does his daughter know of the relapse?”</li>
<li class="L8441" rel="L8441"></li>
<li class="L8442" rel="L8442">“No. It has been kept from her, and I hope will always be kept from her.</li>
<li class="L8443" rel="L8443">It is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted.”</li>
<li class="L8444" rel="L8444"></li>
<li class="L8445" rel="L8445">The Doctor grasped his hand, and murmured, “That was very kind. That was</li>
<li class="L8446" rel="L8446">very thoughtful!” Mr. Lorry grasped his hand in return, and neither of</li>
<li class="L8447" rel="L8447">the two spoke for a little while.</li>
<li class="L8448" rel="L8448"></li>
<li class="L8449" rel="L8449">“Now, my dear Manette,” said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his most</li>
<li class="L8450" rel="L8450">considerate and most affectionate way, “I am a mere man of business,</li>
<li class="L8451" rel="L8451">and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters. I do not</li>
<li class="L8452" rel="L8452">possess the kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of</li>
<li class="L8453" rel="L8453">intelligence; I want guiding. There is no man in this world on whom</li>
<li class="L8454" rel="L8454">I could so rely for right guidance, as on you. Tell me, how does this</li>
<li class="L8455" rel="L8455">relapse come about? Is there danger of another? Could a repetition of it</li>
<li class="L8456" rel="L8456">be prevented? How should a repetition of it be treated? How does it come</li>
<li class="L8457" rel="L8457">about at all? What can I do for my friend? No man ever can have been</li>
<li class="L8458" rel="L8458">more desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve mine,</li>
<li class="L8459" rel="L8459">if I knew how.</li>
<li class="L8460" rel="L8460"></li>
<li class="L8461" rel="L8461">“But I don&#39;t know how to originate, in such a case. If your sagacity,</li>
<li class="L8462" rel="L8462">knowledge, and experience, could put me on the right track, I might be</li>
<li class="L8463" rel="L8463">able to do so much; unenlightened and undirected, I can do so little.</li>
<li class="L8464" rel="L8464">Pray discuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly,</li>
<li class="L8465" rel="L8465">and teach me how to be a little more useful.”</li>
<li class="L8466" rel="L8466"></li>
<li class="L8467" rel="L8467">Doctor Manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken, and</li>
<li class="L8468" rel="L8468">Mr. Lorry did not press him.</li>
<li class="L8469" rel="L8469"></li>
<li class="L8470" rel="L8470">“I think it probable,” said the Doctor, breaking silence with an effort,</li>
<li class="L8471" rel="L8471">“that the relapse you have described, my dear friend, was not quite</li>
<li class="L8472" rel="L8472">unforeseen by its subject.”</li>
<li class="L8473" rel="L8473"></li>
<li class="L8474" rel="L8474">“Was it dreaded by him?” Mr. Lorry ventured to ask.</li>
<li class="L8475" rel="L8475"></li>
<li class="L8476" rel="L8476">“Very much.” He said it with an involuntary shudder.</li>
<li class="L8477" rel="L8477"></li>
<li class="L8478" rel="L8478">“You have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer&#39;s</li>
<li class="L8479" rel="L8479">mind, and how difficult--how almost impossible--it is, for him to force</li>
<li class="L8480" rel="L8480">himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him.”</li>
<li class="L8481" rel="L8481"></li>
<li class="L8482" rel="L8482">“Would he,” asked Mr. Lorry, “be sensibly relieved if he could prevail</li>
<li class="L8483" rel="L8483">upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one, when it is on</li>
<li class="L8484" rel="L8484">him?”</li>
<li class="L8485" rel="L8485"></li>
<li class="L8486" rel="L8486">“I think so. But it is, as I have told you, next to impossible. I even</li>
<li class="L8487" rel="L8487">believe it--in some cases--to be quite impossible.”</li>
<li class="L8488" rel="L8488"></li>
<li class="L8489" rel="L8489">“Now,” said Mr. Lorry, gently laying his hand on the Doctor&#39;s arm again,</li>
<li class="L8490" rel="L8490">after a short silence on both sides, “to what would you refer this</li>
<li class="L8491" rel="L8491">attack?”</li>
<li class="L8492" rel="L8492"></li>
<li class="L8493" rel="L8493">“I believe,” returned Doctor Manette, “that there had been a strong and</li>
<li class="L8494" rel="L8494">extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that</li>
<li class="L8495" rel="L8495">was the first cause of the malady. Some intense associations of a most</li>
<li class="L8496" rel="L8496">distressing nature were vividly recalled, I think. It is probable that</li>
<li class="L8497" rel="L8497">there had long been a dread lurking in his mind, that those associations</li>
<li class="L8498" rel="L8498">would be recalled--say, under certain circumstances--say, on a</li>
<li class="L8499" rel="L8499">particular occasion. He tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the</li>
<li class="L8500" rel="L8500">effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it.”</li>
<li class="L8501" rel="L8501"></li>
<li class="L8502" rel="L8502">“Would he remember what took place in the relapse?” asked Mr. Lorry,</li>
<li class="L8503" rel="L8503">with natural hesitation.</li>
<li class="L8504" rel="L8504"></li>
<li class="L8505" rel="L8505">The Doctor looked desolately round the room, shook his head, and</li>
<li class="L8506" rel="L8506">answered, in a low voice, “Not at all.”</li>
<li class="L8507" rel="L8507"></li>
<li class="L8508" rel="L8508">“Now, as to the future,” hinted Mr. Lorry.</li>
<li class="L8509" rel="L8509"></li>
<li class="L8510" rel="L8510">“As to the future,” said the Doctor, recovering firmness, “I should have</li>
<li class="L8511" rel="L8511">great hope. As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon, I</li>
<li class="L8512" rel="L8512">should have great hope. He, yielding under the pressure of a complicated</li>
<li class="L8513" rel="L8513">something, long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against,</li>
<li class="L8514" rel="L8514">and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed, I should hope that</li>
<li class="L8515" rel="L8515">the worst was over.”</li>
<li class="L8516" rel="L8516"></li>
<li class="L8517" rel="L8517">“Well, well! That&#39;s good comfort. I am thankful!” said Mr. Lorry.</li>
<li class="L8518" rel="L8518"></li>
<li class="L8519" rel="L8519">“I am thankful!” repeated the Doctor, bending his head with reverence.</li>
<li class="L8520" rel="L8520"></li>
<li class="L8521" rel="L8521">“There are two other points,” said Mr. Lorry, “on which I am anxious to</li>
<li class="L8522" rel="L8522">be instructed. I may go on?”</li>
<li class="L8523" rel="L8523"></li>
<li class="L8524" rel="L8524">“You cannot do your friend a better service.” The Doctor gave him his</li>
<li class="L8525" rel="L8525">hand.</li>
<li class="L8526" rel="L8526"></li>
<li class="L8527" rel="L8527">“To the first, then. He is of a studious habit, and unusually energetic;</li>
<li class="L8528" rel="L8528">he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional</li>
<li class="L8529" rel="L8529">knowledge, to the conducting of experiments, to many things. Now, does</li>
<li class="L8530" rel="L8530">he do too much?”</li>
<li class="L8531" rel="L8531"></li>
<li class="L8532" rel="L8532">“I think not. It may be the character of his mind, to be always in</li>
<li class="L8533" rel="L8533">singular need of occupation. That may be, in part, natural to it; in</li>
<li class="L8534" rel="L8534">part, the result of affliction. The less it was occupied with healthy</li>
<li class="L8535" rel="L8535">things, the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy</li>
<li class="L8536" rel="L8536">direction. He may have observed himself, and made the discovery.”</li>
<li class="L8537" rel="L8537"></li>
<li class="L8538" rel="L8538">“You are sure that he is not under too great a strain?”</li>
<li class="L8539" rel="L8539"></li>
<li class="L8540" rel="L8540">“I think I am quite sure of it.”</li>
<li class="L8541" rel="L8541"></li>
<li class="L8542" rel="L8542">“My dear Manette, if he were overworked now--”</li>
<li class="L8543" rel="L8543"></li>
<li class="L8544" rel="L8544">“My dear Lorry, I doubt if that could easily be. There has been a</li>
<li class="L8545" rel="L8545">violent stress in one direction, and it needs a counterweight.”</li>
<li class="L8546" rel="L8546"></li>
<li class="L8547" rel="L8547">“Excuse me, as a persistent man of business. Assuming for a moment,</li>
<li class="L8548" rel="L8548">that he _was_ overworked; it would show itself in some renewal of this</li>
<li class="L8549" rel="L8549">disorder?”</li>
<li class="L8550" rel="L8550"></li>
<li class="L8551" rel="L8551">“I do not think so. I do not think,” said Doctor Manette with the</li>
<li class="L8552" rel="L8552">firmness of self-conviction, “that anything but the one train of</li>
<li class="L8553" rel="L8553">association would renew it. I think that, henceforth, nothing but some</li>
<li class="L8554" rel="L8554">extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it. After what has</li>
<li class="L8555" rel="L8555">happened, and after his recovery, I find it difficult to imagine any</li>
<li class="L8556" rel="L8556">such violent sounding of that string again. I trust, and I almost</li>
<li class="L8557" rel="L8557">believe, that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted.”</li>
<li class="L8558" rel="L8558"></li>
<li class="L8559" rel="L8559">He spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing</li>
<li class="L8560" rel="L8560">would overset the delicate organisation of the mind, and yet with the</li>
<li class="L8561" rel="L8561">confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal</li>
<li class="L8562" rel="L8562">endurance and distress. It was not for his friend to abate that</li>
<li class="L8563" rel="L8563">confidence. He professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he</li>
<li class="L8564" rel="L8564">really was, and approached his second and last point. He felt it to</li>
<li class="L8565" rel="L8565">be the most difficult of all; but, remembering his old Sunday morning</li>
<li class="L8566" rel="L8566">conversation with Miss Pross, and remembering what he had seen in the</li>
<li class="L8567" rel="L8567">last nine days, he knew that he must face it.</li>
<li class="L8568" rel="L8568"></li>
<li class="L8569" rel="L8569">“The occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction</li>
<li class="L8570" rel="L8570">so happily recovered from,” said Mr. Lorry, clearing his throat, “we</li>
<li class="L8571" rel="L8571">will call--Blacksmith&#39;s work, Blacksmith&#39;s work. We will say, to put a</li>
<li class="L8572" rel="L8572">case and for the sake of illustration, that he had been used, in his bad</li>
<li class="L8573" rel="L8573">time, to work at a little forge. We will say that he was unexpectedly</li>
<li class="L8574" rel="L8574">found at his forge again. Is it not a pity that he should keep it by</li>
<li class="L8575" rel="L8575">him?”</li>
<li class="L8576" rel="L8576"></li>
<li class="L8577" rel="L8577">The Doctor shaded his forehead with his hand, and beat his foot</li>
<li class="L8578" rel="L8578">nervously on the ground.</li>
<li class="L8579" rel="L8579"></li>
<li class="L8580" rel="L8580">“He has always kept it by him,” said Mr. Lorry, with an anxious look at</li>
<li class="L8581" rel="L8581">his friend. “Now, would it not be better that he should let it go?”</li>
<li class="L8582" rel="L8582"></li>
<li class="L8583" rel="L8583">Still, the Doctor, with shaded forehead, beat his foot nervously on the</li>
<li class="L8584" rel="L8584">ground.</li>
<li class="L8585" rel="L8585"></li>
<li class="L8586" rel="L8586">“You do not find it easy to advise me?” said Mr. Lorry. “I quite</li>
<li class="L8587" rel="L8587">understand it to be a nice question. And yet I think--” And there he</li>
<li class="L8588" rel="L8588">shook his head, and stopped.</li>
<li class="L8589" rel="L8589"></li>
<li class="L8590" rel="L8590">“You see,” said Doctor Manette, turning to him after an uneasy pause,</li>
<li class="L8591" rel="L8591">“it is very hard to explain, consistently, the innermost workings</li>
<li class="L8592" rel="L8592">of this poor man&#39;s mind. He once yearned so frightfully for that</li>
<li class="L8593" rel="L8593">occupation, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved</li>
<li class="L8594" rel="L8594">his pain so much, by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for</li>
<li class="L8595" rel="L8595">the perplexity of the brain, and by substituting, as he became more</li>
<li class="L8596" rel="L8596">practised, the ingenuity of the hands, for the ingenuity of the mental</li>
<li class="L8597" rel="L8597">torture; that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it</li>
<li class="L8598" rel="L8598">quite out of his reach. Even now, when I believe he is more hopeful of</li>
<li class="L8599" rel="L8599">himself than he has ever been, and even speaks of himself with a kind</li>
<li class="L8600" rel="L8600">of confidence, the idea that he might need that old employment, and not</li>
<li class="L8601" rel="L8601">find it, gives him a sudden sense of terror, like that which one may</li>
<li class="L8602" rel="L8602">fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child.”</li>
<li class="L8603" rel="L8603"></li>
<li class="L8604" rel="L8604">He looked like his illustration, as he raised his eyes to Mr. Lorry&#39;s</li>
<li class="L8605" rel="L8605">face.</li>
<li class="L8606" rel="L8606"></li>
<li class="L8607" rel="L8607">“But may not--mind! I ask for information, as a plodding man of business</li>
<li class="L8608" rel="L8608">who only deals with such material objects as guineas, shillings, and</li>
<li class="L8609" rel="L8609">bank-notes--may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of</li>
<li class="L8610" rel="L8610">the idea? If the thing were gone, my dear Manette, might not the fear go</li>
<li class="L8611" rel="L8611">with it? In short, is it not a concession to the misgiving, to keep the</li>
<li class="L8612" rel="L8612">forge?”</li>
<li class="L8613" rel="L8613"></li>
<li class="L8614" rel="L8614">There was another silence.</li>
<li class="L8615" rel="L8615"></li>
<li class="L8616" rel="L8616">“You see, too,” said the Doctor, tremulously, “it is such an old</li>
<li class="L8617" rel="L8617">companion.”</li>
<li class="L8618" rel="L8618"></li>
<li class="L8619" rel="L8619">“I would not keep it,” said Mr. Lorry, shaking his head; for he gained</li>
<li class="L8620" rel="L8620">in firmness as he saw the Doctor disquieted. “I would recommend him to</li>
<li class="L8621" rel="L8621">sacrifice it. I only want your authority. I am sure it does no good.</li>
<li class="L8622" rel="L8622">Come! Give me your authority, like a dear good man. For his daughter&#39;s</li>
<li class="L8623" rel="L8623">sake, my dear Manette!”</li>
<li class="L8624" rel="L8624"></li>
<li class="L8625" rel="L8625">Very strange to see what a struggle there was within him!</li>
<li class="L8626" rel="L8626"></li>
<li class="L8627" rel="L8627">“In her name, then, let it be done; I sanction it. But, I would not take</li>
<li class="L8628" rel="L8628">it away while he was present. Let it be removed when he is not there;</li>
<li class="L8629" rel="L8629">let him miss his old companion after an absence.”</li>
<li class="L8630" rel="L8630"></li>
<li class="L8631" rel="L8631">Mr. Lorry readily engaged for that, and the conference was ended. They</li>
<li class="L8632" rel="L8632">passed the day in the country, and the Doctor was quite restored. On the</li>
<li class="L8633" rel="L8633">three following days he remained perfectly well, and on the fourteenth</li>
<li class="L8634" rel="L8634">day he went away to join Lucie and her husband. The precaution that</li>
<li class="L8635" rel="L8635">had been taken to account for his silence, Mr. Lorry had previously</li>
<li class="L8636" rel="L8636">explained to him, and he had written to Lucie in accordance with it, and</li>
<li class="L8637" rel="L8637">she had no suspicions.</li>
<li class="L8638" rel="L8638"></li>
<li class="L8639" rel="L8639">On the night of the day on which he left the house, Mr. Lorry went into</li>
<li class="L8640" rel="L8640">his room with a chopper, saw, chisel, and hammer, attended by Miss Pross</li>
<li class="L8641" rel="L8641">carrying a light. There, with closed doors, and in a mysterious and</li>
<li class="L8642" rel="L8642">guilty manner, Mr. Lorry hacked the shoemaker&#39;s bench to pieces, while</li>
<li class="L8643" rel="L8643">Miss Pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murder--for</li>
<li class="L8644" rel="L8644">which, indeed, in her grimness, she was no unsuitable figure. The</li>
<li class="L8645" rel="L8645">burning of the body (previously reduced to pieces convenient for the</li>
<li class="L8646" rel="L8646">purpose) was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire; and the tools,</li>
<li class="L8647" rel="L8647">shoes, and leather, were buried in the garden. So wicked do destruction</li>
<li class="L8648" rel="L8648">and secrecy appear to honest minds, that Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross,</li>
<li class="L8649" rel="L8649">while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its</li>
<li class="L8650" rel="L8650">traces, almost felt, and almost looked, like accomplices in a horrible</li>
<li class="L8651" rel="L8651">crime.</li>
<li class="L8652" rel="L8652"></li>
<li class="L8653" rel="L8653"></li>

<li class="L8656" rel="L8656">XX. A Plea</li>
<li class="L8657" rel="L8657"></li>
<li class="L8658" rel="L8658"></li>
<li class="L8659" rel="L8659">When the newly-married pair came home, the first person who appeared, to</li>
<li class="L8660" rel="L8660">offer his congratulations, was Sydney Carton. They had not been at home</li>
<li class="L8661" rel="L8661">many hours, when he presented himself. He was not improved in habits, or</li>
<li class="L8662" rel="L8662">in looks, or in manner; but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity</li>
<li class="L8663" rel="L8663">about him, which was new to the observation of Charles Darnay.</li>
<li class="L8664" rel="L8664"></li>
<li class="L8665" rel="L8665">He watched his opportunity of taking Darnay aside into a window, and of</li>
<li class="L8666" rel="L8666">speaking to him when no one overheard.</li>
<li class="L8667" rel="L8667"></li>
<li class="L8668" rel="L8668">“Mr. Darnay,” said Carton, “I wish we might be friends.”</li>
<li class="L8669" rel="L8669"></li>
<li class="L8670" rel="L8670">“We are already friends, I hope.”</li>
<li class="L8671" rel="L8671"></li>
<li class="L8672" rel="L8672">“You are good enough to say so, as a fashion of speech; but, I don&#39;t</li>
<li class="L8673" rel="L8673">mean any fashion of speech. Indeed, when I say I wish we might be</li>
<li class="L8674" rel="L8674">friends, I scarcely mean quite that, either.”</li>
<li class="L8675" rel="L8675"></li>
<li class="L8676" rel="L8676">Charles Darnay--as was natural--asked him, in all good-humour and</li>
<li class="L8677" rel="L8677">good-fellowship, what he did mean?</li>
<li class="L8678" rel="L8678"></li>
<li class="L8679" rel="L8679">“Upon my life,” said Carton, smiling, “I find that easier to comprehend</li>
<li class="L8680" rel="L8680">in my own mind, than to convey to yours. However, let me try. You</li>
<li class="L8681" rel="L8681">remember a certain famous occasion when I was more drunk than--than</li>
<li class="L8682" rel="L8682">usual?”</li>
<li class="L8683" rel="L8683"></li>
<li class="L8684" rel="L8684">“I remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that</li>
<li class="L8685" rel="L8685">you had been drinking.”</li>
<li class="L8686" rel="L8686"></li>
<li class="L8687" rel="L8687">“I remember it too. The curse of those occasions is heavy upon me, for I</li>
<li class="L8688" rel="L8688">always remember them. I hope it may be taken into account one day,</li>
<li class="L8689" rel="L8689">when all days are at an end for me! Don&#39;t be alarmed; I am not going to</li>
<li class="L8690" rel="L8690">preach.”</li>
<li class="L8691" rel="L8691"></li>
<li class="L8692" rel="L8692">“I am not at all alarmed. Earnestness in you, is anything but alarming</li>
<li class="L8693" rel="L8693">to me.”</li>
<li class="L8694" rel="L8694"></li>
<li class="L8695" rel="L8695">“Ah!” said Carton, with a careless wave of his hand, as if he waved that</li>
<li class="L8696" rel="L8696">away. “On the drunken occasion in question (one of a large number, as</li>
<li class="L8697" rel="L8697">you know), I was insufferable about liking you, and not liking you. I</li>
<li class="L8698" rel="L8698">wish you would forget it.”</li>
<li class="L8699" rel="L8699"></li>
<li class="L8700" rel="L8700">“I forgot it long ago.”</li>
<li class="L8701" rel="L8701"></li>
<li class="L8702" rel="L8702">“Fashion of speech again! But, Mr. Darnay, oblivion is not so easy to</li>
<li class="L8703" rel="L8703">me, as you represent it to be to you. I have by no means forgotten it,</li>
<li class="L8704" rel="L8704">and a light answer does not help me to forget it.”</li>
<li class="L8705" rel="L8705"></li>
<li class="L8706" rel="L8706">“If it was a light answer,” returned Darnay, “I beg your forgiveness</li>
<li class="L8707" rel="L8707">for it. I had no other object than to turn a slight thing, which, to my</li>
<li class="L8708" rel="L8708">surprise, seems to trouble you too much, aside. I declare to you, on the</li>
<li class="L8709" rel="L8709">faith of a gentleman, that I have long dismissed it from my mind. Good</li>
<li class="L8710" rel="L8710">Heaven, what was there to dismiss! Have I had nothing more important to</li>
<li class="L8711" rel="L8711">remember, in the great service you rendered me that day?”</li>
<li class="L8712" rel="L8712"></li>
<li class="L8713" rel="L8713">“As to the great service,” said Carton, “I am bound to avow to you, when</li>
<li class="L8714" rel="L8714">you speak of it in that way, that it was mere professional claptrap, I</li>
<li class="L8715" rel="L8715">don&#39;t know that I cared what became of you, when I rendered it.--Mind! I</li>
<li class="L8716" rel="L8716">say when I rendered it; I am speaking of the past.”</li>
<li class="L8717" rel="L8717"></li>
<li class="L8718" rel="L8718">“You make light of the obligation,” returned Darnay, “but I will not</li>
<li class="L8719" rel="L8719">quarrel with _your_ light answer.”</li>
<li class="L8720" rel="L8720"></li>
<li class="L8721" rel="L8721">“Genuine truth, Mr. Darnay, trust me! I have gone aside from my purpose;</li>
<li class="L8722" rel="L8722">I was speaking about our being friends. Now, you know me; you know I am</li>
<li class="L8723" rel="L8723">incapable of all the higher and better flights of men. If you doubt it,</li>
<li class="L8724" rel="L8724">ask Stryver, and he&#39;ll tell you so.”</li>
<li class="L8725" rel="L8725"></li>
<li class="L8726" rel="L8726">“I prefer to form my own opinion, without the aid of his.”</li>
<li class="L8727" rel="L8727"></li>
<li class="L8728" rel="L8728">“Well! At any rate you know me as a dissolute dog, who has never done</li>
<li class="L8729" rel="L8729">any good, and never will.”</li>
<li class="L8730" rel="L8730"></li>
<li class="L8731" rel="L8731">“I don&#39;t know that you &#39;never will.&#39;”</li>
<li class="L8732" rel="L8732"></li>
<li class="L8733" rel="L8733">“But I do, and you must take my word for it. Well! If you could endure</li>
<li class="L8734" rel="L8734">to have such a worthless fellow, and a fellow of such indifferent</li>
<li class="L8735" rel="L8735">reputation, coming and going at odd times, I should ask that I might be</li>
<li class="L8736" rel="L8736">permitted to come and go as a privileged person here; that I might</li>
<li class="L8737" rel="L8737">be regarded as an useless (and I would add, if it were not for the</li>
<li class="L8738" rel="L8738">resemblance I detected between you and me, an unornamental) piece of</li>
<li class="L8739" rel="L8739">furniture, tolerated for its old service, and taken no notice of. I</li>
<li class="L8740" rel="L8740">doubt if I should abuse the permission. It is a hundred to one if I</li>
<li class="L8741" rel="L8741">should avail myself of it four times in a year. It would satisfy me, I</li>
<li class="L8742" rel="L8742">dare say, to know that I had it.”</li>
<li class="L8743" rel="L8743"></li>
<li class="L8744" rel="L8744">“Will you try?”</li>
<li class="L8745" rel="L8745"></li>
<li class="L8746" rel="L8746">“That is another way of saying that I am placed on the footing I have</li>
<li class="L8747" rel="L8747">indicated. I thank you, Darnay. I may use that freedom with your name?”</li>
<li class="L8748" rel="L8748"></li>
<li class="L8749" rel="L8749">“I think so, Carton, by this time.”</li>
<li class="L8750" rel="L8750"></li>
<li class="L8751" rel="L8751">They shook hands upon it, and Sydney turned away. Within a minute</li>
<li class="L8752" rel="L8752">afterwards, he was, to all outward appearance, as unsubstantial as ever.</li>
<li class="L8753" rel="L8753"></li>
<li class="L8754" rel="L8754">When he was gone, and in the course of an evening passed with Miss</li>
<li class="L8755" rel="L8755">Pross, the Doctor, and Mr. Lorry, Charles Darnay made some mention of</li>
<li class="L8756" rel="L8756">this conversation in general terms, and spoke of Sydney Carton as a</li>
<li class="L8757" rel="L8757">problem of carelessness and recklessness. He spoke of him, in short, not</li>
<li class="L8758" rel="L8758">bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him, but as anybody might who saw</li>
<li class="L8759" rel="L8759">him as he showed himself.</li>
<li class="L8760" rel="L8760"></li>
<li class="L8761" rel="L8761">He had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young</li>
<li class="L8762" rel="L8762">wife; but, when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms, he found</li>
<li class="L8763" rel="L8763">her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly</li>
<li class="L8764" rel="L8764">marked.</li>
<li class="L8765" rel="L8765"></li>
<li class="L8766" rel="L8766">“We are thoughtful to-night!” said Darnay, drawing his arm about her.</li>
<li class="L8767" rel="L8767"></li>
<li class="L8768" rel="L8768">“Yes, dearest Charles,” with her hands on his breast, and the inquiring</li>
<li class="L8769" rel="L8769">and attentive expression fixed upon him; “we are rather thoughtful</li>
<li class="L8770" rel="L8770">to-night, for we have something on our mind to-night.”</li>
<li class="L8771" rel="L8771"></li>
<li class="L8772" rel="L8772">“What is it, my Lucie?”</li>
<li class="L8773" rel="L8773"></li>
<li class="L8774" rel="L8774">“Will you promise not to press one question on me, if I beg you not to</li>
<li class="L8775" rel="L8775">ask it?”</li>
<li class="L8776" rel="L8776"></li>
<li class="L8777" rel="L8777">“Will I promise? What will I not promise to my Love?”</li>
<li class="L8778" rel="L8778"></li>
<li class="L8779" rel="L8779">What, indeed, with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the</li>
<li class="L8780" rel="L8780">cheek, and his other hand against the heart that beat for him!</li>
<li class="L8781" rel="L8781"></li>
<li class="L8782" rel="L8782">“I think, Charles, poor Mr. Carton deserves more consideration and</li>
<li class="L8783" rel="L8783">respect than you expressed for him to-night.”</li>
<li class="L8784" rel="L8784"></li>
<li class="L8785" rel="L8785">“Indeed, my own? Why so?”</li>
<li class="L8786" rel="L8786"></li>
<li class="L8787" rel="L8787">“That is what you are not to ask me. But I think--I know--he does.”</li>
<li class="L8788" rel="L8788"></li>
<li class="L8789" rel="L8789">“If you know it, it is enough. What would you have me do, my Life?”</li>
<li class="L8790" rel="L8790"></li>
<li class="L8791" rel="L8791">“I would ask you, dearest, to be very generous with him always, and very</li>
<li class="L8792" rel="L8792">lenient on his faults when he is not by. I would ask you to believe that</li>
<li class="L8793" rel="L8793">he has a heart he very, very seldom reveals, and that there are deep</li>
<li class="L8794" rel="L8794">wounds in it. My dear, I have seen it bleeding.”</li>
<li class="L8795" rel="L8795"></li>
<li class="L8796" rel="L8796">“It is a painful reflection to me,” said Charles Darnay, quite</li>
<li class="L8797" rel="L8797">astounded, “that I should have done him any wrong. I never thought this</li>
<li class="L8798" rel="L8798">of him.”</li>
<li class="L8799" rel="L8799"></li>
<li class="L8800" rel="L8800">“My husband, it is so. I fear he is not to be reclaimed; there is</li>
<li class="L8801" rel="L8801">scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable</li>
<li class="L8802" rel="L8802">now. But, I am sure that he is capable of good things, gentle things,</li>
<li class="L8803" rel="L8803">even magnanimous things.”</li>
<li class="L8804" rel="L8804"></li>
<li class="L8805" rel="L8805">She looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man,</li>
<li class="L8806" rel="L8806">that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours.</li>
<li class="L8807" rel="L8807"></li>
<li class="L8808" rel="L8808">“And, O my dearest Love!” she urged, clinging nearer to him, laying her</li>
<li class="L8809" rel="L8809">head upon his breast, and raising her eyes to his, “remember how strong</li>
<li class="L8810" rel="L8810">we are in our happiness, and how weak he is in his misery!”</li>
<li class="L8811" rel="L8811"></li>
<li class="L8812" rel="L8812">The supplication touched him home. “I will always remember it, dear</li>
<li class="L8813" rel="L8813">Heart! I will remember it as long as I live.”</li>
<li class="L8814" rel="L8814"></li>
<li class="L8815" rel="L8815">He bent over the golden head, and put the rosy lips to his, and folded</li>
<li class="L8816" rel="L8816">her in his arms. If one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets,</li>
<li class="L8817" rel="L8817">could have heard her innocent disclosure, and could have seen the drops</li>
<li class="L8818" rel="L8818">of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of</li>
<li class="L8819" rel="L8819">that husband, he might have cried to the night--and the words would not</li>
<li class="L8820" rel="L8820">have parted from his lips for the first time--</li>
<li class="L8821" rel="L8821"></li>
<li class="L8822" rel="L8822">“God bless her for her sweet compassion!”</li>
<li class="L8823" rel="L8823"></li>
<li class="L8824" rel="L8824"></li>
<li class="L8825" rel="L8825"></li>
<li class="L8826" rel="L8826"></li>
<li class="L8827" rel="L8827">XXI. Echoing Footsteps</li>
<li class="L8828" rel="L8828"></li>
<li class="L8829" rel="L8829"></li>
<li class="L8830" rel="L8830">A wonderful corner for echoes, it has been remarked, that corner where</li>
<li class="L8831" rel="L8831">the Doctor lived. Ever busily winding the golden thread which bound</li>
<li class="L8832" rel="L8832">her husband, and her father, and herself, and her old directress and</li>
<li class="L8833" rel="L8833">companion, in a life of quiet bliss, Lucie sat in the still house in</li>
<li class="L8834" rel="L8834">the tranquilly resounding corner, listening to the echoing footsteps of</li>
<li class="L8835" rel="L8835">years.</li>
<li class="L8836" rel="L8836"></li>
<li class="L8837" rel="L8837">At first, there were times, though she was a perfectly happy young wife,</li>
<li class="L8838" rel="L8838">when her work would slowly fall from her hands, and her eyes would be</li>
<li class="L8839" rel="L8839">dimmed. For, there was something coming in the echoes, something light,</li>
<li class="L8840" rel="L8840">afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her heart too much.</li>
<li class="L8841" rel="L8841">Fluttering hopes and doubts--hopes, of a love as yet unknown to her:</li>
<li class="L8842" rel="L8842">doubts, of her remaining upon earth, to enjoy that new delight--divided</li>
<li class="L8843" rel="L8843">her breast. Among the echoes then, there would arise the sound of</li>
<li class="L8844" rel="L8844">footsteps at her own early grave; and thoughts of the husband who would</li>
<li class="L8845" rel="L8845">be left so desolate, and who would mourn for her so much, swelled to her</li>
<li class="L8846" rel="L8846">eyes, and broke like waves.</li>
<li class="L8847" rel="L8847"></li>
<li class="L8848" rel="L8848">That time passed, and her little Lucie lay on her bosom. Then, among the</li>
<li class="L8849" rel="L8849">advancing echoes, there was the tread of her tiny feet and the sound of</li>
<li class="L8850" rel="L8850">her prattling words. Let greater echoes resound as they would, the young</li>
<li class="L8851" rel="L8851">mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming. They came, and</li>
<li class="L8852" rel="L8852">the shady house was sunny with a child&#39;s laugh, and the Divine friend of</li>
<li class="L8853" rel="L8853">children, to whom in her trouble she had confided hers, seemed to take</li>
<li class="L8854" rel="L8854">her child in his arms, as He took the child of old, and made it a sacred</li>
<li class="L8855" rel="L8855">joy to her.</li>
<li class="L8856" rel="L8856"></li>
<li class="L8857" rel="L8857">Ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together,</li>
<li class="L8858" rel="L8858">weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all</li>
<li class="L8859" rel="L8859">their lives, and making it predominate nowhere, Lucie heard in the</li>
<li class="L8860" rel="L8860">echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds. Her husband&#39;s</li>
<li class="L8861" rel="L8861">step was strong and prosperous among them; her father&#39;s firm and equal.</li>
<li class="L8862" rel="L8862">Lo, Miss Pross, in harness of string, awakening the echoes, as an</li>
<li class="L8863" rel="L8863">unruly charger, whip-corrected, snorting and pawing the earth under the</li>
<li class="L8864" rel="L8864">plane-tree in the garden!</li>
<li class="L8865" rel="L8865"></li>
<li class="L8866" rel="L8866">Even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest, they were not</li>
<li class="L8867" rel="L8867">harsh nor cruel. Even when golden hair, like her own, lay in a halo on a</li>
<li class="L8868" rel="L8868">pillow round the worn face of a little boy, and he said, with a radiant</li>
<li class="L8869" rel="L8869">smile, “Dear papa and mamma, I am very sorry to leave you both, and to</li>
<li class="L8870" rel="L8870">leave my pretty sister; but I am called, and I must go!” those were not</li>
<li class="L8871" rel="L8871">tears all of agony that wetted his young mother&#39;s cheek, as the spirit</li>
<li class="L8872" rel="L8872">departed from her embrace that had been entrusted to it. Suffer them and</li>
<li class="L8873" rel="L8873">forbid them not. They see my Father&#39;s face. O Father, blessed words!</li>
<li class="L8874" rel="L8874"></li>
<li class="L8875" rel="L8875">Thus, the rustling of an Angel&#39;s wings got blended with the other</li>
<li class="L8876" rel="L8876">echoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but had in them that breath</li>
<li class="L8877" rel="L8877">of Heaven. Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were</li>
<li class="L8878" rel="L8878">mingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a hushed</li>
<li class="L8879" rel="L8879">murmur--like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore--as</li>
<li class="L8880" rel="L8880">the little Lucie, comically studious at the task of the morning, or</li>
<li class="L8881" rel="L8881">dressing a doll at her mother&#39;s footstool, chattered in the tongues of</li>
<li class="L8882" rel="L8882">the Two Cities that were blended in her life.</li>
<li class="L8883" rel="L8883"></li>
<li class="L8884" rel="L8884">The Echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton. Some</li>
<li class="L8885" rel="L8885">half-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of coming in</li>
<li class="L8886" rel="L8886">uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he had once</li>
<li class="L8887" rel="L8887">done often. He never came there heated with wine. And one other thing</li>
<li class="L8888" rel="L8888">regarding him was whispered in the echoes, which has been whispered by</li>
<li class="L8889" rel="L8889">all true echoes for ages and ages.</li>
<li class="L8890" rel="L8890"></li>
<li class="L8891" rel="L8891">No man ever really loved a woman, lost her, and knew her with a</li>
<li class="L8892" rel="L8892">blameless though an unchanged mind, when she was a wife and a mother,</li>
<li class="L8893" rel="L8893">but her children had a strange sympathy with him--an instinctive</li>
<li class="L8894" rel="L8894">delicacy of pity for him. What fine hidden sensibilities are touched in</li>
<li class="L8895" rel="L8895">such a case, no echoes tell; but it is so, and it was so here. Carton</li>
<li class="L8896" rel="L8896">was the first stranger to whom little Lucie held out her chubby arms,</li>
<li class="L8897" rel="L8897">and he kept his place with her as she grew. The little boy had spoken of</li>
<li class="L8898" rel="L8898">him, almost at the last. “Poor Carton! Kiss him for me!”</li>
<li class="L8899" rel="L8899"></li>
<li class="L8900" rel="L8900">Mr. Stryver shouldered his way through the law, like some great engine</li>
<li class="L8901" rel="L8901">forcing itself through turbid water, and dragged his useful friend in</li>
<li class="L8902" rel="L8902">his wake, like a boat towed astern. As the boat so favoured is usually</li>
<li class="L8903" rel="L8903">in a rough plight, and mostly under water, so, Sydney had a swamped</li>
<li class="L8904" rel="L8904">life of it. But, easy and strong custom, unhappily so much easier and</li>
<li class="L8905" rel="L8905">stronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace, made</li>
<li class="L8906" rel="L8906">it the life he was to lead; and he no more thought of emerging from his</li>
<li class="L8907" rel="L8907">state of lion&#39;s jackal, than any real jackal may be supposed to think of</li>
<li class="L8908" rel="L8908">rising to be a lion. Stryver was rich; had married a florid widow with</li>
<li class="L8909" rel="L8909">property and three boys, who had nothing particularly shining about them</li>
<li class="L8910" rel="L8910">but the straight hair of their dumpling heads.</li>
<li class="L8911" rel="L8911"></li>
<li class="L8912" rel="L8912">These three young gentlemen, Mr. Stryver, exuding patronage of the most</li>
<li class="L8913" rel="L8913">offensive quality from every pore, had walked before him like three</li>
<li class="L8914" rel="L8914">sheep to the quiet corner in Soho, and had offered as pupils to</li>
<li class="L8915" rel="L8915">Lucie&#39;s husband: delicately saying “Halloa! here are three lumps of</li>
<li class="L8916" rel="L8916">bread-and-cheese towards your matrimonial picnic, Darnay!” The polite</li>
<li class="L8917" rel="L8917">rejection of the three lumps of bread-and-cheese had quite bloated Mr.</li>
<li class="L8918" rel="L8918">Stryver with indignation, which he afterwards turned to account in the</li>
<li class="L8919" rel="L8919">training of the young gentlemen, by directing them to beware of the</li>
<li class="L8920" rel="L8920">pride of Beggars, like that tutor-fellow. He was also in the habit of</li>
<li class="L8921" rel="L8921">declaiming to Mrs. Stryver, over his full-bodied wine, on the arts</li>
<li class="L8922" rel="L8922">Mrs. Darnay had once put in practice to “catch” him, and on the</li>
<li class="L8923" rel="L8923">diamond-cut-diamond arts in himself, madam, which had rendered him “not</li>
<li class="L8924" rel="L8924">to be caught.” Some of his King&#39;s Bench familiars, who were occasionally</li>
<li class="L8925" rel="L8925">parties to the full-bodied wine and the lie, excused him for the</li>
<li class="L8926" rel="L8926">latter by saying that he had told it so often, that he believed</li>
<li class="L8927" rel="L8927">it himself--which is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an</li>
<li class="L8928" rel="L8928">originally bad offence, as to justify any such offender&#39;s being carried</li>
<li class="L8929" rel="L8929">off to some suitably retired spot, and there hanged out of the way.</li>
<li class="L8930" rel="L8930"></li>
<li class="L8931" rel="L8931">These were among the echoes to which Lucie, sometimes pensive, sometimes</li>
<li class="L8932" rel="L8932">amused and laughing, listened in the echoing corner, until her little</li>
<li class="L8933" rel="L8933">daughter was six years old. How near to her heart the echoes of her</li>
<li class="L8934" rel="L8934">child&#39;s tread came, and those of her own dear father&#39;s, always active</li>
<li class="L8935" rel="L8935">and self-possessed, and those of her dear husband&#39;s, need not be told.</li>
<li class="L8936" rel="L8936">Nor, how the lightest echo of their united home, directed by herself</li>
<li class="L8937" rel="L8937">with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any</li>
<li class="L8938" rel="L8938">waste, was music to her. Nor, how there were echoes all about her, sweet</li>
<li class="L8939" rel="L8939">in her ears, of the many times her father had told her that he found her</li>
<li class="L8940" rel="L8940">more devoted to him married (if that could be) than single, and of the</li>
<li class="L8941" rel="L8941">many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed</li>
<li class="L8942" rel="L8942">to divide her love for him or her help to him, and asked her “What is</li>
<li class="L8943" rel="L8943">the magic secret, my darling, of your being everything to all of us,</li>
<li class="L8944" rel="L8944">as if there were only one of us, yet never seeming to be hurried, or to</li>
<li class="L8945" rel="L8945">have too much to do?”</li>
<li class="L8946" rel="L8946"></li>
<li class="L8947" rel="L8947">But, there were other echoes, from a distance, that rumbled menacingly</li>
<li class="L8948" rel="L8948">in the corner all through this space of time. And it was now, about</li>
<li class="L8949" rel="L8949">little Lucie&#39;s sixth birthday, that they began to have an awful sound,</li>
<li class="L8950" rel="L8950">as of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising.</li>
<li class="L8951" rel="L8951"></li>
<li class="L8952" rel="L8952">On a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, Mr.</li>
<li class="L8953" rel="L8953">Lorry came in late, from Tellson&#39;s, and sat himself down by Lucie and</li>
<li class="L8954" rel="L8954">her husband in the dark window. It was a hot, wild night, and they were</li>
<li class="L8955" rel="L8955">all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the</li>
<li class="L8956" rel="L8956">lightning from the same place.</li>
<li class="L8957" rel="L8957"></li>
<li class="L8958" rel="L8958">“I began to think,” said Mr. Lorry, pushing his brown wig back, “that</li>
<li class="L8959" rel="L8959">I should have to pass the night at Tellson&#39;s. We have been so full of</li>
<li class="L8960" rel="L8960">business all day, that we have not known what to do first, or which way</li>
<li class="L8961" rel="L8961">to turn. There is such an uneasiness in Paris, that we have actually a</li>
<li class="L8962" rel="L8962">run of confidence upon us! Our customers over there, seem not to be able</li>
<li class="L8963" rel="L8963">to confide their property to us fast enough. There is positively a mania</li>
<li class="L8964" rel="L8964">among some of them for sending it to England.”</li>
<li class="L8965" rel="L8965"></li>
<li class="L8966" rel="L8966">“That has a bad look,” said Darnay--</li>
<li class="L8967" rel="L8967"></li>
<li class="L8968" rel="L8968">“A bad look, you say, my dear Darnay? Yes, but we don&#39;t know what reason</li>
<li class="L8969" rel="L8969">there is in it. People are so unreasonable! Some of us at Tellson&#39;s are</li>
<li class="L8970" rel="L8970">getting old, and we really can&#39;t be troubled out of the ordinary course</li>
<li class="L8971" rel="L8971">without due occasion.”</li>
<li class="L8972" rel="L8972"></li>
<li class="L8973" rel="L8973">“Still,” said Darnay, “you know how gloomy and threatening the sky is.”</li>
<li class="L8974" rel="L8974"></li>
<li class="L8975" rel="L8975">“I know that, to be sure,” assented Mr. Lorry, trying to persuade</li>
<li class="L8976" rel="L8976">himself that his sweet temper was soured, and that he grumbled, “but I</li>
<li class="L8977" rel="L8977">am determined to be peevish after my long day&#39;s botheration. Where is</li>
<li class="L8978" rel="L8978">Manette?”</li>
<li class="L8979" rel="L8979"></li>
<li class="L8980" rel="L8980">“Here he is,” said the Doctor, entering the dark room at the moment.</li>
<li class="L8981" rel="L8981"></li>
<li class="L8982" rel="L8982">“I am quite glad you are at home; for these hurries and forebodings by</li>
<li class="L8983" rel="L8983">which I have been surrounded all day long, have made me nervous without</li>
<li class="L8984" rel="L8984">reason. You are not going out, I hope?”</li>
<li class="L8985" rel="L8985"></li>
<li class="L8986" rel="L8986">“No; I am going to play backgammon with you, if you like,” said the</li>
<li class="L8987" rel="L8987">Doctor.</li>
<li class="L8988" rel="L8988"></li>
<li class="L8989" rel="L8989">“I don&#39;t think I do like, if I may speak my mind. I am not fit to be</li>
<li class="L8990" rel="L8990">pitted against you to-night. Is the teaboard still there, Lucie? I can&#39;t</li>
<li class="L8991" rel="L8991">see.”</li>
<li class="L8992" rel="L8992"></li>
<li class="L8993" rel="L8993">“Of course, it has been kept for you.”</li>
<li class="L8994" rel="L8994"></li>
<li class="L8995" rel="L8995">“Thank ye, my dear. The precious child is safe in bed?”</li>
<li class="L8996" rel="L8996"></li>
<li class="L8997" rel="L8997">“And sleeping soundly.”</li>
<li class="L8998" rel="L8998"></li>
<li class="L8999" rel="L8999">“That&#39;s right; all safe and well! I don&#39;t know why anything should be</li>
<li class="L9000" rel="L9000">otherwise than safe and well here, thank God; but I have been so put out</li>
<li class="L9001" rel="L9001">all day, and I am not as young as I was! My tea, my dear! Thank ye. Now,</li>
<li class="L9002" rel="L9002">come and take your place in the circle, and let us sit quiet, and hear</li>
<li class="L9003" rel="L9003">the echoes about which you have your theory.”</li>
<li class="L9004" rel="L9004"></li>
<li class="L9005" rel="L9005">“Not a theory; it was a fancy.”</li>
<li class="L9006" rel="L9006"></li>
<li class="L9007" rel="L9007">“A fancy, then, my wise pet,” said Mr. Lorry, patting her hand. “They</li>
<li class="L9008" rel="L9008">are very numerous and very loud, though, are they not? Only hear them!”</li>
<li class="L9009" rel="L9009"></li>
<li class="L9010" rel="L9010">Headlong, mad, and dangerous footsteps to force their way into anybody&#39;s</li>
<li class="L9011" rel="L9011">life, footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red, the</li>
<li class="L9012" rel="L9012">footsteps raging in Saint Antoine afar off, as the little circle sat in</li>
<li class="L9013" rel="L9013">the dark London window.</li>
<li class="L9014" rel="L9014"></li>
<li class="L9015" rel="L9015">Saint Antoine had been, that morning, a vast dusky mass of scarecrows</li>
<li class="L9016" rel="L9016">heaving to and fro, with frequent gleams of light above the billowy</li>
<li class="L9017" rel="L9017">heads, where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun. A tremendous</li>
<li class="L9018" rel="L9018">roar arose from the throat of Saint Antoine, and a forest of naked arms</li>
<li class="L9019" rel="L9019">struggled in the air like shrivelled branches of trees in a winter wind:</li>
<li class="L9020" rel="L9020">all the fingers convulsively clutching at every weapon or semblance of a</li>
<li class="L9021" rel="L9021">weapon that was thrown up from the depths below, no matter how far off.</li>
<li class="L9022" rel="L9022"></li>
<li class="L9023" rel="L9023">Who gave them out, whence they last came, where they began, through what</li>
<li class="L9024" rel="L9024">agency they crookedly quivered and jerked, scores at a time, over the</li>
<li class="L9025" rel="L9025">heads of the crowd, like a kind of lightning, no eye in the throng could</li>
<li class="L9026" rel="L9026">have told; but, muskets were being distributed--so were cartridges,</li>
<li class="L9027" rel="L9027">powder, and ball, bars of iron and wood, knives, axes, pikes, every</li>
<li class="L9028" rel="L9028">weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise. People who</li>
<li class="L9029" rel="L9029">could lay hold of nothing else, set themselves with bleeding hands to</li>
<li class="L9030" rel="L9030">force stones and bricks out of their places in walls. Every pulse and</li>
<li class="L9031" rel="L9031">heart in Saint Antoine was on high-fever strain and at high-fever heat.</li>
<li class="L9032" rel="L9032">Every living creature there held life as of no account, and was demented</li>
<li class="L9033" rel="L9033">with a passionate readiness to sacrifice it.</li>
<li class="L9034" rel="L9034"></li>
<li class="L9035" rel="L9035">As a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point, so, all this raging</li>
<li class="L9036" rel="L9036">circled round Defarge&#39;s wine-shop, and every human drop in the caldron</li>
<li class="L9037" rel="L9037">had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where Defarge himself,</li>
<li class="L9038" rel="L9038">already begrimed with gunpowder and sweat, issued orders, issued arms,</li>
<li class="L9039" rel="L9039">thrust this man back, dragged this man forward, disarmed one to arm</li>
<li class="L9040" rel="L9040">another, laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar.</li>
<li class="L9041" rel="L9041"></li>
<li class="L9042" rel="L9042">“Keep near to me, Jacques Three,” cried Defarge; “and do you, Jacques</li>
<li class="L9043" rel="L9043">One and Two, separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these</li>
<li class="L9044" rel="L9044">patriots as you can. Where is my wife?”</li>
<li class="L9045" rel="L9045"></li>
<li class="L9046" rel="L9046">“Eh, well! Here you see me!” said madame, composed as ever, but not</li>
<li class="L9047" rel="L9047">knitting to-day. Madame&#39;s resolute right hand was occupied with an axe,</li>
<li class="L9048" rel="L9048">in place of the usual softer implements, and in her girdle were a pistol</li>
<li class="L9049" rel="L9049">and a cruel knife.</li>
<li class="L9050" rel="L9050"></li>
<li class="L9051" rel="L9051">“Where do you go, my wife?”</li>
<li class="L9052" rel="L9052"></li>
<li class="L9053" rel="L9053">“I go,” said madame, “with you at present. You shall see me at the head</li>
<li class="L9054" rel="L9054">of women, by-and-bye.”</li>
<li class="L9055" rel="L9055"></li>
<li class="L9056" rel="L9056">“Come, then!” cried Defarge, in a resounding voice. “Patriots and</li>
<li class="L9057" rel="L9057">friends, we are ready! The Bastille!”</li>
<li class="L9058" rel="L9058"></li>
<li class="L9059" rel="L9059">With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been shaped</li>
<li class="L9060" rel="L9060">into the detested word, the living sea rose, wave on wave, depth on</li>
<li class="L9061" rel="L9061">depth, and overflowed the city to that point. Alarm-bells ringing, drums</li>
<li class="L9062" rel="L9062">beating, the sea raging and thundering on its new beach, the attack</li>
<li class="L9063" rel="L9063">began.</li>
<li class="L9064" rel="L9064"></li>
<li class="L9065" rel="L9065">Deep ditches, double drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great</li>
<li class="L9066" rel="L9066">towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. Through the fire and through</li>
<li class="L9067" rel="L9067">the smoke--in the fire and in the smoke, for the sea cast him up against</li>
<li class="L9068" rel="L9068">a cannon, and on the instant he became a cannonier--Defarge of the</li>
<li class="L9069" rel="L9069">wine-shop worked like a manful soldier, Two fierce hours.</li>
<li class="L9070" rel="L9070"></li>
<li class="L9071" rel="L9071">Deep ditch, single drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers,</li>
<li class="L9072" rel="L9072">cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. One drawbridge down! “Work, comrades</li>
<li class="L9073" rel="L9073">all, work! Work, Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques One Thousand, Jacques</li>
<li class="L9074" rel="L9074">Two Thousand, Jacques Five-and-Twenty Thousand; in the name of all</li>
<li class="L9075" rel="L9075">the Angels or the Devils--which you prefer--work!” Thus Defarge of the</li>
<li class="L9076" rel="L9076">wine-shop, still at his gun, which had long grown hot.</li>
<li class="L9077" rel="L9077"></li>
<li class="L9078" rel="L9078">“To me, women!” cried madame his wife. “What! We can kill as well as</li>
<li class="L9079" rel="L9079">the men when the place is taken!” And to her, with a shrill thirsty</li>
<li class="L9080" rel="L9080">cry, trooping women variously armed, but all armed alike in hunger and</li>
<li class="L9081" rel="L9081">revenge.</li>
<li class="L9082" rel="L9082"></li>
<li class="L9083" rel="L9083">Cannon, muskets, fire and smoke; but, still the deep ditch, the single</li>
<li class="L9084" rel="L9084">drawbridge, the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers. Slight</li>
<li class="L9085" rel="L9085">displacements of the raging sea, made by the falling wounded. Flashing</li>
<li class="L9086" rel="L9086">weapons, blazing torches, smoking waggonloads of wet straw, hard work</li>
<li class="L9087" rel="L9087">at neighbouring barricades in all directions, shrieks, volleys,</li>
<li class="L9088" rel="L9088">execrations, bravery without stint, boom smash and rattle, and the</li>
<li class="L9089" rel="L9089">furious sounding of the living sea; but, still the deep ditch, and the</li>
<li class="L9090" rel="L9090">single drawbridge, and the massive stone walls, and the eight great</li>
<li class="L9091" rel="L9091">towers, and still Defarge of the wine-shop at his gun, grown doubly hot</li>
<li class="L9092" rel="L9092">by the service of Four fierce hours.</li>
<li class="L9093" rel="L9093"></li>
<li class="L9094" rel="L9094">A white flag from within the fortress, and a parley--this dimly</li>
<li class="L9095" rel="L9095">perceptible through the raging storm, nothing audible in it--suddenly</li>
<li class="L9096" rel="L9096">the sea rose immeasurably wider and higher, and swept Defarge of the</li>
<li class="L9097" rel="L9097">wine-shop over the lowered drawbridge, past the massive stone outer</li>
<li class="L9098" rel="L9098">walls, in among the eight great towers surrendered!</li>
<li class="L9099" rel="L9099"></li>
<li class="L9100" rel="L9100">So resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on, that even to</li>
<li class="L9101" rel="L9101">draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had been</li>
<li class="L9102" rel="L9102">struggling in the surf at the South Sea, until he was landed in the</li>
<li class="L9103" rel="L9103">outer courtyard of the Bastille. There, against an angle of a wall, he</li>
<li class="L9104" rel="L9104">made a struggle to look about him. Jacques Three was nearly at his side;</li>
<li class="L9105" rel="L9105">Madame Defarge, still heading some of her women, was visible in the</li>
<li class="L9106" rel="L9106">inner distance, and her knife was in her hand. Everywhere was tumult,</li>
<li class="L9107" rel="L9107">exultation, deafening and maniacal bewilderment, astounding noise, yet</li>
<li class="L9108" rel="L9108">furious dumb-show.</li>
<li class="L9109" rel="L9109"></li>
<li class="L9110" rel="L9110">“The Prisoners!”</li>
<li class="L9111" rel="L9111"></li>
<li class="L9112" rel="L9112">“The Records!”</li>
<li class="L9113" rel="L9113"></li>
<li class="L9114" rel="L9114">“The secret cells!”</li>
<li class="L9115" rel="L9115"></li>
<li class="L9116" rel="L9116">“The instruments of torture!”</li>
<li class="L9117" rel="L9117"></li>
<li class="L9118" rel="L9118">“The Prisoners!”</li>
<li class="L9119" rel="L9119"></li>
<li class="L9120" rel="L9120">Of all these cries, and ten thousand incoherences, “The Prisoners!” was</li>
<li class="L9121" rel="L9121">the cry most taken up by the sea that rushed in, as if there were an</li>
<li class="L9122" rel="L9122">eternity of people, as well as of time and space. When the foremost</li>
<li class="L9123" rel="L9123">billows rolled past, bearing the prison officers with them, and</li>
<li class="L9124" rel="L9124">threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained</li>
<li class="L9125" rel="L9125">undisclosed, Defarge laid his strong hand on the breast of one of</li>
<li class="L9126" rel="L9126">these men--a man with a grey head, who had a lighted torch in his</li>
<li class="L9127" rel="L9127">hand--separated him from the rest, and got him between himself and the</li>
<li class="L9128" rel="L9128">wall.</li>
<li class="L9129" rel="L9129"></li>
<li class="L9130" rel="L9130">“Show me the North Tower!” said Defarge. “Quick!”</li>
<li class="L9131" rel="L9131"></li>
<li class="L9132" rel="L9132">“I will faithfully,” replied the man, “if you will come with me. But</li>
<li class="L9133" rel="L9133">there is no one there.”</li>
<li class="L9134" rel="L9134"></li>
<li class="L9135" rel="L9135">“What is the meaning of One Hundred and Five, North Tower?” asked</li>
<li class="L9136" rel="L9136">Defarge. “Quick!”</li>
<li class="L9137" rel="L9137"></li>
<li class="L9138" rel="L9138">“The meaning, monsieur?”</li>
<li class="L9139" rel="L9139"></li>
<li class="L9140" rel="L9140">“Does it mean a captive, or a place of captivity? Or do you mean that I</li>
<li class="L9141" rel="L9141">shall strike you dead?”</li>
<li class="L9142" rel="L9142"></li>
<li class="L9143" rel="L9143">“Kill him!” croaked Jacques Three, who had come close up.</li>
<li class="L9144" rel="L9144"></li>
<li class="L9145" rel="L9145">“Monsieur, it is a cell.”</li>
<li class="L9146" rel="L9146"></li>
<li class="L9147" rel="L9147">“Show it me!”</li>
<li class="L9148" rel="L9148"></li>
<li class="L9149" rel="L9149">“Pass this way, then.”</li>
<li class="L9150" rel="L9150"></li>
<li class="L9151" rel="L9151">Jacques Three, with his usual craving on him, and evidently disappointed</li>
<li class="L9152" rel="L9152">by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed,</li>
<li class="L9153" rel="L9153">held by Defarge&#39;s arm as he held by the turnkey&#39;s. Their three heads had</li>
<li class="L9154" rel="L9154">been close together during this brief discourse, and it had been as much</li>
<li class="L9155" rel="L9155">as they could do to hear one another, even then: so tremendous was the</li>
<li class="L9156" rel="L9156">noise of the living ocean, in its irruption into the Fortress, and</li>
<li class="L9157" rel="L9157">its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases. All around</li>
<li class="L9158" rel="L9158">outside, too, it beat the walls with a deep, hoarse roar, from which,</li>
<li class="L9159" rel="L9159">occasionally, some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the</li>
<li class="L9160" rel="L9160">air like spray.</li>
<li class="L9161" rel="L9161"></li>
<li class="L9162" rel="L9162">Through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone, past</li>
<li class="L9163" rel="L9163">hideous doors of dark dens and cages, down cavernous flights of steps,</li>
<li class="L9164" rel="L9164">and again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick, more like dry</li>
<li class="L9165" rel="L9165">waterfalls than staircases, Defarge, the turnkey, and Jacques Three,</li>
<li class="L9166" rel="L9166">linked hand and arm, went with all the speed they could make. Here and</li>
<li class="L9167" rel="L9167">there, especially at first, the inundation started on them and swept by;</li>
<li class="L9168" rel="L9168">but when they had done descending, and were winding and climbing up a</li>
<li class="L9169" rel="L9169">tower, they were alone. Hemmed in here by the massive thickness of walls</li>
<li class="L9170" rel="L9170">and arches, the storm within the fortress and without was only audible</li>
<li class="L9171" rel="L9171">to them in a dull, subdued way, as if the noise out of which they had</li>
<li class="L9172" rel="L9172">come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing.</li>
<li class="L9173" rel="L9173"></li>
<li class="L9174" rel="L9174">The turnkey stopped at a low door, put a key in a clashing lock, swung</li>
<li class="L9175" rel="L9175">the door slowly open, and said, as they all bent their heads and passed</li>
<li class="L9176" rel="L9176">in:</li>
<li class="L9177" rel="L9177"></li>
<li class="L9178" rel="L9178">“One hundred and five, North Tower!”</li>
<li class="L9179" rel="L9179"></li>
<li class="L9180" rel="L9180">There was a small, heavily-grated, unglazed window high in the wall,</li>
<li class="L9181" rel="L9181">with a stone screen before it, so that the sky could be only seen by</li>
<li class="L9182" rel="L9182">stooping low and looking up. There was a small chimney, heavily barred</li>
<li class="L9183" rel="L9183">across, a few feet within. There was a heap of old feathery wood-ashes</li>
<li class="L9184" rel="L9184">on the hearth. There was a stool, and table, and a straw bed. There were</li>
<li class="L9185" rel="L9185">the four blackened walls, and a rusted iron ring in one of them.</li>
<li class="L9186" rel="L9186"></li>
<li class="L9187" rel="L9187">“Pass that torch slowly along these walls, that I may see them,” said</li>
<li class="L9188" rel="L9188">Defarge to the turnkey.</li>
<li class="L9189" rel="L9189"></li>
<li class="L9190" rel="L9190">The man obeyed, and Defarge followed the light closely with his eyes.</li>
<li class="L9191" rel="L9191"></li>
<li class="L9192" rel="L9192">“Stop!--Look here, Jacques!”</li>
<li class="L9193" rel="L9193"></li>
<li class="L9194" rel="L9194">“A. M.!” croaked Jacques Three, as he read greedily.</li>
<li class="L9195" rel="L9195"></li>
<li class="L9196" rel="L9196">“Alexandre Manette,” said Defarge in his ear, following the letters</li>
<li class="L9197" rel="L9197">with his swart forefinger, deeply engrained with gunpowder. “And here he</li>
<li class="L9198" rel="L9198">wrote &#39;a poor physician.&#39; And it was he, without doubt, who scratched</li>
<li class="L9199" rel="L9199">a calendar on this stone. What is that in your hand? A crowbar? Give it</li>
<li class="L9200" rel="L9200">me!”</li>
<li class="L9201" rel="L9201"></li>
<li class="L9202" rel="L9202">He had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand. He made a sudden</li>
<li class="L9203" rel="L9203">exchange of the two instruments, and turning on the worm-eaten stool and</li>
<li class="L9204" rel="L9204">table, beat them to pieces in a few blows.</li>
<li class="L9205" rel="L9205"></li>
<li class="L9206" rel="L9206">“Hold the light higher!” he said, wrathfully, to the turnkey. “Look</li>
<li class="L9207" rel="L9207">among those fragments with care, Jacques. And see! Here is my knife,”</li>
<li class="L9208" rel="L9208"> throwing it to him; “rip open that bed, and search the straw. Hold the</li>
<li class="L9209" rel="L9209">light higher, you!”</li>
<li class="L9210" rel="L9210"></li>
<li class="L9211" rel="L9211">With a menacing look at the turnkey he crawled upon the hearth, and,</li>
<li class="L9212" rel="L9212">peering up the chimney, struck and prised at its sides with the crowbar,</li>
<li class="L9213" rel="L9213">and worked at the iron grating across it. In a few minutes, some mortar</li>
<li class="L9214" rel="L9214">and dust came dropping down, which he averted his face to avoid; and</li>
<li class="L9215" rel="L9215">in it, and in the old wood-ashes, and in a crevice in the chimney</li>
<li class="L9216" rel="L9216">into which his weapon had slipped or wrought itself, he groped with a</li>
<li class="L9217" rel="L9217">cautious touch.</li>
<li class="L9218" rel="L9218"></li>
<li class="L9219" rel="L9219">“Nothing in the wood, and nothing in the straw, Jacques?”</li>
<li class="L9220" rel="L9220"></li>
<li class="L9221" rel="L9221">“Nothing.”</li>
<li class="L9222" rel="L9222"></li>
<li class="L9223" rel="L9223">“Let us collect them together, in the middle of the cell. So! Light</li>
<li class="L9224" rel="L9224">them, you!”</li>
<li class="L9225" rel="L9225"></li>
<li class="L9226" rel="L9226">The turnkey fired the little pile, which blazed high and hot. Stooping</li>
<li class="L9227" rel="L9227">again to come out at the low-arched door, they left it burning, and</li>
<li class="L9228" rel="L9228">retraced their way to the courtyard; seeming to recover their sense</li>
<li class="L9229" rel="L9229">of hearing as they came down, until they were in the raging flood once</li>
<li class="L9230" rel="L9230">more.</li>
<li class="L9231" rel="L9231"></li>
<li class="L9232" rel="L9232">They found it surging and tossing, in quest of Defarge himself. Saint</li>
<li class="L9233" rel="L9233">Antoine was clamorous to have its wine-shop keeper foremost in the guard</li>
<li class="L9234" rel="L9234">upon the governor who had defended the Bastille and shot the people.</li>
<li class="L9235" rel="L9235">Otherwise, the governor would not be marched to the Hotel de Ville for</li>
<li class="L9236" rel="L9236">judgment. Otherwise, the governor would escape, and the people&#39;s</li>
<li class="L9237" rel="L9237">blood (suddenly of some value, after many years of worthlessness) be</li>
<li class="L9238" rel="L9238">unavenged.</li>
<li class="L9239" rel="L9239"></li>
<li class="L9240" rel="L9240">In the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to</li>
<li class="L9241" rel="L9241">encompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his grey coat and red</li>
<li class="L9242" rel="L9242">decoration, there was but one quite steady figure, and that was a</li>
<li class="L9243" rel="L9243">woman&#39;s. “See, there is my husband!” she cried, pointing him out.</li>
<li class="L9244" rel="L9244">“See Defarge!” She stood immovable close to the grim old officer, and</li>
<li class="L9245" rel="L9245">remained immovable close to him; remained immovable close to him through</li>
<li class="L9246" rel="L9246">the streets, as Defarge and the rest bore him along; remained immovable</li>
<li class="L9247" rel="L9247">close to him when he was got near his destination, and began to</li>
<li class="L9248" rel="L9248">be struck at from behind; remained immovable close to him when the</li>
<li class="L9249" rel="L9249">long-gathering rain of stabs and blows fell heavy; was so close to him</li>
<li class="L9250" rel="L9250">when he dropped dead under it, that, suddenly animated, she put her foot</li>
<li class="L9251" rel="L9251">upon his neck, and with her cruel knife--long ready--hewed off his head.</li>
<li class="L9252" rel="L9252"></li>
<li class="L9253" rel="L9253">The hour was come, when Saint Antoine was to execute his horrible idea</li>
<li class="L9254" rel="L9254">of hoisting up men for lamps to show what he could be and do. Saint</li>
<li class="L9255" rel="L9255">Antoine&#39;s blood was up, and the blood of tyranny and domination by the</li>
<li class="L9256" rel="L9256">iron hand was down--down on the steps of the Hotel de Ville where the</li>
<li class="L9257" rel="L9257">governor&#39;s body lay--down on the sole of the shoe of Madame Defarge</li>
<li class="L9258" rel="L9258">where she had trodden on the body to steady it for mutilation. “Lower</li>
<li class="L9259" rel="L9259">the lamp yonder!” cried Saint Antoine, after glaring round for a new</li>
<li class="L9260" rel="L9260">means of death; “here is one of his soldiers to be left on guard!” The</li>
<li class="L9261" rel="L9261">swinging sentinel was posted, and the sea rushed on.</li>
<li class="L9262" rel="L9262"></li>
<li class="L9263" rel="L9263">The sea of black and threatening waters, and of destructive upheaving</li>
<li class="L9264" rel="L9264">of wave against wave, whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces</li>
<li class="L9265" rel="L9265">were yet unknown. The remorseless sea of turbulently swaying shapes,</li>
<li class="L9266" rel="L9266">voices of vengeance, and faces hardened in the furnaces of suffering</li>
<li class="L9267" rel="L9267">until the touch of pity could make no mark on them.</li>
<li class="L9268" rel="L9268"></li>
<li class="L9269" rel="L9269">But, in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression was</li>
<li class="L9270" rel="L9270">in vivid life, there were two groups of faces--each seven in number--so</li>
<li class="L9271" rel="L9271">fixedly contrasting with the rest, that never did sea roll which bore</li>
<li class="L9272" rel="L9272">more memorable wrecks with it. Seven faces of prisoners, suddenly</li>
<li class="L9273" rel="L9273">released by the storm that had burst their tomb, were carried high</li>
<li class="L9274" rel="L9274">overhead: all scared, all lost, all wondering and amazed, as if the Last</li>
<li class="L9275" rel="L9275">Day were come, and those who rejoiced around them were lost spirits.</li>
<li class="L9276" rel="L9276">Other seven faces there were, carried higher, seven dead faces, whose</li>
<li class="L9277" rel="L9277">drooping eyelids and half-seen eyes awaited the Last Day. Impassive</li>
<li class="L9278" rel="L9278">faces, yet with a suspended--not an abolished--expression on them;</li>
<li class="L9279" rel="L9279">faces, rather, in a fearful pause, as having yet to raise the dropped</li>
<li class="L9280" rel="L9280">lids of the eyes, and bear witness with the bloodless lips, “THOU DIDST</li>
<li class="L9281" rel="L9281">IT!”</li>
<li class="L9282" rel="L9282"></li>
<li class="L9283" rel="L9283">Seven prisoners released, seven gory heads on pikes, the keys of the</li>
<li class="L9284" rel="L9284">accursed fortress of the eight strong towers, some discovered letters</li>
<li class="L9285" rel="L9285">and other memorials of prisoners of old time, long dead of broken</li>
<li class="L9286" rel="L9286">hearts,--such, and such--like, the loudly echoing footsteps of Saint</li>
<li class="L9287" rel="L9287">Antoine escort through the Paris streets in mid-July, one thousand seven</li>
<li class="L9288" rel="L9288">hundred and eighty-nine. Now, Heaven defeat the fancy of Lucie Darnay,</li>
<li class="L9289" rel="L9289">and keep these feet far out of her life! For, they are headlong, mad,</li>
<li class="L9290" rel="L9290">and dangerous; and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask</li>
<li class="L9291" rel="L9291">at Defarge&#39;s wine-shop door, they are not easily purified when once</li>
<li class="L9292" rel="L9292">stained red.</li>
<li class="L9293" rel="L9293"></li>
<li class="L9294" rel="L9294"></li>
<li class="L9295" rel="L9295"></li>
<li class="L9296" rel="L9296"></li>
<li class="L9297" rel="L9297">XXII. The Sea Still Rises</li>
<li class="L9298" rel="L9298"></li>
<li class="L9299" rel="L9299"></li>
<li class="L9300" rel="L9300">Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which to soften</li>
<li class="L9301" rel="L9301">his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could, with</li>
<li class="L9302" rel="L9302">the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when Madame</li>
<li class="L9303" rel="L9303">Defarge sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over the customers.</li>
<li class="L9304" rel="L9304">Madame Defarge wore no rose in her head, for the great brotherhood of</li>
<li class="L9305" rel="L9305">Spies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of trusting</li>
<li class="L9306" rel="L9306">themselves to the saint&#39;s mercies. The lamps across his streets had a</li>
<li class="L9307" rel="L9307">portentously elastic swing with them.</li>
<li class="L9308" rel="L9308"></li>
<li class="L9309" rel="L9309">Madame Defarge, with her arms folded, sat in the morning light and heat,</li>
<li class="L9310" rel="L9310">contemplating the wine-shop and the street. In both, there were several</li>
<li class="L9311" rel="L9311">knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with a manifest sense</li>
<li class="L9312" rel="L9312">of power enthroned on their distress. The raggedest nightcap, awry on</li>
<li class="L9313" rel="L9313">the wretchedest head, had this crooked significance in it: “I know how</li>
<li class="L9314" rel="L9314">hard it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to support life in myself;</li>
<li class="L9315" rel="L9315">but do you know how easy it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to</li>
<li class="L9316" rel="L9316">destroy life in you?” Every lean bare arm, that had been without work</li>
<li class="L9317" rel="L9317">before, had this work always ready for it now, that it could strike.</li>
<li class="L9318" rel="L9318">The fingers of the knitting women were vicious, with the experience that</li>
<li class="L9319" rel="L9319">they could tear. There was a change in the appearance of Saint Antoine;</li>
<li class="L9320" rel="L9320">the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years, and the</li>
<li class="L9321" rel="L9321">last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression.</li>
<li class="L9322" rel="L9322"></li>
<li class="L9323" rel="L9323">Madame Defarge sat observing it, with such suppressed approval as was</li>
<li class="L9324" rel="L9324">to be desired in the leader of the Saint Antoine women. One of her</li>
<li class="L9325" rel="L9325">sisterhood knitted beside her. The short, rather plump wife of a starved</li>
<li class="L9326" rel="L9326">grocer, and the mother of two children withal, this lieutenant had</li>
<li class="L9327" rel="L9327">already earned the complimentary name of The Vengeance.</li>
<li class="L9328" rel="L9328"></li>
<li class="L9329" rel="L9329">“Hark!” said The Vengeance. “Listen, then! Who comes?”</li>
<li class="L9330" rel="L9330"></li>
<li class="L9331" rel="L9331">As if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of Saint Antoine</li>
<li class="L9332" rel="L9332">Quarter to the wine-shop door, had been suddenly fired, a fast-spreading</li>
<li class="L9333" rel="L9333">murmur came rushing along.</li>
<li class="L9334" rel="L9334"></li>
<li class="L9335" rel="L9335">“It is Defarge,” said madame. “Silence, patriots!”</li>
<li class="L9336" rel="L9336"></li>
<li class="L9337" rel="L9337">Defarge came in breathless, pulled off a red cap he wore, and looked</li>
<li class="L9338" rel="L9338">around him! “Listen, everywhere!” said madame again. “Listen to him!”</li>
<li class="L9339" rel="L9339"> Defarge stood, panting, against a background of eager eyes and open</li>
<li class="L9340" rel="L9340">mouths, formed outside the door; all those within the wine-shop had</li>
<li class="L9341" rel="L9341">sprung to their feet.</li>
<li class="L9342" rel="L9342"></li>
<li class="L9343" rel="L9343">“Say then, my husband. What is it?”</li>
<li class="L9344" rel="L9344"></li>
<li class="L9345" rel="L9345">“News from the other world!”</li>
<li class="L9346" rel="L9346"></li>
<li class="L9347" rel="L9347">“How, then?” cried madame, contemptuously. “The other world?”</li>
<li class="L9348" rel="L9348"></li>
<li class="L9349" rel="L9349">“Does everybody here recall old Foulon, who told the famished people</li>
<li class="L9350" rel="L9350">that they might eat grass, and who died, and went to Hell?”</li>
<li class="L9351" rel="L9351"></li>
<li class="L9352" rel="L9352">“Everybody!” from all throats.</li>
<li class="L9353" rel="L9353"></li>
<li class="L9354" rel="L9354">“The news is of him. He is among us!”</li>
<li class="L9355" rel="L9355"></li>
<li class="L9356" rel="L9356">“Among us!” from the universal throat again. “And dead?”</li>
<li class="L9357" rel="L9357"></li>
<li class="L9358" rel="L9358">“Not dead! He feared us so much--and with reason--that he caused himself</li>
<li class="L9359" rel="L9359">to be represented as dead, and had a grand mock-funeral. But they have</li>
<li class="L9360" rel="L9360">found him alive, hiding in the country, and have brought him in. I have</li>
<li class="L9361" rel="L9361">seen him but now, on his way to the Hotel de Ville, a prisoner. I have</li>
<li class="L9362" rel="L9362">said that he had reason to fear us. Say all! _Had_ he reason?”</li>
<li class="L9363" rel="L9363"></li>
<li class="L9364" rel="L9364">Wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten, if he had</li>
<li class="L9365" rel="L9365">never known it yet, he would have known it in his heart of hearts if he</li>
<li class="L9366" rel="L9366">could have heard the answering cry.</li>
<li class="L9367" rel="L9367"></li>
<li class="L9368" rel="L9368">A moment of profound silence followed. Defarge and his wife looked</li>
<li class="L9369" rel="L9369">steadfastly at one another. The Vengeance stooped, and the jar of a drum</li>
<li class="L9370" rel="L9370">was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter.</li>
<li class="L9371" rel="L9371"></li>
<li class="L9372" rel="L9372">“Patriots!” said Defarge, in a determined voice, “are we ready?”</li>
<li class="L9373" rel="L9373"></li>
<li class="L9374" rel="L9374">Instantly Madame Defarge&#39;s knife was in her girdle; the drum was beating</li>
<li class="L9375" rel="L9375">in the streets, as if it and a drummer had flown together by magic; and</li>
<li class="L9376" rel="L9376">The Vengeance, uttering terrific shrieks, and flinging her arms about</li>
<li class="L9377" rel="L9377">her head like all the forty Furies at once, was tearing from house to</li>
<li class="L9378" rel="L9378">house, rousing the women.</li>
<li class="L9379" rel="L9379"></li>
<li class="L9380" rel="L9380">The men were terrible, in the bloody-minded anger with which they looked</li>
<li class="L9381" rel="L9381">from windows, caught up what arms they had, and came pouring down into</li>
<li class="L9382" rel="L9382">the streets; but, the women were a sight to chill the boldest. From</li>
<li class="L9383" rel="L9383">such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded, from their</li>
<li class="L9384" rel="L9384">children, from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground</li>
<li class="L9385" rel="L9385">famished and naked, they ran out with streaming hair, urging one</li>
<li class="L9386" rel="L9386">another, and themselves, to madness with the wildest cries and actions.</li>
<li class="L9387" rel="L9387">Villain Foulon taken, my sister! Old Foulon taken, my mother! Miscreant</li>
<li class="L9388" rel="L9388">Foulon taken, my daughter! Then, a score of others ran into the midst of</li>
<li class="L9389" rel="L9389">these, beating their breasts, tearing their hair, and screaming, Foulon</li>
<li class="L9390" rel="L9390">alive! Foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass! Foulon</li>
<li class="L9391" rel="L9391">who told my old father that he might eat grass, when I had no bread</li>
<li class="L9392" rel="L9392">to give him! Foulon who told my baby it might suck grass, when these</li>
<li class="L9393" rel="L9393">breasts were dry with want! O mother of God, this Foulon! O Heaven our</li>
<li class="L9394" rel="L9394">suffering! Hear me, my dead baby and my withered father: I swear on my</li>
<li class="L9395" rel="L9395">knees, on these stones, to avenge you on Foulon! Husbands, and brothers,</li>
<li class="L9396" rel="L9396">and young men, Give us the blood of Foulon, Give us the head of Foulon,</li>
<li class="L9397" rel="L9397">Give us the heart of Foulon, Give us the body and soul of Foulon, Rend</li>
<li class="L9398" rel="L9398">Foulon to pieces, and dig him into the ground, that grass may grow from</li>
<li class="L9399" rel="L9399">him! With these cries, numbers of the women, lashed into blind frenzy,</li>
<li class="L9400" rel="L9400">whirled about, striking and tearing at their own friends until they</li>
<li class="L9401" rel="L9401">dropped into a passionate swoon, and were only saved by the men</li>
<li class="L9402" rel="L9402">belonging to them from being trampled under foot.</li>
<li class="L9403" rel="L9403"></li>
<li class="L9404" rel="L9404">Nevertheless, not a moment was lost; not a moment! This Foulon was at</li>
<li class="L9405" rel="L9405">the Hotel de Ville, and might be loosed. Never, if Saint Antoine knew</li>
<li class="L9406" rel="L9406">his own sufferings, insults, and wrongs! Armed men and women flocked out</li>
<li class="L9407" rel="L9407">of the Quarter so fast, and drew even these last dregs after them with</li>
<li class="L9408" rel="L9408">such a force of suction, that within a quarter of an hour there was not</li>
<li class="L9409" rel="L9409">a human creature in Saint Antoine&#39;s bosom but a few old crones and the</li>
<li class="L9410" rel="L9410">wailing children.</li>
<li class="L9411" rel="L9411"></li>
<li class="L9412" rel="L9412">No. They were all by that time choking the Hall of Examination where</li>
<li class="L9413" rel="L9413">this old man, ugly and wicked, was, and overflowing into the adjacent</li>
<li class="L9414" rel="L9414">open space and streets. The Defarges, husband and wife, The Vengeance,</li>
<li class="L9415" rel="L9415">and Jacques Three, were in the first press, and at no great distance</li>
<li class="L9416" rel="L9416">from him in the Hall.</li>
<li class="L9417" rel="L9417"></li>
<li class="L9418" rel="L9418">“See!” cried madame, pointing with her knife. “See the old villain bound</li>
<li class="L9419" rel="L9419">with ropes. That was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his back.</li>
<li class="L9420" rel="L9420">Ha, ha! That was well done. Let him eat it now!” Madame put her knife</li>
<li class="L9421" rel="L9421">under her arm, and clapped her hands as at a play.</li>
<li class="L9422" rel="L9422"></li>
<li class="L9423" rel="L9423">The people immediately behind Madame Defarge, explaining the cause of</li>
<li class="L9424" rel="L9424">her satisfaction to those behind them, and those again explaining to</li>
<li class="L9425" rel="L9425">others, and those to others, the neighbouring streets resounded with the</li>
<li class="L9426" rel="L9426">clapping of hands. Similarly, during two or three hours of drawl,</li>
<li class="L9427" rel="L9427">and the winnowing of many bushels of words, Madame Defarge&#39;s frequent</li>
<li class="L9428" rel="L9428">expressions of impatience were taken up, with marvellous quickness, at</li>
<li class="L9429" rel="L9429">a distance: the more readily, because certain men who had by some</li>
<li class="L9430" rel="L9430">wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture</li>
<li class="L9431" rel="L9431">to look in from the windows, knew Madame Defarge well, and acted as a</li>
<li class="L9432" rel="L9432">telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building.</li>
<li class="L9433" rel="L9433"></li>
<li class="L9434" rel="L9434">At length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope or</li>
<li class="L9435" rel="L9435">protection, directly down upon the old prisoner&#39;s head. The favour was</li>
<li class="L9436" rel="L9436">too much to bear; in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had</li>
<li class="L9437" rel="L9437">stood surprisingly long, went to the winds, and Saint Antoine had got</li>
<li class="L9438" rel="L9438">him!</li>
<li class="L9439" rel="L9439"></li>
<li class="L9440" rel="L9440">It was known directly, to the furthest confines of the crowd. Defarge</li>
<li class="L9441" rel="L9441">had but sprung over a railing and a table, and folded the miserable</li>
<li class="L9442" rel="L9442">wretch in a deadly embrace--Madame Defarge had but followed and turned</li>
<li class="L9443" rel="L9443">her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied--The Vengeance and</li>
<li class="L9444" rel="L9444">Jacques Three were not yet up with them, and the men at the windows</li>
<li class="L9445" rel="L9445">had not yet swooped into the Hall, like birds of prey from their high</li>
<li class="L9446" rel="L9446">perches--when the cry seemed to go up, all over the city, “Bring him</li>
<li class="L9447" rel="L9447">out! Bring him to the lamp!”</li>
<li class="L9448" rel="L9448"></li>
<li class="L9449" rel="L9449">Down, and up, and head foremost on the steps of the building; now, on</li>
<li class="L9450" rel="L9450">his knees; now, on his feet; now, on his back; dragged, and struck at,</li>
<li class="L9451" rel="L9451">and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his</li>
<li class="L9452" rel="L9452">face by hundreds of hands; torn, bruised, panting, bleeding, yet always</li>
<li class="L9453" rel="L9453">entreating and beseeching for mercy; now full of vehement agony of</li>
<li class="L9454" rel="L9454">action, with a small clear space about him as the people drew one</li>
<li class="L9455" rel="L9455">another back that they might see; now, a log of dead wood drawn through</li>
<li class="L9456" rel="L9456">a forest of legs; he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one</li>
<li class="L9457" rel="L9457">of the fatal lamps swung, and there Madame Defarge let him go--as a cat</li>
<li class="L9458" rel="L9458">might have done to a mouse--and silently and composedly looked at him</li>
<li class="L9459" rel="L9459">while they made ready, and while he besought her: the women passionately</li>
<li class="L9460" rel="L9460">screeching at him all the time, and the men sternly calling out to have</li>
<li class="L9461" rel="L9461">him killed with grass in his mouth. Once, he went aloft, and the rope</li>
<li class="L9462" rel="L9462">broke, and they caught him shrieking; twice, he went aloft, and the rope</li>
<li class="L9463" rel="L9463">broke, and they caught him shrieking; then, the rope was merciful, and</li>
<li class="L9464" rel="L9464">held him, and his head was soon upon a pike, with grass enough in the</li>
<li class="L9465" rel="L9465">mouth for all Saint Antoine to dance at the sight of.</li>
<li class="L9466" rel="L9466"></li>
<li class="L9467" rel="L9467">Nor was this the end of the day&#39;s bad work, for Saint Antoine so shouted</li>
<li class="L9468" rel="L9468">and danced his angry blood up, that it boiled again, on hearing when</li>
<li class="L9469" rel="L9469">the day closed in that the son-in-law of the despatched, another of the</li>
<li class="L9470" rel="L9470">people&#39;s enemies and insulters, was coming into Paris under a guard</li>
<li class="L9471" rel="L9471">five hundred strong, in cavalry alone. Saint Antoine wrote his crimes</li>
<li class="L9472" rel="L9472">on flaring sheets of paper, seized him--would have torn him out of the</li>
<li class="L9473" rel="L9473">breast of an army to bear Foulon company--set his head and heart on</li>
<li class="L9474" rel="L9474">pikes, and carried the three spoils of the day, in Wolf-procession</li>
<li class="L9475" rel="L9475">through the streets.</li>
<li class="L9476" rel="L9476"></li>
<li class="L9477" rel="L9477">Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children,</li>
<li class="L9478" rel="L9478">wailing and breadless. Then, the miserable bakers&#39; shops were beset by</li>
<li class="L9479" rel="L9479">long files of them, patiently waiting to buy bad bread; and while</li>
<li class="L9480" rel="L9480">they waited with stomachs faint and empty, they beguiled the time by</li>
<li class="L9481" rel="L9481">embracing one another on the triumphs of the day, and achieving them</li>
<li class="L9482" rel="L9482">again in gossip. Gradually, these strings of ragged people shortened and</li>
<li class="L9483" rel="L9483">frayed away; and then poor lights began to shine in high windows, and</li>
<li class="L9484" rel="L9484">slender fires were made in the streets, at which neighbours cooked in</li>
<li class="L9485" rel="L9485">common, afterwards supping at their doors.</li>
<li class="L9486" rel="L9486"></li>
<li class="L9487" rel="L9487">Scanty and insufficient suppers those, and innocent of meat, as of</li>
<li class="L9488" rel="L9488">most other sauce to wretched bread. Yet, human fellowship infused</li>
<li class="L9489" rel="L9489">some nourishment into the flinty viands, and struck some sparks of</li>
<li class="L9490" rel="L9490">cheerfulness out of them. Fathers and mothers who had had their full</li>
<li class="L9491" rel="L9491">share in the worst of the day, played gently with their meagre children;</li>
<li class="L9492" rel="L9492">and lovers, with such a world around them and before them, loved and</li>
<li class="L9493" rel="L9493">hoped.</li>
<li class="L9494" rel="L9494"></li>
<li class="L9495" rel="L9495">It was almost morning, when Defarge&#39;s wine-shop parted with its last</li>
<li class="L9496" rel="L9496">knot of customers, and Monsieur Defarge said to madame his wife, in</li>
<li class="L9497" rel="L9497">husky tones, while fastening the door:</li>
<li class="L9498" rel="L9498"></li>
<li class="L9499" rel="L9499">“At last it is come, my dear!”</li>
<li class="L9500" rel="L9500"></li>
<li class="L9501" rel="L9501">“Eh well!” returned madame. “Almost.”</li>
<li class="L9502" rel="L9502"></li>
<li class="L9503" rel="L9503">Saint Antoine slept, the Defarges slept: even The Vengeance slept with</li>
<li class="L9504" rel="L9504">her starved grocer, and the drum was at rest. The drum&#39;s was the</li>
<li class="L9505" rel="L9505">only voice in Saint Antoine that blood and hurry had not changed. The</li>
<li class="L9506" rel="L9506">Vengeance, as custodian of the drum, could have wakened him up and had</li>
<li class="L9507" rel="L9507">the same speech out of him as before the Bastille fell, or old Foulon</li>
<li class="L9508" rel="L9508">was seized; not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in Saint</li>
<li class="L9509" rel="L9509">Antoine&#39;s bosom.</li>
<li class="L9510" rel="L9510"></li>
<li class="L9511" rel="L9511"></li>
<li class="L9512" rel="L9512"></li>
<li class="L9513" rel="L9513"></li>
<li class="L9514" rel="L9514">XXIII. Fire Rises</li>
<li class="L9515" rel="L9515"></li>
<li class="L9516" rel="L9516"></li>
<li class="L9517" rel="L9517">There was a change on the village where the fountain fell, and where</li>
<li class="L9518" rel="L9518">the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the</li>
<li class="L9519" rel="L9519">highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his</li>
<li class="L9520" rel="L9520">poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together. The prison on the</li>
<li class="L9521" rel="L9521">crag was not so dominant as of yore; there were soldiers to guard it,</li>
<li class="L9522" rel="L9522">but not many; there were officers to guard the soldiers, but not one of</li>
<li class="L9523" rel="L9523">them knew what his men would do--beyond this: that it would probably not</li>
<li class="L9524" rel="L9524">be what he was ordered.</li>
<li class="L9525" rel="L9525"></li>
<li class="L9526" rel="L9526">Far and wide lay a ruined country, yielding nothing but desolation.</li>
<li class="L9527" rel="L9527">Every green leaf, every blade of grass and blade of grain, was as</li>
<li class="L9528" rel="L9528">shrivelled and poor as the miserable people. Everything was bowed down,</li>
<li class="L9529" rel="L9529">dejected, oppressed, and broken. Habitations, fences, domesticated</li>
<li class="L9530" rel="L9530">animals, men, women, children, and the soil that bore them--all worn</li>
<li class="L9531" rel="L9531">out.</li>
<li class="L9532" rel="L9532"></li>
<li class="L9533" rel="L9533">Monseigneur (often a most worthy individual gentleman) was a national</li>
<li class="L9534" rel="L9534">blessing, gave a chivalrous tone to things, was a polite example of</li>
<li class="L9535" rel="L9535">luxurious and shining life, and a great deal more to equal purpose;</li>
<li class="L9536" rel="L9536">nevertheless, Monseigneur as a class had, somehow or other, brought</li>
<li class="L9537" rel="L9537">things to this. Strange that Creation, designed expressly for</li>
<li class="L9538" rel="L9538">Monseigneur, should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out! There must</li>
<li class="L9539" rel="L9539">be something short-sighted in the eternal arrangements, surely! Thus it</li>
<li class="L9540" rel="L9540">was, however; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the</li>
<li class="L9541" rel="L9541">flints, and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that</li>
<li class="L9542" rel="L9542">its purchase crumbled, and it now turned and turned with nothing</li>
<li class="L9543" rel="L9543">to bite, Monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and</li>
<li class="L9544" rel="L9544">unaccountable.</li>
<li class="L9545" rel="L9545"></li>
<li class="L9546" rel="L9546">But, this was not the change on the village, and on many a village like</li>
<li class="L9547" rel="L9547">it. For scores of years gone by, Monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung</li>
<li class="L9548" rel="L9548">it, and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures</li>
<li class="L9549" rel="L9549">of the chase--now, found in hunting the people; now, found in hunting</li>
<li class="L9550" rel="L9550">the beasts, for whose preservation Monseigneur made edifying spaces</li>
<li class="L9551" rel="L9551">of barbarous and barren wilderness. No. The change consisted in</li>
<li class="L9552" rel="L9552">the appearance of strange faces of low caste, rather than in the</li>
<li class="L9553" rel="L9553">disappearance of the high caste, chiselled, and otherwise beautified and</li>
<li class="L9554" rel="L9554">beautifying features of Monseigneur.</li>
<li class="L9555" rel="L9555"></li>
<li class="L9556" rel="L9556">For, in these times, as the mender of roads worked, solitary, in the</li>
<li class="L9557" rel="L9557">dust, not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and</li>
<li class="L9558" rel="L9558">to dust he must return, being for the most part too much occupied in</li>
<li class="L9559" rel="L9559">thinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if</li>
<li class="L9560" rel="L9560">he had it--in these times, as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour,</li>
<li class="L9561" rel="L9561">and viewed the prospect, he would see some rough figure approaching on</li>
<li class="L9562" rel="L9562">foot, the like of which was once a rarity in those parts, but was now</li>
<li class="L9563" rel="L9563">a frequent presence. As it advanced, the mender of roads would discern</li>
<li class="L9564" rel="L9564">without surprise, that it was a shaggy-haired man, of almost barbarian</li>
<li class="L9565" rel="L9565">aspect, tall, in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a</li>
<li class="L9566" rel="L9566">mender of roads, grim, rough, swart, steeped in the mud and dust of many</li>
<li class="L9567" rel="L9567">highways, dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds, sprinkled</li>
<li class="L9568" rel="L9568">with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods.</li>
<li class="L9569" rel="L9569"></li>
<li class="L9570" rel="L9570">Such a man came upon him, like a ghost, at noon in the July weather,</li>
<li class="L9571" rel="L9571">as he sat on his heap of stones under a bank, taking such shelter as he</li>
<li class="L9572" rel="L9572">could get from a shower of hail.</li>
<li class="L9573" rel="L9573"></li>
<li class="L9574" rel="L9574">The man looked at him, looked at the village in the hollow, at the mill,</li>
<li class="L9575" rel="L9575">and at the prison on the crag. When he had identified these objects</li>
<li class="L9576" rel="L9576">in what benighted mind he had, he said, in a dialect that was just</li>
<li class="L9577" rel="L9577">intelligible:</li>
<li class="L9578" rel="L9578"></li>
<li class="L9579" rel="L9579">“How goes it, Jacques?”</li>
<li class="L9580" rel="L9580"></li>
<li class="L9581" rel="L9581">“All well, Jacques.”</li>
<li class="L9582" rel="L9582"></li>
<li class="L9583" rel="L9583">“Touch then!”</li>
<li class="L9584" rel="L9584"></li>
<li class="L9585" rel="L9585">They joined hands, and the man sat down on the heap of stones.</li>
<li class="L9586" rel="L9586"></li>
<li class="L9587" rel="L9587">“No dinner?”</li>
<li class="L9588" rel="L9588"></li>
<li class="L9589" rel="L9589">“Nothing but supper now,” said the mender of roads, with a hungry face.</li>
<li class="L9590" rel="L9590"></li>
<li class="L9591" rel="L9591">“It is the fashion,” growled the man. “I meet no dinner anywhere.”</li>
<li class="L9592" rel="L9592"></li>
<li class="L9593" rel="L9593">He took out a blackened pipe, filled it, lighted it with flint and</li>
<li class="L9594" rel="L9594">steel, pulled at it until it was in a bright glow: then, suddenly held</li>
<li class="L9595" rel="L9595">it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and</li>
<li class="L9596" rel="L9596">thumb, that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke.</li>
<li class="L9597" rel="L9597"></li>
<li class="L9598" rel="L9598">“Touch then.” It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this</li>
<li class="L9599" rel="L9599">time, after observing these operations. They again joined hands.</li>
<li class="L9600" rel="L9600"></li>
<li class="L9601" rel="L9601">“To-night?” said the mender of roads.</li>
<li class="L9602" rel="L9602"></li>
<li class="L9603" rel="L9603">“To-night,” said the man, putting the pipe in his mouth.</li>
<li class="L9604" rel="L9604"></li>
<li class="L9605" rel="L9605">“Where?”</li>
<li class="L9606" rel="L9606"></li>
<li class="L9607" rel="L9607">“Here.”</li>
<li class="L9608" rel="L9608"></li>
<li class="L9609" rel="L9609">He and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at</li>
<li class="L9610" rel="L9610">one another, with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge</li>
<li class="L9611" rel="L9611">of bayonets, until the sky began to clear over the village.</li>
<li class="L9612" rel="L9612"></li>
<li class="L9613" rel="L9613">“Show me!” said the traveller then, moving to the brow of the hill.</li>
<li class="L9614" rel="L9614"></li>
<li class="L9615" rel="L9615">“See!” returned the mender of roads, with extended finger. “You go down</li>
<li class="L9616" rel="L9616">here, and straight through the street, and past the fountain--”</li>
<li class="L9617" rel="L9617"></li>
<li class="L9618" rel="L9618">“To the Devil with all that!” interrupted the other, rolling his eye</li>
<li class="L9619" rel="L9619">over the landscape. “_I_ go through no streets and past no fountains.</li>
<li class="L9620" rel="L9620">Well?”</li>
<li class="L9621" rel="L9621"></li>
<li class="L9622" rel="L9622">“Well! About two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the</li>
<li class="L9623" rel="L9623">village.”</li>
<li class="L9624" rel="L9624"></li>
<li class="L9625" rel="L9625">“Good. When do you cease to work?”</li>
<li class="L9626" rel="L9626"></li>
<li class="L9627" rel="L9627">“At sunset.”</li>
<li class="L9628" rel="L9628"></li>
<li class="L9629" rel="L9629">“Will you wake me, before departing? I have walked two nights without</li>
<li class="L9630" rel="L9630">resting. Let me finish my pipe, and I shall sleep like a child. Will you</li>
<li class="L9631" rel="L9631">wake me?”</li>
<li class="L9632" rel="L9632"></li>
<li class="L9633" rel="L9633">“Surely.”</li>
<li class="L9634" rel="L9634"></li>
<li class="L9635" rel="L9635">The wayfarer smoked his pipe out, put it in his breast, slipped off his</li>
<li class="L9636" rel="L9636">great wooden shoes, and lay down on his back on the heap of stones. He</li>
<li class="L9637" rel="L9637">was fast asleep directly.</li>
<li class="L9638" rel="L9638"></li>
<li class="L9639" rel="L9639">As the road-mender plied his dusty labour, and the hail-clouds, rolling</li>
<li class="L9640" rel="L9640">away, revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to</li>
<li class="L9641" rel="L9641">by silver gleams upon the landscape, the little man (who wore a red cap</li>
<li class="L9642" rel="L9642">now, in place of his blue one) seemed fascinated by the figure on the</li>
<li class="L9643" rel="L9643">heap of stones. His eyes were so often turned towards it, that he used</li>
<li class="L9644" rel="L9644">his tools mechanically, and, one would have said, to very poor account.</li>
<li class="L9645" rel="L9645">The bronze face, the shaggy black hair and beard, the coarse woollen</li>
<li class="L9646" rel="L9646">red cap, the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff and hairy skins of</li>
<li class="L9647" rel="L9647">beasts, the powerful frame attenuated by spare living, and the sullen</li>
<li class="L9648" rel="L9648">and desperate compression of the lips in sleep, inspired the mender</li>
<li class="L9649" rel="L9649">of roads with awe. The traveller had travelled far, and his feet were</li>
<li class="L9650" rel="L9650">footsore, and his ankles chafed and bleeding; his great shoes, stuffed</li>
<li class="L9651" rel="L9651">with leaves and grass, had been heavy to drag over the many long</li>
<li class="L9652" rel="L9652">leagues, and his clothes were chafed into holes, as he himself was into</li>
<li class="L9653" rel="L9653">sores. Stooping down beside him, the road-mender tried to get a peep at</li>
<li class="L9654" rel="L9654">secret weapons in his breast or where not; but, in vain, for he slept</li>
<li class="L9655" rel="L9655">with his arms crossed upon him, and set as resolutely as his lips.</li>
<li class="L9656" rel="L9656">Fortified towns with their stockades, guard-houses, gates, trenches, and</li>
<li class="L9657" rel="L9657">drawbridges, seemed to the mender of roads, to be so much air as against</li>
<li class="L9658" rel="L9658">this figure. And when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and</li>
<li class="L9659" rel="L9659">looked around, he saw in his small fancy similar figures, stopped by no</li>
<li class="L9660" rel="L9660">obstacle, tending to centres all over France.</li>
<li class="L9661" rel="L9661"></li>
<li class="L9662" rel="L9662">The man slept on, indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of</li>
<li class="L9663" rel="L9663">brightness, to sunshine on his face and shadow, to the paltering lumps</li>
<li class="L9664" rel="L9664">of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed</li>
<li class="L9665" rel="L9665">them, until the sun was low in the west, and the sky was glowing. Then,</li>
<li class="L9666" rel="L9666">the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready</li>
<li class="L9667" rel="L9667">to go down into the village, roused him.</li>
<li class="L9668" rel="L9668"></li>
<li class="L9669" rel="L9669">“Good!” said the sleeper, rising on his elbow. “Two leagues beyond the</li>
<li class="L9670" rel="L9670">summit of the hill?”</li>
<li class="L9671" rel="L9671"></li>
<li class="L9672" rel="L9672">“About.”</li>
<li class="L9673" rel="L9673"></li>
<li class="L9674" rel="L9674">“About. Good!”</li>
<li class="L9675" rel="L9675"></li>
<li class="L9676" rel="L9676">The mender of roads went home, with the dust going on before him</li>
<li class="L9677" rel="L9677">according to the set of the wind, and was soon at the fountain,</li>
<li class="L9678" rel="L9678">squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink, and</li>
<li class="L9679" rel="L9679">appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village.</li>
<li class="L9680" rel="L9680">When the village had taken its poor supper, it did not creep to bed,</li>
<li class="L9681" rel="L9681">as it usually did, but came out of doors again, and remained there. A</li>
<li class="L9682" rel="L9682">curious contagion of whispering was upon it, and also, when it gathered</li>
<li class="L9683" rel="L9683">together at the fountain in the dark, another curious contagion of</li>
<li class="L9684" rel="L9684">looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only. Monsieur Gabelle,</li>
<li class="L9685" rel="L9685">chief functionary of the place, became uneasy; went out on his house-top</li>
<li class="L9686" rel="L9686">alone, and looked in that direction too; glanced down from behind his</li>
<li class="L9687" rel="L9687">chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below, and sent word to</li>
<li class="L9688" rel="L9688">the sacristan who kept the keys of the church, that there might be need</li>
<li class="L9689" rel="L9689">to ring the tocsin by-and-bye.</li>
<li class="L9690" rel="L9690"></li>
<li class="L9691" rel="L9691">The night deepened. The trees environing the old chateau, keeping its</li>
<li class="L9692" rel="L9692">solitary state apart, moved in a rising wind, as though they threatened</li>
<li class="L9693" rel="L9693">the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom. Up the two terrace</li>
<li class="L9694" rel="L9694">flights of steps the rain ran wildly, and beat at the great door, like a</li>
<li class="L9695" rel="L9695">swift messenger rousing those within; uneasy rushes of wind went through</li>
<li class="L9696" rel="L9696">the hall, among the old spears and knives, and passed lamenting up the</li>
<li class="L9697" rel="L9697">stairs, and shook the curtains of the bed where the last Marquis</li>
<li class="L9698" rel="L9698">had slept. East, West, North, and South, through the woods, four</li>
<li class="L9699" rel="L9699">heavy-treading, unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the</li>
<li class="L9700" rel="L9700">branches, striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard. Four</li>
<li class="L9701" rel="L9701">lights broke out there, and moved away in different directions, and all</li>
<li class="L9702" rel="L9702">was black again.</li>
<li class="L9703" rel="L9703"></li>
<li class="L9704" rel="L9704">But, not for long. Presently, the chateau began to make itself strangely</li>
<li class="L9705" rel="L9705">visible by some light of its own, as though it were growing luminous.</li>
<li class="L9706" rel="L9706">Then, a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front,</li>
<li class="L9707" rel="L9707">picking out transparent places, and showing where balustrades, arches,</li>
<li class="L9708" rel="L9708">and windows were. Then it soared higher, and grew broader and brighter.</li>
<li class="L9709" rel="L9709">Soon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst forth, and the</li>
<li class="L9710" rel="L9710">stone faces awakened, stared out of fire.</li>
<li class="L9711" rel="L9711"></li>
<li class="L9712" rel="L9712">A faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left</li>
<li class="L9713" rel="L9713">there, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away. There was</li>
<li class="L9714" rel="L9714">spurring and splashing through the darkness, and bridle was drawn in the</li>
<li class="L9715" rel="L9715">space by the village fountain, and the horse in a foam stood at Monsieur</li>
<li class="L9716" rel="L9716">Gabelle&#39;s door. “Help, Gabelle! Help, every one!” The tocsin rang</li>
<li class="L9717" rel="L9717">impatiently, but other help (if that were any) there was none. The</li>
<li class="L9718" rel="L9718">mender of roads, and two hundred and fifty particular friends, stood</li>
<li class="L9719" rel="L9719">with folded arms at the fountain, looking at the pillar of fire in the</li>
<li class="L9720" rel="L9720">sky. “It must be forty feet high,” said they, grimly; and never moved.</li>
<li class="L9721" rel="L9721"></li>
<li class="L9722" rel="L9722">The rider from the chateau, and the horse in a foam, clattered away</li>
<li class="L9723" rel="L9723">through the village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on</li>
<li class="L9724" rel="L9724">the crag. At the gate, a group of officers were looking at the fire;</li>
<li class="L9725" rel="L9725">removed from them, a group of soldiers. “Help, gentlemen--officers! The</li>
<li class="L9726" rel="L9726">chateau is on fire; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by</li>
<li class="L9727" rel="L9727">timely aid! Help, help!” The officers looked towards the soldiers who</li>
<li class="L9728" rel="L9728">looked at the fire; gave no orders; and answered, with shrugs and biting</li>
<li class="L9729" rel="L9729">of lips, “It must burn.”</li>
<li class="L9730" rel="L9730"></li>
<li class="L9731" rel="L9731">As the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street, the</li>
<li class="L9732" rel="L9732">village was illuminating. The mender of roads, and the two hundred and</li>
<li class="L9733" rel="L9733">fifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea of</li>
<li class="L9734" rel="L9734">lighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles in</li>
<li class="L9735" rel="L9735">every dull little pane of glass. The general scarcity of everything,</li>
<li class="L9736" rel="L9736">occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of</li>
<li class="L9737" rel="L9737">Monsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on</li>
<li class="L9738" rel="L9738">that functionary&#39;s part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to</li>
<li class="L9739" rel="L9739">authority, had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with,</li>
<li class="L9740" rel="L9740">and that post-horses would roast.</li>
<li class="L9741" rel="L9741"></li>
<li class="L9742" rel="L9742">The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn. In the roaring and</li>
<li class="L9743" rel="L9743">raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from the</li>
<li class="L9744" rel="L9744">infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away. With the rising</li>
<li class="L9745" rel="L9745">and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were in</li>
<li class="L9746" rel="L9746">torment. When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with the</li>
<li class="L9747" rel="L9747">two dints in the nose became obscured: anon struggled out of the smoke</li>
<li class="L9748" rel="L9748">again, as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis, burning at the stake</li>
<li class="L9749" rel="L9749">and contending with the fire.</li>
<li class="L9750" rel="L9750"></li>
<li class="L9751" rel="L9751">The chateau burned; the nearest trees, laid hold of by the fire,</li>
<li class="L9752" rel="L9752">scorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance, fired by the four fierce</li>
<li class="L9753" rel="L9753">figures, begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke. Molten</li>
<li class="L9754" rel="L9754">lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain; the water ran</li>
<li class="L9755" rel="L9755">dry; the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the</li>
<li class="L9756" rel="L9756">heat, and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame. Great rents and</li>
<li class="L9757" rel="L9757">splits branched out in the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied</li>
<li class="L9758" rel="L9758">birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures</li>
<li class="L9759" rel="L9759">trudged away, East, West, North, and South, along the night-enshrouded</li>
<li class="L9760" rel="L9760">roads, guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next</li>
<li class="L9761" rel="L9761">destination. The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and,</li>
<li class="L9762" rel="L9762">abolishing the lawful ringer, rang for joy.</li>
<li class="L9763" rel="L9763"></li>
<li class="L9764" rel="L9764">Not only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, fire, and</li>
<li class="L9765" rel="L9765">bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with</li>
<li class="L9766" rel="L9766">the collection of rent and taxes--though it was but a small instalment</li>
<li class="L9767" rel="L9767">of taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those latter</li>
<li class="L9768" rel="L9768">days--became impatient for an interview with him, and, surrounding his</li>
<li class="L9769" rel="L9769">house, summoned him to come forth for personal conference. Whereupon,</li>
<li class="L9770" rel="L9770">Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel</li>
<li class="L9771" rel="L9771">with himself. The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again</li>
<li class="L9772" rel="L9772">withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time</li>
<li class="L9773" rel="L9773">resolved, if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man</li>
<li class="L9774" rel="L9774">of retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the</li>
<li class="L9775" rel="L9775">parapet, and crush a man or two below.</li>
<li class="L9776" rel="L9776"></li>
<li class="L9777" rel="L9777">Probably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with the</li>
<li class="L9778" rel="L9778">distant chateau for fire and candle, and the beating at his door,</li>
<li class="L9779" rel="L9779">combined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an</li>
<li class="L9780" rel="L9780">ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate,</li>
<li class="L9781" rel="L9781">which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour.</li>
<li class="L9782" rel="L9782">A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of</li>
<li class="L9783" rel="L9783">the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur</li>
<li class="L9784" rel="L9784">Gabelle had resolved! But, the friendly dawn appearing at last, and the</li>
<li class="L9785" rel="L9785">rush-candles of the village guttering out, the people happily dispersed,</li>
<li class="L9786" rel="L9786">and Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that</li>
<li class="L9787" rel="L9787">while.</li>
<li class="L9788" rel="L9788"></li>
<li class="L9789" rel="L9789">Within a hundred miles, and in the light of other fires, there were</li>
<li class="L9790" rel="L9790">other functionaries less fortunate, that night and other nights, whom</li>
<li class="L9791" rel="L9791">the rising sun found hanging across once-peaceful streets, where they</li>
<li class="L9792" rel="L9792">had been born and bred; also, there were other villagers and townspeople</li>
<li class="L9793" rel="L9793">less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows, upon whom the</li>
<li class="L9794" rel="L9794">functionaries and soldiery turned with success, and whom they strung up</li>
<li class="L9795" rel="L9795">in their turn. But, the fierce figures were steadily wending East, West,</li>
<li class="L9796" rel="L9796">North, and South, be that as it would; and whosoever hung, fire burned.</li>
<li class="L9797" rel="L9797">The altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it,</li>
<li class="L9798" rel="L9798">no functionary, by any stretch of mathematics, was able to calculate</li>
<li class="L9799" rel="L9799">successfully.</li>
<li class="L9800" rel="L9800"></li>
<li class="L9801" rel="L9801"></li>
<li class="L9802" rel="L9802"></li>
<li class="L9803" rel="L9803"></li>
<li class="L9804" rel="L9804">XXIV. Drawn to the Loadstone Rock</li>
<li class="L9805" rel="L9805"></li>
<li class="L9806" rel="L9806"></li>
<li class="L9807" rel="L9807">In such risings of fire and risings of sea--the firm earth shaken by</li>
<li class="L9808" rel="L9808">the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb, but was always on the</li>
<li class="L9809" rel="L9809">flow, higher and higher, to the terror and wonder of the beholders on</li>
<li class="L9810" rel="L9810">the shore--three years of tempest were consumed. Three more birthdays</li>
<li class="L9811" rel="L9811">of little Lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful</li>
<li class="L9812" rel="L9812">tissue of the life of her home.</li>
<li class="L9813" rel="L9813"></li>
<li class="L9814" rel="L9814">Many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in</li>
<li class="L9815" rel="L9815">the corner, with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging</li>
<li class="L9816" rel="L9816">feet. For, the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of</li>
<li class="L9817" rel="L9817">a people, tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in</li>
<li class="L9818" rel="L9818">danger, changed into wild beasts, by terrible enchantment long persisted</li>
<li class="L9819" rel="L9819">in.</li>
<li class="L9820" rel="L9820"></li>
<li class="L9821" rel="L9821">Monseigneur, as a class, had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of</li>
<li class="L9822" rel="L9822">his not being appreciated: of his being so little wanted in France, as</li>
<li class="L9823" rel="L9823">to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it, and</li>
<li class="L9824" rel="L9824">this life together. Like the fabled rustic who raised the Devil with</li>
<li class="L9825" rel="L9825">infinite pains, and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could</li>
<li class="L9826" rel="L9826">ask the Enemy no question, but immediately fled; so, Monseigneur, after</li>
<li class="L9827" rel="L9827">boldly reading the Lord&#39;s Prayer backwards for a great number of years,</li>
<li class="L9828" rel="L9828">and performing many other potent spells for compelling the Evil One, no</li>
<li class="L9829" rel="L9829">sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels.</li>
<li class="L9830" rel="L9830"></li>
<li class="L9831" rel="L9831">The shining Bull&#39;s Eye of the Court was gone, or it would have been the</li>
<li class="L9832" rel="L9832">mark for a hurricane of national bullets. It had never been a good</li>
<li class="L9833" rel="L9833">eye to see with--had long had the mote in it of Lucifer&#39;s pride,</li>
<li class="L9834" rel="L9834">Sardanapalus&#39;s luxury, and a mole&#39;s blindness--but it had dropped</li>
<li class="L9835" rel="L9835">out and was gone. The Court, from that exclusive inner circle to its</li>
<li class="L9836" rel="L9836">outermost rotten ring of intrigue, corruption, and dissimulation, was</li>
<li class="L9837" rel="L9837">all gone together. Royalty was gone; had been besieged in its Palace and</li>
<li class="L9838" rel="L9838">“suspended,” when the last tidings came over.</li>
<li class="L9839" rel="L9839"></li>
<li class="L9840" rel="L9840">The August of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two was</li>
<li class="L9841" rel="L9841">come, and Monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide.</li>
<li class="L9842" rel="L9842"></li>
<li class="L9843" rel="L9843">As was natural, the head-quarters and great gathering-place of</li>
<li class="L9844" rel="L9844">Monseigneur, in London, was Tellson&#39;s Bank. Spirits are supposed to</li>
<li class="L9845" rel="L9845">haunt the places where their bodies most resorted, and Monseigneur</li>
<li class="L9846" rel="L9846">without a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be.</li>
<li class="L9847" rel="L9847">Moreover, it was the spot to which such French intelligence as was most</li>
<li class="L9848" rel="L9848">to be relied upon, came quickest. Again: Tellson&#39;s was a munificent</li>
<li class="L9849" rel="L9849">house, and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen</li>
<li class="L9850" rel="L9850">from their high estate. Again: those nobles who had seen the coming</li>
<li class="L9851" rel="L9851">storm in time, and anticipating plunder or confiscation, had made</li>
<li class="L9852" rel="L9852">provident remittances to Tellson&#39;s, were always to be heard of there</li>
<li class="L9853" rel="L9853">by their needy brethren. To which it must be added that every new-comer</li>
<li class="L9854" rel="L9854">from France reported himself and his tidings at Tellson&#39;s, almost as</li>
<li class="L9855" rel="L9855">a matter of course. For such variety of reasons, Tellson&#39;s was at that</li>
<li class="L9856" rel="L9856">time, as to French intelligence, a kind of High Exchange; and this</li>
<li class="L9857" rel="L9857">was so well known to the public, and the inquiries made there were in</li>
<li class="L9858" rel="L9858">consequence so numerous, that Tellson&#39;s sometimes wrote the latest news</li>
<li class="L9859" rel="L9859">out in a line or so and posted it in the Bank windows, for all who ran</li>
<li class="L9860" rel="L9860">through Temple Bar to read.</li>
<li class="L9861" rel="L9861"></li>
<li class="L9862" rel="L9862">On a steaming, misty afternoon, Mr. Lorry sat at his desk, and Charles</li>
<li class="L9863" rel="L9863">Darnay stood leaning on it, talking with him in a low voice. The</li>
<li class="L9864" rel="L9864">penitential den once set apart for interviews with the House, was now</li>
<li class="L9865" rel="L9865">the news-Exchange, and was filled to overflowing. It was within half an</li>
<li class="L9866" rel="L9866">hour or so of the time of closing.</li>
<li class="L9867" rel="L9867"></li>
<li class="L9868" rel="L9868">“But, although you are the youngest man that ever lived,” said Charles</li>
<li class="L9869" rel="L9869">Darnay, rather hesitating, “I must still suggest to you--”</li>
<li class="L9870" rel="L9870"></li>
<li class="L9871" rel="L9871">“I understand. That I am too old?” said Mr. Lorry.</li>
<li class="L9872" rel="L9872"></li>
<li class="L9873" rel="L9873">“Unsettled weather, a long journey, uncertain means of travelling, a</li>
<li class="L9874" rel="L9874">disorganised country, a city that may not be even safe for you.”</li>
<li class="L9875" rel="L9875"></li>
<li class="L9876" rel="L9876">“My dear Charles,” said Mr. Lorry, with cheerful confidence, “you touch</li>
<li class="L9877" rel="L9877">some of the reasons for my going: not for my staying away. It is safe</li>
<li class="L9878" rel="L9878">enough for me; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard</li>
<li class="L9879" rel="L9879">upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth</li>
<li class="L9880" rel="L9880">interfering with. As to its being a disorganised city, if it were not a</li>
<li class="L9881" rel="L9881">disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our</li>
<li class="L9882" rel="L9882">House here to our House there, who knows the city and the business, of</li>
<li class="L9883" rel="L9883">old, and is in Tellson&#39;s confidence. As to the uncertain travelling, the</li>
<li class="L9884" rel="L9884">long journey, and the winter weather, if I were not prepared to submit</li>
<li class="L9885" rel="L9885">myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of Tellson&#39;s, after all</li>
<li class="L9886" rel="L9886">these years, who ought to be?”</li>
<li class="L9887" rel="L9887"></li>
<li class="L9888" rel="L9888">“I wish I were going myself,” said Charles Darnay, somewhat restlessly,</li>
<li class="L9889" rel="L9889">and like one thinking aloud.</li>
<li class="L9890" rel="L9890"></li>
<li class="L9891" rel="L9891">“Indeed! You are a pretty fellow to object and advise!” exclaimed Mr.</li>
<li class="L9892" rel="L9892">Lorry. “You wish you were going yourself? And you a Frenchman born? You</li>
<li class="L9893" rel="L9893">are a wise counsellor.”</li>
<li class="L9894" rel="L9894"></li>
<li class="L9895" rel="L9895">“My dear Mr. Lorry, it is because I am a Frenchman born, that the</li>
<li class="L9896" rel="L9896">thought (which I did not mean to utter here, however) has passed through</li>
<li class="L9897" rel="L9897">my mind often. One cannot help thinking, having had some sympathy for</li>
<li class="L9898" rel="L9898">the miserable people, and having abandoned something to them,” he spoke</li>
<li class="L9899" rel="L9899">here in his former thoughtful manner, “that one might be listened to,</li>
<li class="L9900" rel="L9900">and might have the power to persuade to some restraint. Only last night,</li>
<li class="L9901" rel="L9901">after you had left us, when I was talking to Lucie--”</li>
<li class="L9902" rel="L9902"></li>
<li class="L9903" rel="L9903">“When you were talking to Lucie,” Mr. Lorry repeated. “Yes. I wonder you</li>
<li class="L9904" rel="L9904">are not ashamed to mention the name of Lucie! Wishing you were going to</li>
<li class="L9905" rel="L9905">France at this time of day!”</li>
<li class="L9906" rel="L9906"></li>
<li class="L9907" rel="L9907">“However, I am not going,” said Charles Darnay, with a smile. “It is</li>
<li class="L9908" rel="L9908">more to the purpose that you say you are.”</li>
<li class="L9909" rel="L9909"></li>
<li class="L9910" rel="L9910">“And I am, in plain reality. The truth is, my dear Charles,” Mr. Lorry</li>
<li class="L9911" rel="L9911">glanced at the distant House, and lowered his voice, “you can have no</li>
<li class="L9912" rel="L9912">conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted, and</li>
<li class="L9913" rel="L9913">of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved. The</li>
<li class="L9914" rel="L9914">Lord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers</li>
<li class="L9915" rel="L9915">of people, if some of our documents were seized or destroyed; and they</li>
<li class="L9916" rel="L9916">might be, at any time, you know, for who can say that Paris is not set</li>
<li class="L9917" rel="L9917">afire to-day, or sacked to-morrow! Now, a judicious selection from these</li>
<li class="L9918" rel="L9918">with the least possible delay, and the burying of them, or otherwise</li>
<li class="L9919" rel="L9919">getting of them out of harm&#39;s way, is within the power (without loss of</li>
<li class="L9920" rel="L9920">precious time) of scarcely any one but myself, if any one. And shall</li>
<li class="L9921" rel="L9921">I hang back, when Tellson&#39;s knows this and says this--Tellson&#39;s, whose</li>
<li class="L9922" rel="L9922">bread I have eaten these sixty years--because I am a little stiff about</li>
<li class="L9923" rel="L9923">the joints? Why, I am a boy, sir, to half a dozen old codgers here!”</li>
<li class="L9924" rel="L9924"></li>
<li class="L9925" rel="L9925">“How I admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit, Mr. Lorry.”</li>
<li class="L9926" rel="L9926"></li>
<li class="L9927" rel="L9927">“Tut! Nonsense, sir!--And, my dear Charles,” said Mr. Lorry, glancing at</li>
<li class="L9928" rel="L9928">the House again, “you are to remember, that getting things out of</li>
<li class="L9929" rel="L9929">Paris at this present time, no matter what things, is next to an</li>
<li class="L9930" rel="L9930">impossibility. Papers and precious matters were this very day brought</li>
<li class="L9931" rel="L9931">to us here (I speak in strict confidence; it is not business-like to</li>
<li class="L9932" rel="L9932">whisper it, even to you), by the strangest bearers you can imagine,</li>
<li class="L9933" rel="L9933">every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed</li>
<li class="L9934" rel="L9934">the Barriers. At another time, our parcels would come and go, as easily</li>
<li class="L9935" rel="L9935">as in business-like Old England; but now, everything is stopped.”</li>
<li class="L9936" rel="L9936"></li>
<li class="L9937" rel="L9937">“And do you really go to-night?”</li>
<li class="L9938" rel="L9938"></li>
<li class="L9939" rel="L9939">“I really go to-night, for the case has become too pressing to admit of</li>
<li class="L9940" rel="L9940">delay.”</li>
<li class="L9941" rel="L9941"></li>
<li class="L9942" rel="L9942">“And do you take no one with you?”</li>
<li class="L9943" rel="L9943"></li>
<li class="L9944" rel="L9944">“All sorts of people have been proposed to me, but I will have nothing</li>
<li class="L9945" rel="L9945">to say to any of them. I intend to take Jerry. Jerry has been my</li>
<li class="L9946" rel="L9946">bodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time past and I am used to him.</li>
<li class="L9947" rel="L9947">Nobody will suspect Jerry of being anything but an English bull-dog, or</li>
<li class="L9948" rel="L9948">of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his</li>
<li class="L9949" rel="L9949">master.”</li>
<li class="L9950" rel="L9950"></li>
<li class="L9951" rel="L9951">“I must say again that I heartily admire your gallantry and</li>
<li class="L9952" rel="L9952">youthfulness.”</li>
<li class="L9953" rel="L9953"></li>
<li class="L9954" rel="L9954">“I must say again, nonsense, nonsense! When I have executed this little</li>
<li class="L9955" rel="L9955">commission, I shall, perhaps, accept Tellson&#39;s proposal to retire and</li>
<li class="L9956" rel="L9956">live at my ease. Time enough, then, to think about growing old.”</li>
<li class="L9957" rel="L9957"></li>
<li class="L9958" rel="L9958">This dialogue had taken place at Mr. Lorry&#39;s usual desk, with</li>
<li class="L9959" rel="L9959">Monseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it, boastful of what he</li>
<li class="L9960" rel="L9960">would do to avenge himself on the rascal-people before long. It was too</li>
<li class="L9961" rel="L9961">much the way of Monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee, and it</li>
<li class="L9962" rel="L9962">was much too much the way of native British orthodoxy, to talk of this</li>
<li class="L9963" rel="L9963">terrible Revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under</li>
<li class="L9964" rel="L9964">the skies that had not been sown--as if nothing had ever been done, or</li>
<li class="L9965" rel="L9965">omitted to be done, that had led to it--as if observers of the wretched</li>
<li class="L9966" rel="L9966">millions in France, and of the misused and perverted resources that</li>
<li class="L9967" rel="L9967">should have made them prosperous, had not seen it inevitably coming,</li>
<li class="L9968" rel="L9968">years before, and had not in plain words recorded what they saw. Such</li>
<li class="L9969" rel="L9969">vapouring, combined with the extravagant plots of Monseigneur for the</li>
<li class="L9970" rel="L9970">restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself,</li>
<li class="L9971" rel="L9971">and worn out Heaven and earth as well as itself, was hard to be endured</li>
<li class="L9972" rel="L9972">without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth. And it was</li>
<li class="L9973" rel="L9973">such vapouring all about his ears, like a troublesome confusion of blood</li>
<li class="L9974" rel="L9974">in his own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had</li>
<li class="L9975" rel="L9975">already made Charles Darnay restless, and which still kept him so.</li>
<li class="L9976" rel="L9976"></li>
<li class="L9977" rel="L9977">Among the talkers, was Stryver, of the King&#39;s Bench Bar, far on his</li>
<li class="L9978" rel="L9978">way to state promotion, and, therefore, loud on the theme: broaching</li>
<li class="L9979" rel="L9979">to Monseigneur, his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating</li>
<li class="L9980" rel="L9980">them from the face of the earth, and doing without them: and for</li>
<li class="L9981" rel="L9981">accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition</li>
<li class="L9982" rel="L9982">of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race. Him, Darnay heard</li>
<li class="L9983" rel="L9983">with a particular feeling of objection; and Darnay stood divided between</li>
<li class="L9984" rel="L9984">going away that he might hear no more, and remaining to interpose his</li>
<li class="L9985" rel="L9985">word, when the thing that was to be, went on to shape itself out.</li>
<li class="L9986" rel="L9986"></li>
<li class="L9987" rel="L9987">The House approached Mr. Lorry, and laying a soiled and unopened letter</li>
<li class="L9988" rel="L9988">before him, asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to</li>
<li class="L9989" rel="L9989">whom it was addressed? The House laid the letter down so close to Darnay</li>
<li class="L9990" rel="L9990">that he saw the direction--the more quickly because it was his own right</li>
<li class="L9991" rel="L9991">name. The address, turned into English, ran:</li>
<li class="L9992" rel="L9992"></li>
<li class="L9993" rel="L9993">“Very pressing. To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St. Evremonde, of</li>
<li class="L9994" rel="L9994">France. Confided to the cares of Messrs. Tellson and Co., Bankers,</li>
<li class="L9995" rel="L9995">London, England.”</li>
<li class="L9996" rel="L9996"></li>
<li class="L9997" rel="L9997">On the marriage morning, Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and</li>
<li class="L9998" rel="L9998">express request to Charles Darnay, that the secret of this name should</li>
<li class="L9999" rel="L9999">be--unless he, the Doctor, dissolved the obligation--kept inviolate</li>
<li class="L10000" rel="L10000">between them. Nobody else knew it to be his name; his own wife had no</li>
<li class="L10001" rel="L10001">suspicion of the fact; Mr. Lorry could have none.</li>
<li class="L10002" rel="L10002"></li>
<li class="L10003" rel="L10003">“No,” said Mr. Lorry, in reply to the House; “I have referred it,</li>
<li class="L10004" rel="L10004">I think, to everybody now here, and no one can tell me where this</li>
<li class="L10005" rel="L10005">gentleman is to be found.”</li>
<li class="L10006" rel="L10006"></li>
<li class="L10007" rel="L10007">The hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the Bank, there</li>
<li class="L10008" rel="L10008">was a general set of the current of talkers past Mr. Lorry&#39;s desk. He</li>
<li class="L10009" rel="L10009">held the letter out inquiringly; and Monseigneur looked at it, in the</li>
<li class="L10010" rel="L10010">person of this plotting and indignant refugee; and Monseigneur looked at</li>
<li class="L10011" rel="L10011">it in the person of that plotting and indignant refugee; and This, That,</li>
<li class="L10012" rel="L10012">and The Other, all had something disparaging to say, in French or in</li>
<li class="L10013" rel="L10013">English, concerning the Marquis who was not to be found.</li>
<li class="L10014" rel="L10014"></li>
<li class="L10015" rel="L10015">“Nephew, I believe--but in any case degenerate successor--of the</li>
<li class="L10016" rel="L10016">polished Marquis who was murdered,” said one. “Happy to say, I never</li>
<li class="L10017" rel="L10017">knew him.”</li>
<li class="L10018" rel="L10018"></li>
<li class="L10019" rel="L10019">“A craven who abandoned his post,” said another--this Monseigneur had</li>
<li class="L10020" rel="L10020">been got out of Paris, legs uppermost and half suffocated, in a load of</li>
<li class="L10021" rel="L10021">hay--“some years ago.”</li>
<li class="L10022" rel="L10022"></li>
<li class="L10023" rel="L10023">“Infected with the new doctrines,” said a third, eyeing the direction</li>
<li class="L10024" rel="L10024">through his glass in passing; “set himself in opposition to the last</li>
<li class="L10025" rel="L10025">Marquis, abandoned the estates when he inherited them, and left them to</li>
<li class="L10026" rel="L10026">the ruffian herd. They will recompense him now, I hope, as he deserves.”</li>
<li class="L10027" rel="L10027"></li>
<li class="L10028" rel="L10028">“Hey?” cried the blatant Stryver. “Did he though? Is that the sort of</li>
<li class="L10029" rel="L10029">fellow? Let us look at his infamous name. D--n the fellow!”</li>
<li class="L10030" rel="L10030"></li>
<li class="L10031" rel="L10031">Darnay, unable to restrain himself any longer, touched Mr. Stryver on</li>
<li class="L10032" rel="L10032">the shoulder, and said:</li>
<li class="L10033" rel="L10033"></li>
<li class="L10034" rel="L10034">“I know the fellow.”</li>
<li class="L10035" rel="L10035"></li>
<li class="L10036" rel="L10036">“Do you, by Jupiter?” said Stryver. “I am sorry for it.”</li>
<li class="L10037" rel="L10037"></li>
<li class="L10038" rel="L10038">“Why?”</li>
<li class="L10039" rel="L10039"></li>
<li class="L10040" rel="L10040">“Why, Mr. Darnay? D&#39;ye hear what he did? Don&#39;t ask, why, in these</li>
<li class="L10041" rel="L10041">times.”</li>
<li class="L10042" rel="L10042"></li>
<li class="L10043" rel="L10043">“But I do ask why?”</li>
<li class="L10044" rel="L10044"></li>
<li class="L10045" rel="L10045">“Then I tell you again, Mr. Darnay, I am sorry for it. I am sorry to</li>
<li class="L10046" rel="L10046">hear you putting any such extraordinary questions. Here is a fellow,</li>
<li class="L10047" rel="L10047">who, infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that</li>
<li class="L10048" rel="L10048">ever was known, abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth</li>
<li class="L10049" rel="L10049">that ever did murder by wholesale, and you ask me why I am sorry that a</li>
<li class="L10050" rel="L10050">man who instructs youth knows him? Well, but I&#39;ll answer you. I am sorry</li>
<li class="L10051" rel="L10051">because I believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel. That&#39;s</li>
<li class="L10052" rel="L10052">why.”</li>
<li class="L10053" rel="L10053"></li>
<li class="L10054" rel="L10054">Mindful of the secret, Darnay with great difficulty checked himself, and</li>
<li class="L10055" rel="L10055">said: “You may not understand the gentleman.”</li>
<li class="L10056" rel="L10056"></li>
<li class="L10057" rel="L10057">“I understand how to put _you_ in a corner, Mr. Darnay,” said Bully</li>
<li class="L10058" rel="L10058">Stryver, “and I&#39;ll do it. If this fellow is a gentleman, I _don&#39;t_</li>
<li class="L10059" rel="L10059">understand him. You may tell him so, with my compliments. You may also</li>
<li class="L10060" rel="L10060">tell him, from me, that after abandoning his worldly goods and position</li>
<li class="L10061" rel="L10061">to this butcherly mob, I wonder he is not at the head of them. But, no,</li>
<li class="L10062" rel="L10062">gentlemen,” said Stryver, looking all round, and snapping his fingers,</li>
<li class="L10063" rel="L10063">“I know something of human nature, and I tell you that you&#39;ll never</li>
<li class="L10064" rel="L10064">find a fellow like this fellow, trusting himself to the mercies of such</li>
<li class="L10065" rel="L10065">precious _protégés_. No, gentlemen; he&#39;ll always show &#39;em a clean pair</li>
<li class="L10066" rel="L10066">of heels very early in the scuffle, and sneak away.”</li>
<li class="L10067" rel="L10067"></li>
<li class="L10068" rel="L10068">With those words, and a final snap of his fingers, Mr. Stryver</li>
<li class="L10069" rel="L10069">shouldered himself into Fleet-street, amidst the general approbation of</li>
<li class="L10070" rel="L10070">his hearers. Mr. Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the desk,</li>

<li class="L10078" rel="L10078">“Will you undertake to explain, that we suppose it to have been</li>

<li class="L10080" rel="L10080">that it has been here some time?”</li>
<li class="L10081" rel="L10081"></li>
<li class="L10082" rel="L10082">“I will do so. Do you start for Paris from here?”</li>

<li class="L10097" rel="L10097">“After having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the</li>
<li class="L10098" rel="L10098">village, I have been seized, with great violence and indignity, and</li>
<li class="L10099" rel="L10099">brought a long journey on foot to Paris. On the road I have suffered a</li>
<li class="L10100" rel="L10100">great deal. Nor is that all; my house has been destroyed--razed to the</li>

<li class="L10108" rel="L10108">against, according to your commands. It is in vain I represent that,</li>
<li class="L10109" rel="L10109">before the sequestration of emigrant property, I had remitted the</li>
<li class="L10110" rel="L10110">imposts they had ceased to pay; that I had collected no rent; that I had</li>
<li class="L10111" rel="L10111">had recourse to no process. The only response is, that I have acted for</li>

<li class="L10134" rel="L10134">The latent uneasiness in Darnay&#39;s mind was roused to vigourous life</li>
<li class="L10135" rel="L10135">by this letter. The peril of an old servant and a good one, whose</li>
<li class="L10136" rel="L10136">only crime was fidelity to himself and his family, stared him so</li>
<li class="L10137" rel="L10137">reproachfully in the face, that, as he walked to and fro in the Temple</li>
<li class="L10138" rel="L10138">considering what to do, he almost hid his face from the passersby.</li>
<li class="L10139" rel="L10139"></li>
<li class="L10140" rel="L10140">He knew very well, that in his horror of the deed which had culminated</li>
<li class="L10141" rel="L10141">the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house, in his</li>
<li class="L10142" rel="L10142">resentful suspicions of his uncle, and in the aversion with which his</li>
<li class="L10143" rel="L10143">conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold,</li>
<li class="L10144" rel="L10144">he had acted imperfectly. He knew very well, that in his love for Lucie,</li>
<li class="L10145" rel="L10145">his renunciation of his social place, though by no means new to his own</li>
<li class="L10146" rel="L10146">mind, had been hurried and incomplete. He knew that he ought to have</li>
<li class="L10147" rel="L10147">systematically worked it out and supervised it, and that he had meant to</li>
<li class="L10148" rel="L10148">do it, and that it had never been done.</li>
<li class="L10149" rel="L10149"></li>
<li class="L10150" rel="L10150">The happiness of his own chosen English home, the necessity of being</li>
<li class="L10151" rel="L10151">always actively employed, the swift changes and troubles of the time</li>
<li class="L10152" rel="L10152">which had followed on one another so fast, that the events of this week</li>
<li class="L10153" rel="L10153">annihilated the immature plans of last week, and the events of the week</li>
<li class="L10154" rel="L10154">following made all new again; he knew very well, that to the force of</li>
<li class="L10155" rel="L10155">these circumstances he had yielded:--not without disquiet, but still</li>
<li class="L10156" rel="L10156">without continuous and accumulating resistance. That he had watched</li>
<li class="L10157" rel="L10157">the times for a time of action, and that they had shifted and struggled</li>
<li class="L10158" rel="L10158">until the time had gone by, and the nobility were trooping from</li>
<li class="L10159" rel="L10159">France by every highway and byway, and their property was in course of</li>
<li class="L10160" rel="L10160">confiscation and destruction, and their very names were blotting out,</li>
<li class="L10161" rel="L10161">was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in</li>
<li class="L10162" rel="L10162">France that might impeach him for it.</li>
<li class="L10163" rel="L10163"></li>
<li class="L10164" rel="L10164">But, he had oppressed no man, he had imprisoned no man; he was so</li>
<li class="L10165" rel="L10165">far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues, that he had</li>
<li class="L10166" rel="L10166">relinquished them of his own will, thrown himself on a world with no</li>
<li class="L10167" rel="L10167">favour in it, won his own private place there, and earned his own</li>
<li class="L10168" rel="L10168">bread. Monsieur Gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate</li>
<li class="L10169" rel="L10169">on written instructions, to spare the people, to give them what little</li>
<li class="L10170" rel="L10170">there was to give--such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have</li>
<li class="L10171" rel="L10171">in the winter, and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in</li>
<li class="L10172" rel="L10172">the summer--and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof, for his</li>
<li class="L10173" rel="L10173">own safety, so that it could not but appear now.</li>
<li class="L10174" rel="L10174"></li>
<li class="L10175" rel="L10175">This favoured the desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to make,</li>
<li class="L10176" rel="L10176">that he would go to Paris.</li>
<li class="L10177" rel="L10177"></li>
<li class="L10178" rel="L10178">Yes. Like the mariner in the old story, the winds and streams had driven</li>
<li class="L10179" rel="L10179">him within the influence of the Loadstone Rock, and it was drawing him</li>
<li class="L10180" rel="L10180">to itself, and he must go. Everything that arose before his mind drifted</li>
<li class="L10181" rel="L10181">him on, faster and faster, more and more steadily, to the terrible</li>
<li class="L10182" rel="L10182">attraction. His latent uneasiness had been, that bad aims were being</li>
<li class="L10183" rel="L10183">worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments, and that he who</li>
<li class="L10184" rel="L10184">could not fail to know that he was better than they, was not there,</li>
<li class="L10185" rel="L10185">trying to do something to stay bloodshed, and assert the claims of mercy</li>
<li class="L10186" rel="L10186">and humanity. With this uneasiness half stifled, and half reproaching</li>
<li class="L10187" rel="L10187">him, he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the</li>
<li class="L10188" rel="L10188">brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong; upon that comparison</li>
<li class="L10189" rel="L10189">(injurious to himself) had instantly followed the sneers of Monseigneur,</li>
<li class="L10190" rel="L10190">which had stung him bitterly, and those of Stryver, which above all were</li>
<li class="L10191" rel="L10191">coarse and galling, for old reasons. Upon those, had followed Gabelle&#39;s</li>
<li class="L10192" rel="L10192">letter: the appeal of an innocent prisoner, in danger of death, to his</li>
<li class="L10193" rel="L10193">justice, honour, and good name.</li>
<li class="L10194" rel="L10194"></li>
<li class="L10195" rel="L10195">His resolution was made. He must go to Paris.</li>
<li class="L10196" rel="L10196"></li>
<li class="L10197" rel="L10197">Yes. The Loadstone Rock was drawing him, and he must sail on, until he</li>
<li class="L10198" rel="L10198">struck. He knew of no rock; he saw hardly any danger. The intention</li>
<li class="L10199" rel="L10199">with which he had done what he had done, even although he had left</li>
<li class="L10200" rel="L10200">it incomplete, presented it before him in an aspect that would be</li>
<li class="L10201" rel="L10201">gratefully acknowledged in France on his presenting himself to assert</li>
<li class="L10202" rel="L10202">it. Then, that glorious vision of doing good, which is so often the</li>
<li class="L10203" rel="L10203">sanguine mirage of so many good minds, arose before him, and he even</li>
<li class="L10204" rel="L10204">saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging</li>
<li class="L10205" rel="L10205">Revolution that was running so fearfully wild.</li>
<li class="L10206" rel="L10206"></li>
<li class="L10207" rel="L10207">As he walked to and fro with his resolution made, he considered that</li>
<li class="L10208" rel="L10208">neither Lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone.</li>
<li class="L10209" rel="L10209">Lucie should be spared the pain of separation; and her father, always</li>
<li class="L10210" rel="L10210">reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old,</li>
<li class="L10211" rel="L10211">should come to the knowledge of the step, as a step taken, and not in</li>
<li class="L10212" rel="L10212">the balance of suspense and doubt. How much of the incompleteness of his</li>
<li class="L10213" rel="L10213">situation was referable to her father, through the painful anxiety</li>
<li class="L10214" rel="L10214">to avoid reviving old associations of France in his mind, he did not</li>
<li class="L10215" rel="L10215">discuss with himself. But, that circumstance too, had had its influence</li>
<li class="L10216" rel="L10216">in his course.</li>
<li class="L10217" rel="L10217"></li>
<li class="L10218" rel="L10218">He walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to</li>
<li class="L10219" rel="L10219">return to Tellson&#39;s and take leave of Mr. Lorry. As soon as he arrived</li>
<li class="L10220" rel="L10220">in Paris he would present himself to this old friend, but he must say</li>
<li class="L10221" rel="L10221">nothing of his intention now.</li>
<li class="L10222" rel="L10222"></li>
<li class="L10223" rel="L10223">A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door, and Jerry was</li>
<li class="L10224" rel="L10224">booted and equipped.</li>
<li class="L10225" rel="L10225"></li>
<li class="L10226" rel="L10226">“I have delivered that letter,” said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry. “I</li>
<li class="L10227" rel="L10227">would not consent to your being charged with any written answer, but</li>
<li class="L10228" rel="L10228">perhaps you will take a verbal one?”</li>
<li class="L10229" rel="L10229"></li>
<li class="L10230" rel="L10230">“That I will, and readily,” said Mr. Lorry, “if it is not dangerous.”</li>
<li class="L10231" rel="L10231"></li>
<li class="L10232" rel="L10232">“Not at all. Though it is to a prisoner in the Abbaye.”</li>
<li class="L10233" rel="L10233"></li>
<li class="L10234" rel="L10234">“What is his name?” said Mr. Lorry, with his open pocket-book in his</li>
<li class="L10235" rel="L10235">hand.</li>
<li class="L10236" rel="L10236"></li>
<li class="L10237" rel="L10237">“Gabelle.”</li>
<li class="L10238" rel="L10238"></li>
<li class="L10239" rel="L10239">“Gabelle. And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison?”</li>
<li class="L10240" rel="L10240"></li>
<li class="L10241" rel="L10241">“Simply, &#39;that he has received the letter, and will come.&#39;”</li>
<li class="L10242" rel="L10242"></li>
<li class="L10243" rel="L10243">“Any time mentioned?”</li>
<li class="L10244" rel="L10244"></li>
<li class="L10245" rel="L10245">“He will start upon his journey to-morrow night.”</li>
<li class="L10246" rel="L10246"></li>
<li class="L10247" rel="L10247">“Any person mentioned?”</li>
<li class="L10248" rel="L10248"></li>
<li class="L10249" rel="L10249">“No.”</li>
<li class="L10250" rel="L10250"></li>
<li class="L10251" rel="L10251">He helped Mr. Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks,</li>
<li class="L10252" rel="L10252">and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old Bank, into the</li>
<li class="L10253" rel="L10253">misty air of Fleet-street. “My love to Lucie, and to little Lucie,” said</li>
<li class="L10254" rel="L10254">Mr. Lorry at parting, “and take precious care of them till I come back.”</li>
<li class="L10255" rel="L10255"> Charles Darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled, as the carriage</li>
<li class="L10256" rel="L10256">rolled away.</li>
<li class="L10257" rel="L10257"></li>
<li class="L10258" rel="L10258">That night--it was the fourteenth of August--he sat up late, and wrote</li>
<li class="L10259" rel="L10259">two fervent letters; one was to Lucie, explaining the strong obligation</li>
<li class="L10260" rel="L10260">he was under to go to Paris, and showing her, at length, the reasons</li>
<li class="L10261" rel="L10261">that he had, for feeling confident that he could become involved in no</li>
<li class="L10262" rel="L10262">personal danger there; the other was to the Doctor, confiding Lucie and</li>
<li class="L10263" rel="L10263">their dear child to his care, and dwelling on the same topics with the</li>
<li class="L10264" rel="L10264">strongest assurances. To both, he wrote that he would despatch letters</li>
<li class="L10265" rel="L10265">in proof of his safety, immediately after his arrival.</li>
<li class="L10266" rel="L10266"></li>
<li class="L10267" rel="L10267">It was a hard day, that day of being among them, with the first</li>
<li class="L10268" rel="L10268">reservation of their joint lives on his mind. It was a hard matter to</li>
<li class="L10269" rel="L10269">preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious.</li>
<li class="L10270" rel="L10270">But, an affectionate glance at his wife, so happy and busy, made him</li>
<li class="L10271" rel="L10271">resolute not to tell her what impended (he had been half moved to do it,</li>
<li class="L10272" rel="L10272">so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid), and</li>
<li class="L10273" rel="L10273">the day passed quickly. Early in the evening he embraced her, and her</li>
<li class="L10274" rel="L10274">scarcely less dear namesake, pretending that he would return by-and-bye</li>
<li class="L10275" rel="L10275">(an imaginary engagement took him out, and he had secreted a valise</li>
<li class="L10276" rel="L10276">of clothes ready), and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy</li>
<li class="L10277" rel="L10277">streets, with a heavier heart.</li>
<li class="L10278" rel="L10278"></li>
<li class="L10279" rel="L10279">The unseen force was drawing him fast to itself, now, and all the tides</li>
<li class="L10280" rel="L10280">and winds were setting straight and strong towards it. He left his</li>
<li class="L10281" rel="L10281">two letters with a trusty porter, to be delivered half an hour before</li>
<li class="L10282" rel="L10282">midnight, and no sooner; took horse for Dover; and began his journey.</li>
<li class="L10283" rel="L10283">“For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of</li>
<li class="L10284" rel="L10284">your noble name!” was the poor prisoner&#39;s cry with which he strengthened</li>
<li class="L10285" rel="L10285">his sinking heart, as he left all that was dear on earth behind him, and</li>
<li class="L10286" rel="L10286">floated away for the Loadstone Rock.</li>

<li class="L10305" rel="L10305">ninety-two. More than enough of bad roads, bad equipages, and bad</li>
<li class="L10306" rel="L10306">horses, he would have encountered to delay him, though the fallen and</li>
<li class="L10307" rel="L10307">unfortunate King of France had been upon his throne in all his glory;</li>
<li class="L10308" rel="L10308">but, the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than</li>
<li class="L10309" rel="L10309">these. Every town-gate and village taxing-house had its band of</li>
<li class="L10310" rel="L10310">citizen-patriots, with their national muskets in a most explosive state</li>
<li class="L10311" rel="L10311">of readiness, who stopped all comers and goers, cross-questioned them,</li>
<li class="L10312" rel="L10312">inspected their papers, looked for their names in lists of their own,</li>
<li class="L10313" rel="L10313">turned them back, or sent them on, or stopped them and laid them in</li>
<li class="L10314" rel="L10314">hold, as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning</li>
<li class="L10315" rel="L10315">Republic One and Indivisible, of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or</li>
<li class="L10316" rel="L10316">Death.</li>
<li class="L10317" rel="L10317"></li>
<li class="L10318" rel="L10318">A very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished, when Charles</li>
<li class="L10319" rel="L10319">Darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there</li>
<li class="L10320" rel="L10320">was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen</li>
<li class="L10321" rel="L10321">at Paris. Whatever might befall now, he must on to his journey&#39;s end.</li>
<li class="L10322" rel="L10322">Not a mean village closed upon him, not a common barrier dropped across</li>
<li class="L10323" rel="L10323">the road behind him, but he knew it to be another iron door in</li>
<li class="L10324" rel="L10324">the series that was barred between him and England. The universal</li>
<li class="L10325" rel="L10325">watchfulness so encompassed him, that if he had been taken in a net,</li>
<li class="L10326" rel="L10326">or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage, he could not have</li>
<li class="L10327" rel="L10327">felt his freedom more completely gone.</li>
<li class="L10328" rel="L10328"></li>
<li class="L10329" rel="L10329">This universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty</li>
<li class="L10330" rel="L10330">times in a stage, but retarded his progress twenty times in a day, by</li>
<li class="L10331" rel="L10331">riding after him and taking him back, riding before him and stopping him</li>
<li class="L10332" rel="L10332">by anticipation, riding with him and keeping him in charge. He had been</li>
<li class="L10333" rel="L10333">days upon his journey in France alone, when he went to bed tired out, in</li>
<li class="L10334" rel="L10334">a little town on the high road, still a long way from Paris.</li>
<li class="L10335" rel="L10335"></li>
<li class="L10336" rel="L10336">Nothing but the production of the afflicted Gabelle&#39;s letter from his</li>
<li class="L10337" rel="L10337">prison of the Abbaye would have got him on so far. His difficulty at the</li>
<li class="L10338" rel="L10338">guard-house in this small place had been such, that he felt his journey</li>
<li class="L10339" rel="L10339">to have come to a crisis. And he was, therefore, as little surprised as</li>
<li class="L10340" rel="L10340">a man could be, to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he</li>
<li class="L10341" rel="L10341">had been remitted until morning, in the middle of the night.</li>
<li class="L10342" rel="L10342"></li>
<li class="L10343" rel="L10343">Awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough</li>
<li class="L10344" rel="L10344">red caps and with pipes in their mouths, who sat down on the bed.</li>
<li class="L10345" rel="L10345"></li>
<li class="L10346" rel="L10346">“Emigrant,” said the functionary, “I am going to send you on to Paris,</li>
<li class="L10347" rel="L10347">under an escort.”</li>
<li class="L10348" rel="L10348"></li>
<li class="L10349" rel="L10349">“Citizen, I desire nothing more than to get to Paris, though I could</li>
<li class="L10350" rel="L10350">dispense with the escort.”</li>
<li class="L10351" rel="L10351"></li>
<li class="L10352" rel="L10352">“Silence!” growled a red-cap, striking at the coverlet with the butt-end</li>
<li class="L10353" rel="L10353">of his musket. “Peace, aristocrat!”</li>
<li class="L10354" rel="L10354"></li>
<li class="L10355" rel="L10355">“It is as the good patriot says,” observed the timid functionary. “You</li>
<li class="L10356" rel="L10356">are an aristocrat, and must have an escort--and must pay for it.”</li>
<li class="L10357" rel="L10357"></li>
<li class="L10358" rel="L10358">“I have no choice,” said Charles Darnay.</li>
<li class="L10359" rel="L10359"></li>
<li class="L10360" rel="L10360">“Choice! Listen to him!” cried the same scowling red-cap. “As if it was</li>
<li class="L10361" rel="L10361">not a favour to be protected from the lamp-iron!”</li>
<li class="L10362" rel="L10362"></li>
<li class="L10363" rel="L10363">“It is always as the good patriot says,” observed the functionary. “Rise</li>
<li class="L10364" rel="L10364">and dress yourself, emigrant.”</li>
<li class="L10365" rel="L10365"></li>
<li class="L10366" rel="L10366">Darnay complied, and was taken back to the guard-house, where other</li>
<li class="L10367" rel="L10367">patriots in rough red caps were smoking, drinking, and sleeping, by</li>
<li class="L10368" rel="L10368">a watch-fire. Here he paid a heavy price for his escort, and hence he</li>
<li class="L10369" rel="L10369">started with it on the wet, wet roads at three o&#39;clock in the morning.</li>
<li class="L10370" rel="L10370"></li>
<li class="L10371" rel="L10371">The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri-coloured</li>
<li class="L10372" rel="L10372">cockades, armed with national muskets and sabres, who rode one on either</li>
<li class="L10373" rel="L10373">side of him.</li>
<li class="L10374" rel="L10374"></li>
<li class="L10375" rel="L10375">The escorted governed his own horse, but a loose line was attached to</li>
<li class="L10376" rel="L10376">his bridle, the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his</li>
<li class="L10377" rel="L10377">wrist. In this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their</li>
<li class="L10378" rel="L10378">faces: clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement,</li>
<li class="L10379" rel="L10379">and out upon the mire-deep roads. In this state they traversed without</li>
<li class="L10380" rel="L10380">change, except of horses and pace, all the mire-deep leagues that lay</li>
<li class="L10381" rel="L10381">between them and the capital.</li>
<li class="L10382" rel="L10382"></li>
<li class="L10383" rel="L10383">They travelled in the night, halting an hour or two after daybreak, and</li>
<li class="L10384" rel="L10384">lying by until the twilight fell. The escort were so wretchedly clothed,</li>
<li class="L10385" rel="L10385">that they twisted straw round their bare legs, and thatched their ragged</li>
<li class="L10386" rel="L10386">shoulders to keep the wet off. Apart from the personal discomfort of</li>
<li class="L10387" rel="L10387">being so attended, and apart from such considerations of present danger</li>
<li class="L10388" rel="L10388">as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk, and carrying</li>
<li class="L10389" rel="L10389">his musket very recklessly, Charles Darnay did not allow the restraint</li>
<li class="L10390" rel="L10390">that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast; for,</li>
<li class="L10391" rel="L10391">he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits</li>
<li class="L10392" rel="L10392">of an individual case that was not yet stated, and of representations,</li>
<li class="L10393" rel="L10393">confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye, that were not yet made.</li>
<li class="L10394" rel="L10394"></li>
<li class="L10395" rel="L10395">But when they came to the town of Beauvais--which they did at eventide,</li>
<li class="L10396" rel="L10396">when the streets were filled with people--he could not conceal from</li>
<li class="L10397" rel="L10397">himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming. An ominous crowd</li>
<li class="L10398" rel="L10398">gathered to see him dismount of the posting-yard, and many voices called</li>
<li class="L10399" rel="L10399">out loudly, “Down with the emigrant!”</li>
<li class="L10400" rel="L10400"></li>
<li class="L10401" rel="L10401">He stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle, and,</li>
<li class="L10402" rel="L10402">resuming it as his safest place, said:</li>
<li class="L10403" rel="L10403"></li>
<li class="L10404" rel="L10404">“Emigrant, my friends! Do you not see me here, in France, of my own</li>
<li class="L10405" rel="L10405">will?”</li>
<li class="L10406" rel="L10406"></li>
<li class="L10407" rel="L10407">“You are a cursed emigrant,” cried a farrier, making at him in a</li>
<li class="L10408" rel="L10408">furious manner through the press, hammer in hand; “and you are a cursed</li>
<li class="L10409" rel="L10409">aristocrat!”</li>
<li class="L10410" rel="L10410"></li>
<li class="L10411" rel="L10411">The postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider&#39;s</li>
<li class="L10412" rel="L10412">bridle (at which he was evidently making), and soothingly said, “Let him</li>
<li class="L10413" rel="L10413">be; let him be! He will be judged at Paris.”</li>
<li class="L10414" rel="L10414"></li>
<li class="L10415" rel="L10415">“Judged!” repeated the farrier, swinging his hammer. “Ay! and condemned</li>
<li class="L10416" rel="L10416">as a traitor.” At this the crowd roared approval.</li>
<li class="L10417" rel="L10417"></li>
<li class="L10418" rel="L10418">Checking the postmaster, who was for turning his horse&#39;s head to the</li>
<li class="L10419" rel="L10419">yard (the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on, with</li>
<li class="L10420" rel="L10420">the line round his wrist), Darnay said, as soon as he could make his</li>
<li class="L10421" rel="L10421">voice heard:</li>
<li class="L10422" rel="L10422"></li>
<li class="L10423" rel="L10423">“Friends, you deceive yourselves, or you are deceived. I am not a</li>
<li class="L10424" rel="L10424">traitor.”</li>
<li class="L10425" rel="L10425"></li>
<li class="L10426" rel="L10426">“He lies!” cried the smith. “He is a traitor since the decree. His life</li>
<li class="L10427" rel="L10427">is forfeit to the people. His cursed life is not his own!”</li>
<li class="L10428" rel="L10428"></li>
<li class="L10429" rel="L10429">At the instant when Darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd, which</li>
<li class="L10430" rel="L10430">another instant would have brought upon him, the postmaster turned his</li>
<li class="L10431" rel="L10431">horse into the yard, the escort rode in close upon his horse&#39;s flanks,</li>
<li class="L10432" rel="L10432">and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates. The farrier</li>
<li class="L10433" rel="L10433">struck a blow upon them with his hammer, and the crowd groaned; but, no</li>
<li class="L10434" rel="L10434">more was done.</li>
<li class="L10435" rel="L10435"></li>
<li class="L10436" rel="L10436">“What is this decree that the smith spoke of?” Darnay asked the</li>
<li class="L10437" rel="L10437">postmaster, when he had thanked him, and stood beside him in the yard.</li>
<li class="L10438" rel="L10438"></li>
<li class="L10439" rel="L10439">“Truly, a decree for selling the property of emigrants.”</li>
<li class="L10440" rel="L10440"></li>
<li class="L10441" rel="L10441">“When passed?”</li>
<li class="L10442" rel="L10442"></li>
<li class="L10443" rel="L10443">“On the fourteenth.”</li>
<li class="L10444" rel="L10444"></li>
<li class="L10445" rel="L10445">“The day I left England!”</li>
<li class="L10446" rel="L10446"></li>
<li class="L10447" rel="L10447">“Everybody says it is but one of several, and that there will be</li>
<li class="L10448" rel="L10448">others--if there are not already--banishing all emigrants, and</li>
<li class="L10449" rel="L10449">condemning all to death who return. That is what he meant when he said</li>
<li class="L10450" rel="L10450">your life was not your own.”</li>
<li class="L10451" rel="L10451"></li>
<li class="L10452" rel="L10452">“But there are no such decrees yet?”</li>
<li class="L10453" rel="L10453"></li>
<li class="L10454" rel="L10454">“What do I know!” said the postmaster, shrugging his shoulders; “there</li>
<li class="L10455" rel="L10455">may be, or there will be. It is all the same. What would you have?”</li>
<li class="L10456" rel="L10456"></li>
<li class="L10457" rel="L10457">They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night, and</li>
<li class="L10458" rel="L10458">then rode forward again when all the town was asleep. Among the many</li>
<li class="L10459" rel="L10459">wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride</li>
<li class="L10460" rel="L10460">unreal, not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep. After long and</li>
<li class="L10461" rel="L10461">lonely spurring over dreary roads, they would come to a cluster of poor</li>
<li class="L10462" rel="L10462">cottages, not steeped in darkness, but all glittering with lights, and</li>
<li class="L10463" rel="L10463">would find the people, in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night,</li>
<li class="L10464" rel="L10464">circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty, or all drawn</li>
<li class="L10465" rel="L10465">up together singing a Liberty song. Happily, however, there was sleep in</li>
<li class="L10466" rel="L10466">Beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more</li>
<li class="L10467" rel="L10467">into solitude and loneliness: jingling through the untimely cold and</li>
<li class="L10468" rel="L10468">wet, among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth</li>
<li class="L10469" rel="L10469">that year, diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses, and by</li>
<li class="L10470" rel="L10470">the sudden emergence from ambuscade, and sharp reining up across their</li>
<li class="L10471" rel="L10471">way, of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads.</li>
<li class="L10472" rel="L10472"></li>
<li class="L10473" rel="L10473">Daylight at last found them before the wall of Paris. The barrier was</li>
<li class="L10474" rel="L10474">closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it.</li>
<li class="L10475" rel="L10475"></li>
<li class="L10476" rel="L10476">“Where are the papers of this prisoner?” demanded a resolute-looking man</li>
<li class="L10477" rel="L10477">in authority, who was summoned out by the guard.</li>
<li class="L10478" rel="L10478"></li>
<li class="L10479" rel="L10479">Naturally struck by the disagreeable word, Charles Darnay requested the</li>
<li class="L10480" rel="L10480">speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and French citizen,</li>
<li class="L10481" rel="L10481">in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had</li>
<li class="L10482" rel="L10482">imposed upon him, and which he had paid for.</li>
<li class="L10483" rel="L10483"></li>
<li class="L10484" rel="L10484">“Where,” repeated the same personage, without taking any heed of him</li>
<li class="L10485" rel="L10485">whatever, “are the papers of this prisoner?”</li>
<li class="L10486" rel="L10486"></li>
<li class="L10487" rel="L10487">The drunken patriot had them in his cap, and produced them. Casting his</li>
<li class="L10488" rel="L10488">eyes over Gabelle&#39;s letter, the same personage in authority showed some</li>
<li class="L10489" rel="L10489">disorder and surprise, and looked at Darnay with a close attention.</li>
<li class="L10490" rel="L10490"></li>
<li class="L10491" rel="L10491">He left escort and escorted without saying a word, however, and went</li>
<li class="L10492" rel="L10492">into the guard-room; meanwhile, they sat upon their horses outside the</li>
<li class="L10493" rel="L10493">gate. Looking about him while in this state of suspense, Charles</li>
<li class="L10494" rel="L10494">Darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and</li>
<li class="L10495" rel="L10495">patriots, the latter far outnumbering the former; and that while ingress</li>
<li class="L10496" rel="L10496">into the city for peasants&#39; carts bringing in supplies, and for similar</li>
<li class="L10497" rel="L10497">traffic and traffickers, was easy enough, egress, even for the homeliest</li>
<li class="L10498" rel="L10498">people, was very difficult. A numerous medley of men and women, not</li>
<li class="L10499" rel="L10499">to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts, was waiting to issue</li>
<li class="L10500" rel="L10500">forth; but, the previous identification was so strict, that they</li>
<li class="L10501" rel="L10501">filtered through the barrier very slowly. Some of these people knew</li>
<li class="L10502" rel="L10502">their turn for examination to be so far off, that they lay down on the</li>
<li class="L10503" rel="L10503">ground to sleep or smoke, while others talked together, or loitered</li>
<li class="L10504" rel="L10504">about. The red cap and tri-colour cockade were universal, both among men</li>
<li class="L10505" rel="L10505">and women.</li>
<li class="L10506" rel="L10506"></li>
<li class="L10507" rel="L10507">When he had sat in his saddle some half-hour, taking note of these</li>
<li class="L10508" rel="L10508">things, Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority,</li>
<li class="L10509" rel="L10509">who directed the guard to open the barrier. Then he delivered to the</li>
<li class="L10510" rel="L10510">escort, drunk and sober, a receipt for the escorted, and requested him</li>
<li class="L10511" rel="L10511">to dismount. He did so, and the two patriots, leading his tired horse,</li>
<li class="L10512" rel="L10512">turned and rode away without entering the city.</li>
<li class="L10513" rel="L10513"></li>
<li class="L10514" rel="L10514">He accompanied his conductor into a guard-room, smelling of common wine</li>
<li class="L10515" rel="L10515">and tobacco, where certain soldiers and patriots, asleep and awake,</li>
<li class="L10516" rel="L10516">drunk and sober, and in various neutral states between sleeping and</li>
<li class="L10517" rel="L10517">waking, drunkenness and sobriety, were standing and lying about. The</li>
<li class="L10518" rel="L10518">light in the guard-house, half derived from the waning oil-lamps of</li>
<li class="L10519" rel="L10519">the night, and half from the overcast day, was in a correspondingly</li>
<li class="L10520" rel="L10520">uncertain condition. Some registers were lying open on a desk, and an</li>
<li class="L10521" rel="L10521">officer of a coarse, dark aspect, presided over these.</li>
<li class="L10522" rel="L10522"></li>
<li class="L10523" rel="L10523">“Citizen Defarge,” said he to Darnay&#39;s conductor, as he took a slip of</li>
<li class="L10524" rel="L10524">paper to write on. “Is this the emigrant Evremonde?”</li>
<li class="L10525" rel="L10525"></li>
<li class="L10526" rel="L10526">“This is the man.”</li>
<li class="L10527" rel="L10527"></li>
<li class="L10528" rel="L10528">“Your age, Evremonde?”</li>
<li class="L10529" rel="L10529"></li>
<li class="L10530" rel="L10530">“Thirty-seven.”</li>
<li class="L10531" rel="L10531"></li>
<li class="L10532" rel="L10532">“Married, Evremonde?”</li>
<li class="L10533" rel="L10533"></li>
<li class="L10534" rel="L10534">“Yes.”</li>
<li class="L10535" rel="L10535"></li>
<li class="L10536" rel="L10536">“Where married?”</li>
<li class="L10537" rel="L10537"></li>
<li class="L10538" rel="L10538">“In England.”</li>
<li class="L10539" rel="L10539"></li>
<li class="L10540" rel="L10540">“Without doubt. Where is your wife, Evremonde?”</li>
<li class="L10541" rel="L10541"></li>
<li class="L10542" rel="L10542">“In England.”</li>
<li class="L10543" rel="L10543"></li>
<li class="L10544" rel="L10544">“Without doubt. You are consigned, Evremonde, to the prison of La</li>
<li class="L10545" rel="L10545">Force.”</li>
<li class="L10546" rel="L10546"></li>
<li class="L10547" rel="L10547">“Just Heaven!” exclaimed Darnay. “Under what law, and for what offence?”</li>
<li class="L10548" rel="L10548"></li>
<li class="L10549" rel="L10549">The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment.</li>
<li class="L10550" rel="L10550"></li>
<li class="L10551" rel="L10551">“We have new laws, Evremonde, and new offences, since you were here.” He</li>
<li class="L10552" rel="L10552">said it with a hard smile, and went on writing.</li>
<li class="L10553" rel="L10553"></li>
<li class="L10554" rel="L10554">“I entreat you to observe that I have come here voluntarily, in response</li>
<li class="L10555" rel="L10555">to that written appeal of a fellow-countryman which lies before you. I</li>
<li class="L10556" rel="L10556">demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay. Is not that</li>
<li class="L10557" rel="L10557">my right?”</li>
<li class="L10558" rel="L10558"></li>
<li class="L10559" rel="L10559">“Emigrants have no rights, Evremonde,” was the stolid reply. The officer</li>
<li class="L10560" rel="L10560">wrote until he had finished, read over to himself what he had written,</li>
<li class="L10561" rel="L10561">sanded it, and handed it to Defarge, with the words “In secret.”</li>
<li class="L10562" rel="L10562"></li>
<li class="L10563" rel="L10563">Defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany</li>
<li class="L10564" rel="L10564">him. The prisoner obeyed, and a guard of two armed patriots attended</li>
<li class="L10565" rel="L10565">them.</li>
<li class="L10566" rel="L10566"></li>
<li class="L10567" rel="L10567">“Is it you,” said Defarge, in a low voice, as they went down the</li>
<li class="L10568" rel="L10568">guardhouse steps and turned into Paris, “who married the daughter of</li>
<li class="L10569" rel="L10569">Doctor Manette, once a prisoner in the Bastille that is no more?”</li>
<li class="L10570" rel="L10570"></li>
<li class="L10571" rel="L10571">“Yes,” replied Darnay, looking at him with surprise.</li>
<li class="L10572" rel="L10572"></li>
<li class="L10573" rel="L10573">“My name is Defarge, and I keep a wine-shop in the Quarter Saint</li>
<li class="L10574" rel="L10574">Antoine. Possibly you have heard of me.”</li>
<li class="L10575" rel="L10575"></li>
<li class="L10576" rel="L10576">“My wife came to your house to reclaim her father? Yes!”</li>
<li class="L10577" rel="L10577"></li>
<li class="L10578" rel="L10578">The word “wife” seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge, to say</li>
<li class="L10579" rel="L10579">with sudden impatience, “In the name of that sharp female newly-born,</li>
<li class="L10580" rel="L10580">and called La Guillotine, why did you come to France?”</li>
<li class="L10581" rel="L10581"></li>
<li class="L10582" rel="L10582">“You heard me say why, a minute ago. Do you not believe it is the</li>
<li class="L10583" rel="L10583">truth?”</li>
<li class="L10584" rel="L10584"></li>
<li class="L10585" rel="L10585">“A bad truth for you,” said Defarge, speaking with knitted brows, and</li>
<li class="L10586" rel="L10586">looking straight before him.</li>
<li class="L10587" rel="L10587"></li>
<li class="L10588" rel="L10588">“Indeed I am lost here. All here is so unprecedented, so changed, so</li>
<li class="L10589" rel="L10589">sudden and unfair, that I am absolutely lost. Will you render me a</li>
<li class="L10590" rel="L10590">little help?”</li>
<li class="L10591" rel="L10591"></li>
<li class="L10592" rel="L10592">“None.” Defarge spoke, always looking straight before him.</li>
<li class="L10593" rel="L10593"></li>
<li class="L10594" rel="L10594">“Will you answer me a single question?”</li>
<li class="L10595" rel="L10595"></li>
<li class="L10596" rel="L10596">“Perhaps. According to its nature. You can say what it is.”</li>
<li class="L10597" rel="L10597"></li>
<li class="L10598" rel="L10598">“In this prison that I am going to so unjustly, shall I have some free</li>
<li class="L10599" rel="L10599">communication with the world outside?”</li>
<li class="L10600" rel="L10600"></li>
<li class="L10601" rel="L10601">“You will see.”</li>
<li class="L10602" rel="L10602"></li>
<li class="L10603" rel="L10603">“I am not to be buried there, prejudged, and without any means of</li>
<li class="L10604" rel="L10604">presenting my case?”</li>
<li class="L10605" rel="L10605"></li>
<li class="L10606" rel="L10606">“You will see. But, what then? Other people have been similarly buried</li>
<li class="L10607" rel="L10607">in worse prisons, before now.”</li>
<li class="L10608" rel="L10608"></li>
<li class="L10609" rel="L10609">“But never by me, Citizen Defarge.”</li>
<li class="L10610" rel="L10610"></li>
<li class="L10611" rel="L10611">Defarge glanced darkly at him for answer, and walked on in a steady</li>
<li class="L10612" rel="L10612">and set silence. The deeper he sank into this silence, the fainter hope</li>
<li class="L10613" rel="L10613">there was--or so Darnay thought--of his softening in any slight degree.</li>
<li class="L10614" rel="L10614">He, therefore, made haste to say:</li>
<li class="L10615" rel="L10615"></li>
<li class="L10616" rel="L10616">“It is of the utmost importance to me (you know, Citizen, even better</li>
<li class="L10617" rel="L10617">than I, of how much importance), that I should be able to communicate to</li>
<li class="L10618" rel="L10618">Mr. Lorry of Tellson&#39;s Bank, an English gentleman who is now in Paris,</li>
<li class="L10619" rel="L10619">the simple fact, without comment, that I have been thrown into the</li>
<li class="L10620" rel="L10620">prison of La Force. Will you cause that to be done for me?”</li>
<li class="L10621" rel="L10621"></li>
<li class="L10622" rel="L10622">“I will do,” Defarge doggedly rejoined, “nothing for you. My duty is to</li>
<li class="L10623" rel="L10623">my country and the People. I am the sworn servant of both, against you.</li>
<li class="L10624" rel="L10624">I will do nothing for you.”</li>
<li class="L10625" rel="L10625"></li>
<li class="L10626" rel="L10626">Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further, and his pride</li>
<li class="L10627" rel="L10627">was touched besides. As they walked on in silence, he could not but see</li>
<li class="L10628" rel="L10628">how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the</li>
<li class="L10629" rel="L10629">streets. The very children scarcely noticed him. A few passers turned</li>
<li class="L10630" rel="L10630">their heads, and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat;</li>
<li class="L10631" rel="L10631">otherwise, that a man in good clothes should be going to prison, was no</li>
<li class="L10632" rel="L10632">more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be</li>
<li class="L10633" rel="L10633">going to work. In one narrow, dark, and dirty street through which they</li>
<li class="L10634" rel="L10634">passed, an excited orator, mounted on a stool, was addressing an excited</li>
<li class="L10635" rel="L10635">audience on the crimes against the people, of the king and the royal</li>
<li class="L10636" rel="L10636">family. The few words that he caught from this man&#39;s lips, first made</li>
<li class="L10637" rel="L10637">it known to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison, and that the</li>
<li class="L10638" rel="L10638">foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris. On the road (except at</li>
<li class="L10639" rel="L10639">Beauvais) he had heard absolutely nothing. The escort and the universal</li>
<li class="L10640" rel="L10640">watchfulness had completely isolated him.</li>
<li class="L10641" rel="L10641"></li>
<li class="L10642" rel="L10642">That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had</li>
<li class="L10643" rel="L10643">developed themselves when he left England, he of course knew now. That</li>
<li class="L10644" rel="L10644">perils had thickened about him fast, and might thicken faster and faster</li>
<li class="L10645" rel="L10645">yet, he of course knew now. He could not but admit to himself that he</li>
<li class="L10646" rel="L10646">might not have made this journey, if he could have foreseen the events</li>
<li class="L10647" rel="L10647">of a few days. And yet his misgivings were not so dark as, imagined by</li>
<li class="L10648" rel="L10648">the light of this later time, they would appear. Troubled as the future</li>
<li class="L10649" rel="L10649">was, it was the unknown future, and in its obscurity there was ignorant</li>
<li class="L10650" rel="L10650">hope. The horrible massacre, days and nights long, which, within a few</li>
<li class="L10651" rel="L10651">rounds of the clock, was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed</li>
<li class="L10652" rel="L10652">garnering time of harvest, was as far out of his knowledge as if it had</li>
<li class="L10653" rel="L10653">been a hundred thousand years away. The “sharp female newly-born, and</li>
<li class="L10654" rel="L10654">called La Guillotine,” was hardly known to him, or to the generality</li>
<li class="L10655" rel="L10655">of people, by name. The frightful deeds that were to be soon done, were</li>
<li class="L10656" rel="L10656">probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers. How could</li>
<li class="L10657" rel="L10657">they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind?</li>
<li class="L10658" rel="L10658"></li>
<li class="L10659" rel="L10659">Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship, and in cruel separation</li>
<li class="L10660" rel="L10660">from his wife and child, he foreshadowed the likelihood, or the</li>
<li class="L10661" rel="L10661">certainty; but, beyond this, he dreaded nothing distinctly. With this on</li>
<li class="L10662" rel="L10662">his mind, which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard, he</li>
<li class="L10663" rel="L10663">arrived at the prison of La Force.</li>
<li class="L10664" rel="L10664"></li>
<li class="L10665" rel="L10665">A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket, to whom Defarge</li>
<li class="L10666" rel="L10666">presented “The Emigrant Evremonde.”</li>
<li class="L10667" rel="L10667"></li>
<li class="L10668" rel="L10668">“What the Devil! How many more of them!” exclaimed the man with the</li>
<li class="L10669" rel="L10669">bloated face.</li>
<li class="L10670" rel="L10670"></li>
<li class="L10671" rel="L10671">Defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation, and withdrew,</li>
<li class="L10672" rel="L10672">with his two fellow-patriots.</li>
<li class="L10673" rel="L10673"></li>
<li class="L10674" rel="L10674">“What the Devil, I say again!” exclaimed the gaoler, left with his wife.</li>
<li class="L10675" rel="L10675">“How many more!”</li>
<li class="L10676" rel="L10676"></li>
<li class="L10677" rel="L10677">The gaoler&#39;s wife, being provided with no answer to the question, merely</li>
<li class="L10678" rel="L10678">replied, “One must have patience, my dear!” Three turnkeys who entered</li>
<li class="L10679" rel="L10679">responsive to a bell she rang, echoed the sentiment, and one added, “For</li>
<li class="L10680" rel="L10680">the love of Liberty;” which sounded in that place like an inappropriate</li>
<li class="L10681" rel="L10681">conclusion.</li>
<li class="L10682" rel="L10682"></li>
<li class="L10683" rel="L10683">The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison, dark and filthy, and with a</li>
<li class="L10684" rel="L10684">horrible smell of foul sleep in it. Extraordinary how soon the noisome</li>
<li class="L10685" rel="L10685">flavour of imprisoned sleep, becomes manifest in all such places that</li>
<li class="L10686" rel="L10686">are ill cared for!</li>
<li class="L10687" rel="L10687"></li>
<li class="L10688" rel="L10688">“In secret, too,” grumbled the gaoler, looking at the written paper. “As</li>
<li class="L10689" rel="L10689">if I was not already full to bursting!”</li>
<li class="L10690" rel="L10690"></li>
<li class="L10691" rel="L10691">He stuck the paper on a file, in an ill-humour, and Charles Darnay</li>
<li class="L10692" rel="L10692">awaited his further pleasure for half an hour: sometimes, pacing to and</li>
<li class="L10693" rel="L10693">fro in the strong arched room: sometimes, resting on a stone seat: in</li>
<li class="L10694" rel="L10694">either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his</li>
<li class="L10695" rel="L10695">subordinates.</li>
<li class="L10696" rel="L10696"></li>
<li class="L10697" rel="L10697">“Come!” said the chief, at length taking up his keys, “come with me,</li>
<li class="L10698" rel="L10698">emigrant.”</li>
<li class="L10699" rel="L10699"></li>
<li class="L10700" rel="L10700">Through the dismal prison twilight, his new charge accompanied him by</li>
<li class="L10701" rel="L10701">corridor and staircase, many doors clanging and locking behind them,</li>
<li class="L10702" rel="L10702">until they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with</li>
<li class="L10703" rel="L10703">prisoners of both sexes. The women were seated at a long table, reading</li>
<li class="L10704" rel="L10704">and writing, knitting, sewing, and embroidering; the men were for the</li>
<li class="L10705" rel="L10705">most part standing behind their chairs, or lingering up and down the</li>
<li class="L10706" rel="L10706">room.</li>
<li class="L10707" rel="L10707"></li>
<li class="L10708" rel="L10708">In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and</li>
<li class="L10709" rel="L10709">disgrace, the new-comer recoiled from this company. But the crowning</li>
<li class="L10710" rel="L10710">unreality of his long unreal ride, was, their all at once rising to</li>
<li class="L10711" rel="L10711">receive him, with every refinement of manner known to the time, and with</li>
<li class="L10712" rel="L10712">all the engaging graces and courtesies of life.</li>
<li class="L10713" rel="L10713"></li>
<li class="L10714" rel="L10714">So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and</li>
<li class="L10715" rel="L10715">gloom, so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and</li>
<li class="L10716" rel="L10716">misery through which they were seen, that Charles Darnay seemed to stand</li>
<li class="L10717" rel="L10717">in a company of the dead. Ghosts all! The ghost of beauty, the ghost</li>
<li class="L10718" rel="L10718">of stateliness, the ghost of elegance, the ghost of pride, the ghost of</li>
<li class="L10719" rel="L10719">frivolity, the ghost of wit, the ghost of youth, the ghost of age, all</li>
<li class="L10720" rel="L10720">waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore, all turning on him eyes</li>
<li class="L10721" rel="L10721">that were changed by the death they had died in coming there.</li>
<li class="L10722" rel="L10722"></li>
<li class="L10723" rel="L10723">It struck him motionless. The gaoler standing at his side, and the other</li>
<li class="L10724" rel="L10724">gaolers moving about, who would have been well enough as to appearance</li>
<li class="L10725" rel="L10725">in the ordinary exercise of their functions, looked so extravagantly</li>
<li class="L10726" rel="L10726">coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were</li>
<li class="L10727" rel="L10727">there--with the apparitions of the coquette, the young beauty, and the</li>
<li class="L10728" rel="L10728">mature woman delicately bred--that the inversion of all experience and</li>
<li class="L10729" rel="L10729">likelihood which the scene of shadows presented, was heightened to its</li>
<li class="L10730" rel="L10730">utmost. Surely, ghosts all. Surely, the long unreal ride some progress</li>
<li class="L10731" rel="L10731">of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades!</li>
<li class="L10732" rel="L10732"></li>
<li class="L10733" rel="L10733">“In the name of the assembled companions in misfortune,” said a</li>
<li class="L10734" rel="L10734">gentleman of courtly appearance and address, coming forward, “I have the</li>
<li class="L10735" rel="L10735">honour of giving you welcome to La Force, and of condoling with you</li>
<li class="L10736" rel="L10736">on the calamity that has brought you among us. May it soon terminate</li>
<li class="L10737" rel="L10737">happily! It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so here,</li>
<li class="L10738" rel="L10738">to ask your name and condition?”</li>
<li class="L10739" rel="L10739"></li>
<li class="L10740" rel="L10740">Charles Darnay roused himself, and gave the required information, in</li>
<li class="L10741" rel="L10741">words as suitable as he could find.</li>
<li class="L10742" rel="L10742"></li>
<li class="L10743" rel="L10743">“But I hope,” said the gentleman, following the chief gaoler with his</li>
<li class="L10744" rel="L10744">eyes, who moved across the room, “that you are not in secret?”</li>
<li class="L10745" rel="L10745"></li>
<li class="L10746" rel="L10746">“I do not understand the meaning of the term, but I have heard them say</li>
<li class="L10747" rel="L10747">so.”</li>
<li class="L10748" rel="L10748"></li>
<li class="L10749" rel="L10749">“Ah, what a pity! We so much regret it! But take courage; several</li>
<li class="L10750" rel="L10750">members of our society have been in secret, at first, and it has lasted</li>
<li class="L10751" rel="L10751">but a short time.” Then he added, raising his voice, “I grieve to inform</li>
<li class="L10752" rel="L10752">the society--in secret.”</li>
<li class="L10753" rel="L10753"></li>
<li class="L10754" rel="L10754">There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed the room</li>
<li class="L10755" rel="L10755">to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him, and many voices--among</li>
<li class="L10756" rel="L10756">which, the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous--gave</li>
<li class="L10757" rel="L10757">him good wishes and encouragement. He turned at the grated door, to</li>
<li class="L10758" rel="L10758">render the thanks of his heart; it closed under the gaoler&#39;s hand; and</li>
<li class="L10759" rel="L10759">the apparitions vanished from his sight forever.</li>
<li class="L10760" rel="L10760"></li>
<li class="L10761" rel="L10761">The wicket opened on a stone staircase, leading upward. When they had</li>
<li class="L10762" rel="L10762">ascended forty steps (the prisoner of half an hour already counted</li>
<li class="L10763" rel="L10763">them), the gaoler opened a low black door, and they passed into a</li>
<li class="L10764" rel="L10764">solitary cell. It struck cold and damp, but was not dark.</li>
<li class="L10765" rel="L10765"></li>
<li class="L10766" rel="L10766">“Yours,” said the gaoler.</li>
<li class="L10767" rel="L10767"></li>
<li class="L10768" rel="L10768">“Why am I confined alone?”</li>
<li class="L10769" rel="L10769"></li>
<li class="L10770" rel="L10770">“How do I know!”</li>
<li class="L10771" rel="L10771"></li>
<li class="L10772" rel="L10772">“I can buy pen, ink, and paper?”</li>
<li class="L10773" rel="L10773"></li>
<li class="L10774" rel="L10774">“Such are not my orders. You will be visited, and can ask then. At</li>
<li class="L10775" rel="L10775">present, you may buy your food, and nothing more.”</li>
<li class="L10776" rel="L10776"></li>
<li class="L10777" rel="L10777">There were in the cell, a chair, a table, and a straw mattress. As</li>
<li class="L10778" rel="L10778">the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects, and of the four</li>
<li class="L10779" rel="L10779">walls, before going out, a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of</li>
<li class="L10780" rel="L10780">the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him, that this gaoler</li>
<li class="L10781" rel="L10781">was so unwholesomely bloated, both in face and person, as to look like</li>
<li class="L10782" rel="L10782">a man who had been drowned and filled with water. When the gaoler was</li>
<li class="L10783" rel="L10783">gone, he thought in the same wandering way, “Now am I left, as if I were</li>
<li class="L10784" rel="L10784">dead.” Stopping then, to look down at the mattress, he turned from it</li>
<li class="L10785" rel="L10785">with a sick feeling, and thought, “And here in these crawling creatures</li>
<li class="L10786" rel="L10786">is the first condition of the body after death.”</li>
<li class="L10787" rel="L10787"></li>
<li class="L10788" rel="L10788">“Five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half, five</li>
<li class="L10789" rel="L10789">paces by four and a half.” The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell,</li>
<li class="L10790" rel="L10790">counting its measurement, and the roar of the city arose like muffled</li>
<li class="L10791" rel="L10791">drums with a wild swell of voices added to them. “He made shoes, he made</li>
<li class="L10792" rel="L10792">shoes, he made shoes.” The prisoner counted the measurement again, and</li>
<li class="L10793" rel="L10793">paced faster, to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition.</li>
<li class="L10794" rel="L10794">“The ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed. There was one among</li>
<li class="L10795" rel="L10795">them, the appearance of a lady dressed in black, who was leaning in the</li>
<li class="L10796" rel="L10796">embrasure of a window, and she had a light shining upon her golden</li>
<li class="L10797" rel="L10797">hair, and she looked like * * * * Let us ride on again, for God&#39;s sake,</li>
<li class="L10798" rel="L10798">through the illuminated villages with the people all awake! * * * * He</li>
<li class="L10799" rel="L10799">made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes. * * * * Five paces by four and</li>
<li class="L10800" rel="L10800">a half.” With such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of</li>
<li class="L10801" rel="L10801">his mind, the prisoner walked faster and faster, obstinately counting</li>
<li class="L10802" rel="L10802">and counting; and the roar of the city changed to this extent--that it</li>
<li class="L10803" rel="L10803">still rolled in like muffled drums, but with the wail of voices that he</li>
<li class="L10804" rel="L10804">knew, in the swell that rose above them.</li>
<li class="L10805" rel="L10805"></li>
<li class="L10806" rel="L10806"></li>
<li class="L10807" rel="L10807"></li>
<li class="L10808" rel="L10808"></li>
<li class="L10809" rel="L10809">II. The Grindstone</li>
<li class="L10810" rel="L10810"></li>
<li class="L10811" rel="L10811"></li>
<li class="L10812" rel="L10812">Tellson&#39;s Bank, established in the Saint Germain Quarter of Paris, was</li>
<li class="L10813" rel="L10813">in a wing of a large house, approached by a courtyard and shut off from</li>
<li class="L10814" rel="L10814">the street by a high wall and a strong gate. The house belonged to</li>
<li class="L10815" rel="L10815">a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the</li>
<li class="L10816" rel="L10816">troubles, in his own cook&#39;s dress, and got across the borders. A</li>
<li class="L10817" rel="L10817">mere beast of the chase flying from hunters, he was still in his</li>
<li class="L10818" rel="L10818">metempsychosis no other than the same Monseigneur, the preparation</li>
<li class="L10819" rel="L10819">of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men</li>
<li class="L10820" rel="L10820">besides the cook in question.</li>
<li class="L10821" rel="L10821"></li>
<li class="L10822" rel="L10822">Monseigneur gone, and the three strong men absolving themselves from the</li>
<li class="L10823" rel="L10823">sin of having drawn his high wages, by being more than ready and</li>
<li class="L10824" rel="L10824">willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning Republic one and</li>
<li class="L10825" rel="L10825">indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, Monseigneur&#39;s</li>
<li class="L10826" rel="L10826">house had been first sequestrated, and then confiscated. For, all</li>
<li class="L10827" rel="L10827">things moved so fast, and decree followed decree with that fierce</li>
<li class="L10828" rel="L10828">precipitation, that now upon the third night of the autumn month</li>
<li class="L10829" rel="L10829">of September, patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of</li>
<li class="L10830" rel="L10830">Monseigneur&#39;s house, and had marked it with the tri-colour, and were</li>
<li class="L10831" rel="L10831">drinking brandy in its state apartments.</li>
<li class="L10832" rel="L10832"></li>
<li class="L10833" rel="L10833">A place of business in London like Tellson&#39;s place of business in Paris,</li>
<li class="L10834" rel="L10834">would soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette.</li>
<li class="L10835" rel="L10835">For, what would staid British responsibility and respectability have</li>
<li class="L10836" rel="L10836">said to orange-trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard, and even to a Cupid</li>
<li class="L10837" rel="L10837">over the counter? Yet such things were. Tellson&#39;s had whitewashed the</li>
<li class="L10838" rel="L10838">Cupid, but he was still to be seen on the ceiling, in the coolest</li>
<li class="L10839" rel="L10839">linen, aiming (as he very often does) at money from morning to</li>
<li class="L10840" rel="L10840">night. Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young Pagan, in</li>
<li class="L10841" rel="L10841">Lombard-street, London, and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of</li>
<li class="L10842" rel="L10842">the immortal boy, and also of a looking-glass let into the wall, and</li>
<li class="L10843" rel="L10843">also of clerks not at all old, who danced in public on the slightest</li>
<li class="L10844" rel="L10844">provocation. Yet, a French Tellson&#39;s could get on with these things</li>
<li class="L10845" rel="L10845">exceedingly well, and, as long as the times held together, no man had</li>
<li class="L10846" rel="L10846">taken fright at them, and drawn out his money.</li>
<li class="L10847" rel="L10847"></li>
<li class="L10848" rel="L10848">What money would be drawn out of Tellson&#39;s henceforth, and what would</li>
<li class="L10849" rel="L10849">lie there, lost and forgotten; what plate and jewels would tarnish in</li>
<li class="L10850" rel="L10850">Tellson&#39;s hiding-places, while the depositors rusted in prisons,</li>
<li class="L10851" rel="L10851">and when they should have violently perished; how many accounts with</li>
<li class="L10852" rel="L10852">Tellson&#39;s never to be balanced in this world, must be carried over into</li>
<li class="L10853" rel="L10853">the next; no man could have said, that night, any more than Mr. Jarvis</li>
<li class="L10854" rel="L10854">Lorry could, though he thought heavily of these questions. He sat by</li>
<li class="L10855" rel="L10855">a newly-lighted wood fire (the blighted and unfruitful year was</li>
<li class="L10856" rel="L10856">prematurely cold), and on his honest and courageous face there was a</li>
<li class="L10857" rel="L10857">deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw, or any object in the</li>
<li class="L10858" rel="L10858">room distortedly reflect--a shade of horror.</li>
<li class="L10859" rel="L10859"></li>
<li class="L10860" rel="L10860">He occupied rooms in the Bank, in his fidelity to the House of which</li>
<li class="L10861" rel="L10861">he had grown to be a part, like strong root-ivy. It chanced that they</li>
<li class="L10862" rel="L10862">derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main</li>
<li class="L10863" rel="L10863">building, but the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about</li>
<li class="L10864" rel="L10864">that. All such circumstances were indifferent to him, so that he did</li>
<li class="L10865" rel="L10865">his duty. On the opposite side of the courtyard, under a colonnade,</li>
<li class="L10866" rel="L10866">was extensive standing--for carriages--where, indeed, some carriages</li>
<li class="L10867" rel="L10867">of Monseigneur yet stood. Against two of the pillars were fastened two</li>
<li class="L10868" rel="L10868">great flaring flambeaux, and in the light of these, standing out in the</li>
<li class="L10869" rel="L10869">open air, was a large grindstone: a roughly mounted thing which appeared</li>
<li class="L10870" rel="L10870">to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy,</li>
<li class="L10871" rel="L10871">or other workshop. Rising and looking out of window at these harmless</li>
<li class="L10872" rel="L10872">objects, Mr. Lorry shivered, and retired to his seat by the fire. He had</li>
<li class="L10873" rel="L10873">opened, not only the glass window, but the lattice blind outside it, and</li>
<li class="L10874" rel="L10874">he had closed both again, and he shivered through his frame.</li>
<li class="L10875" rel="L10875"></li>
<li class="L10876" rel="L10876">From the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate, there came</li>
<li class="L10877" rel="L10877">the usual night hum of the city, with now and then an indescribable ring</li>
<li class="L10878" rel="L10878">in it, weird and unearthly, as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible</li>
<li class="L10879" rel="L10879">nature were going up to Heaven.</li>
<li class="L10880" rel="L10880"></li>
<li class="L10881" rel="L10881">“Thank God,” said Mr. Lorry, clasping his hands, “that no one near and</li>
<li class="L10882" rel="L10882">dear to me is in this dreadful town to-night. May He have mercy on all</li>
<li class="L10883" rel="L10883">who are in danger!”</li>
<li class="L10884" rel="L10884"></li>
<li class="L10885" rel="L10885">Soon afterwards, the bell at the great gate sounded, and he thought,</li>
<li class="L10886" rel="L10886">“They have come back!” and sat listening. But, there was no loud</li>
<li class="L10887" rel="L10887">irruption into the courtyard, as he had expected, and he heard the gate</li>
<li class="L10888" rel="L10888">clash again, and all was quiet.</li>
<li class="L10889" rel="L10889"></li>
<li class="L10890" rel="L10890">The nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague</li>
<li class="L10891" rel="L10891">uneasiness respecting the Bank, which a great change would naturally</li>
<li class="L10892" rel="L10892">awaken, with such feelings roused. It was well guarded, and he got up to</li>
<li class="L10893" rel="L10893">go among the trusty people who were watching it, when his door suddenly</li>
<li class="L10894" rel="L10894">opened, and two figures rushed in, at sight of which he fell back in</li>
<li class="L10895" rel="L10895">amazement.</li>
<li class="L10896" rel="L10896"></li>
<li class="L10897" rel="L10897">Lucie and her father! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him, and with</li>
<li class="L10898" rel="L10898">that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it</li>
<li class="L10899" rel="L10899">seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give</li>
<li class="L10900" rel="L10900">force and power to it in this one passage of her life.</li>
<li class="L10901" rel="L10901"></li>
<li class="L10902" rel="L10902">“What is this?” cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. “What is the</li>
<li class="L10903" rel="L10903">matter? Lucie! Manette! What has happened? What has brought you here?</li>
<li class="L10904" rel="L10904">What is it?”</li>
<li class="L10905" rel="L10905"></li>
<li class="L10906" rel="L10906">With the look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she panted</li>
<li class="L10907" rel="L10907">out in his arms, imploringly, “O my dear friend! My husband!”</li>
<li class="L10908" rel="L10908"></li>
<li class="L10909" rel="L10909">“Your husband, Lucie?”</li>
<li class="L10910" rel="L10910"></li>
<li class="L10911" rel="L10911">“Charles.”</li>
<li class="L10912" rel="L10912"></li>
<li class="L10913" rel="L10913">“What of Charles?”</li>
<li class="L10914" rel="L10914"></li>
<li class="L10915" rel="L10915">“Here.</li>
<li class="L10916" rel="L10916"></li>
<li class="L10917" rel="L10917">“Here, in Paris?”</li>
<li class="L10918" rel="L10918"></li>
<li class="L10919" rel="L10919">“Has been here some days--three or four--I don&#39;t know how many--I can&#39;t</li>
<li class="L10920" rel="L10920">collect my thoughts. An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to</li>
<li class="L10921" rel="L10921">us; he was stopped at the barrier, and sent to prison.”</li>
<li class="L10922" rel="L10922"></li>
<li class="L10923" rel="L10923">The old man uttered an irrepressible cry. Almost at the same moment, the</li>
<li class="L10924" rel="L10924">bell of the great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and voices</li>
<li class="L10925" rel="L10925">came pouring into the courtyard.</li>
<li class="L10926" rel="L10926"></li>
<li class="L10927" rel="L10927">“What is that noise?” said the Doctor, turning towards the window.</li>
<li class="L10928" rel="L10928"></li>
<li class="L10929" rel="L10929">“Don&#39;t look!” cried Mr. Lorry. “Don&#39;t look out! Manette, for your life,</li>
<li class="L10930" rel="L10930">don&#39;t touch the blind!”</li>
<li class="L10931" rel="L10931"></li>
<li class="L10932" rel="L10932">The Doctor turned, with his hand upon the fastening of the window, and</li>
<li class="L10933" rel="L10933">said, with a cool, bold smile:</li>
<li class="L10934" rel="L10934"></li>
<li class="L10935" rel="L10935">“My dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city. I have been</li>
<li class="L10936" rel="L10936">a Bastille prisoner. There is no patriot in Paris--in Paris? In</li>
<li class="L10937" rel="L10937">France--who, knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille, would</li>
<li class="L10938" rel="L10938">touch me, except to overwhelm me with embraces, or carry me in triumph.</li>
<li class="L10939" rel="L10939">My old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the</li>
<li class="L10940" rel="L10940">barrier, and gained us news of Charles there, and brought us here. I</li>
<li class="L10941" rel="L10941">knew it would be so; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger; I</li>
<li class="L10942" rel="L10942">told Lucie so.--What is that noise?” His hand was again upon the window.</li>
<li class="L10943" rel="L10943"></li>
<li class="L10944" rel="L10944">“Don&#39;t look!” cried Mr. Lorry, absolutely desperate. “No, Lucie, my</li>
<li class="L10945" rel="L10945">dear, nor you!” He got his arm round her, and held her. “Don&#39;t be so</li>
<li class="L10946" rel="L10946">terrified, my love. I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm</li>
<li class="L10947" rel="L10947">having happened to Charles; that I had no suspicion even of his being in</li>
<li class="L10948" rel="L10948">this fatal place. What prison is he in?”</li>
<li class="L10949" rel="L10949"></li>
<li class="L10950" rel="L10950">“La Force!”</li>
<li class="L10951" rel="L10951"></li>
<li class="L10952" rel="L10952">“La Force! Lucie, my child, if ever you were brave and serviceable in</li>
<li class="L10953" rel="L10953">your life--and you were always both--you will compose yourself now, to</li>
<li class="L10954" rel="L10954">do exactly as I bid you; for more depends upon it than you can think, or</li>
<li class="L10955" rel="L10955">I can say. There is no help for you in any action on your part to-night;</li>
<li class="L10956" rel="L10956">you cannot possibly stir out. I say this, because what I must bid you</li>
<li class="L10957" rel="L10957">to do for Charles&#39;s sake, is the hardest thing to do of all. You must</li>
<li class="L10958" rel="L10958">instantly be obedient, still, and quiet. You must let me put you in a</li>
<li class="L10959" rel="L10959">room at the back here. You must leave your father and me alone for</li>
<li class="L10960" rel="L10960">two minutes, and as there are Life and Death in the world you must not</li>
<li class="L10961" rel="L10961">delay.”</li>
<li class="L10962" rel="L10962"></li>
<li class="L10963" rel="L10963">“I will be submissive to you. I see in your face that you know I can do</li>
<li class="L10964" rel="L10964">nothing else than this. I know you are true.”</li>
<li class="L10965" rel="L10965"></li>
<li class="L10966" rel="L10966">The old man kissed her, and hurried her into his room, and turned the</li>
<li class="L10967" rel="L10967">key; then, came hurrying back to the Doctor, and opened the window and</li>
<li class="L10968" rel="L10968">partly opened the blind, and put his hand upon the Doctor&#39;s arm, and</li>
<li class="L10969" rel="L10969">looked out with him into the courtyard.</li>
<li class="L10970" rel="L10970"></li>
<li class="L10971" rel="L10971">Looked out upon a throng of men and women: not enough in number, or near</li>
<li class="L10972" rel="L10972">enough, to fill the courtyard: not more than forty or fifty in all. The</li>
<li class="L10973" rel="L10973">people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate, and they</li>
<li class="L10974" rel="L10974">had rushed in to work at the grindstone; it had evidently been set up</li>
<li class="L10975" rel="L10975">there for their purpose, as in a convenient and retired spot.</li>
<li class="L10976" rel="L10976"></li>
<li class="L10977" rel="L10977">But, such awful workers, and such awful work!</li>
<li class="L10978" rel="L10978"></li>
<li class="L10979" rel="L10979">The grindstone had a double handle, and, turning at it madly were two</li>
<li class="L10980" rel="L10980">men, whose faces, as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of</li>
<li class="L10981" rel="L10981">the grindstone brought their faces up, were more horrible and cruel than</li>
<li class="L10982" rel="L10982">the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise.</li>
<li class="L10983" rel="L10983">False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them, and their</li>
<li class="L10984" rel="L10984">hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty, and all awry with</li>
<li class="L10985" rel="L10985">howling, and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of</li>
<li class="L10986" rel="L10986">sleep. As these ruffians turned and turned, their matted locks now flung</li>
<li class="L10987" rel="L10987">forward over their eyes, now flung backward over their necks, some women</li>
<li class="L10988" rel="L10988">held wine to their mouths that they might drink; and what with dropping</li>
<li class="L10989" rel="L10989">blood, and what with dropping wine, and what with the stream of sparks</li>
<li class="L10990" rel="L10990">struck out of the stone, all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and</li>
<li class="L10991" rel="L10991">fire. The eye could not detect one creature in the group free from</li>
<li class="L10992" rel="L10992">the smear of blood. Shouldering one another to get next at the</li>
<li class="L10993" rel="L10993">sharpening-stone, were men stripped to the waist, with the stain all</li>
<li class="L10994" rel="L10994">over their limbs and bodies; men in all sorts of rags, with the stain</li>
<li class="L10995" rel="L10995">upon those rags; men devilishly set off with spoils of women&#39;s lace</li>
<li class="L10996" rel="L10996">and silk and ribbon, with the stain dyeing those trifles through</li>
<li class="L10997" rel="L10997">and through. Hatchets, knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be</li>
<li class="L10998" rel="L10998">sharpened, were all red with it. Some of the hacked swords were tied to</li>
<li class="L10999" rel="L10999">the wrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments</li>
<li class="L11000" rel="L11000">of dress: ligatures various in kind, but all deep of the one colour. And</li>
<li class="L11001" rel="L11001">as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream</li>
<li class="L11002" rel="L11002">of sparks and tore away into the streets, the same red hue was red in</li>
<li class="L11003" rel="L11003">their frenzied eyes;--eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have</li>
<li class="L11004" rel="L11004">given twenty years of life, to petrify with a well-directed gun.</li>
<li class="L11005" rel="L11005"></li>
<li class="L11006" rel="L11006">All this was seen in a moment, as the vision of a drowning man, or of</li>
<li class="L11007" rel="L11007">any human creature at any very great pass, could see a world if it</li>
<li class="L11008" rel="L11008">were there. They drew back from the window, and the Doctor looked for</li>
<li class="L11009" rel="L11009">explanation in his friend&#39;s ashy face.</li>
<li class="L11010" rel="L11010"></li>
<li class="L11011" rel="L11011">“They are,” Mr. Lorry whispered the words, glancing fearfully round at</li>
<li class="L11012" rel="L11012">the locked room, “murdering the prisoners. If you are sure of what you</li>
<li class="L11013" rel="L11013">say; if you really have the power you think you have--as I believe you</li>
<li class="L11014" rel="L11014">have--make yourself known to these devils, and get taken to La Force. It</li>
<li class="L11015" rel="L11015">may be too late, I don&#39;t know, but let it not be a minute later!”</li>
<li class="L11016" rel="L11016"></li>
<li class="L11017" rel="L11017">Doctor Manette pressed his hand, hastened bareheaded out of the room,</li>
<li class="L11018" rel="L11018">and was in the courtyard when Mr. Lorry regained the blind.</li>
<li class="L11019" rel="L11019"></li>
<li class="L11020" rel="L11020">His streaming white hair, his remarkable face, and the impetuous</li>
<li class="L11021" rel="L11021">confidence of his manner, as he put the weapons aside like water,</li>
<li class="L11022" rel="L11022">carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone.</li>
<li class="L11023" rel="L11023">For a few moments there was a pause, and a hurry, and a murmur, and</li>
<li class="L11024" rel="L11024">the unintelligible sound of his voice; and then Mr. Lorry saw him,</li>
<li class="L11025" rel="L11025">surrounded by all, and in the midst of a line of twenty men long, all</li>
<li class="L11026" rel="L11026">linked shoulder to shoulder, and hand to shoulder, hurried out with</li>
<li class="L11027" rel="L11027">cries of--“Live the Bastille prisoner! Help for the Bastille prisoner&#39;s</li>
<li class="L11028" rel="L11028">kindred in La Force! Room for the Bastille prisoner in front there! Save</li>
<li class="L11029" rel="L11029">the prisoner Evremonde at La Force!” and a thousand answering shouts.</li>
<li class="L11030" rel="L11030"></li>
<li class="L11031" rel="L11031">He closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart, closed the window</li>
<li class="L11032" rel="L11032">and the curtain, hastened to Lucie, and told her that her father was</li>
<li class="L11033" rel="L11033">assisted by the people, and gone in search of her husband. He found</li>
<li class="L11034" rel="L11034">her child and Miss Pross with her; but, it never occurred to him to be</li>
<li class="L11035" rel="L11035">surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards, when he sat</li>
<li class="L11036" rel="L11036">watching them in such quiet as the night knew.</li>
<li class="L11037" rel="L11037"></li>
<li class="L11038" rel="L11038">Lucie had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet,</li>
<li class="L11039" rel="L11039">clinging to his hand. Miss Pross had laid the child down on his own</li>
<li class="L11040" rel="L11040">bed, and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty</li>
<li class="L11041" rel="L11041">charge. O the long, long night, with the moans of the poor wife! And O</li>
<li class="L11042" rel="L11042">the long, long night, with no return of her father and no tidings!</li>
<li class="L11043" rel="L11043"></li>
<li class="L11044" rel="L11044">Twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded, and the</li>
<li class="L11045" rel="L11045">irruption was repeated, and the grindstone whirled and spluttered.</li>
<li class="L11046" rel="L11046">“What is it?” cried Lucie, affrighted. “Hush! The soldiers&#39; swords are</li>
<li class="L11047" rel="L11047">sharpened there,” said Mr. Lorry. “The place is national property now,</li>
<li class="L11048" rel="L11048">and used as a kind of armoury, my love.”</li>
<li class="L11049" rel="L11049"></li>
<li class="L11050" rel="L11050">Twice more in all; but, the last spell of work was feeble and fitful.</li>
<li class="L11051" rel="L11051">Soon afterwards the day began to dawn, and he softly detached himself</li>
<li class="L11052" rel="L11052">from the clasping hand, and cautiously looked out again. A man, so</li>
<li class="L11053" rel="L11053">besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back</li>
<li class="L11054" rel="L11054">to consciousness on a field of slain, was rising from the pavement by</li>
<li class="L11055" rel="L11055">the side of the grindstone, and looking about him with a vacant air.</li>
<li class="L11056" rel="L11056">Shortly, this worn-out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of</li>
<li class="L11057" rel="L11057">the carriages of Monseigneur, and, staggering to that gorgeous vehicle,</li>
<li class="L11058" rel="L11058">climbed in at the door, and shut himself up to take his rest on its</li>
<li class="L11059" rel="L11059">dainty cushions.</li>
<li class="L11060" rel="L11060"></li>
<li class="L11061" rel="L11061">The great grindstone, Earth, had turned when Mr. Lorry looked out again,</li>
<li class="L11062" rel="L11062">and the sun was red on the courtyard. But, the lesser grindstone stood</li>
<li class="L11063" rel="L11063">alone there in the calm morning air, with a red upon it that the sun had</li>
<li class="L11064" rel="L11064">never given, and would never take away.</li>
<li class="L11065" rel="L11065"></li>
<li class="L11066" rel="L11066"></li>
<li class="L11067" rel="L11067"></li>
<li class="L11068" rel="L11068"></li>
<li class="L11069" rel="L11069">III. The Shadow</li>
<li class="L11070" rel="L11070"></li>
<li class="L11071" rel="L11071"></li>
<li class="L11072" rel="L11072">One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr.</li>
<li class="L11073" rel="L11073">Lorry when business hours came round, was this:--that he had no right to</li>
<li class="L11074" rel="L11074">imperil Tellson&#39;s by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under</li>
<li class="L11075" rel="L11075">the Bank roof. His own possessions, safety, life, he would have hazarded</li>
<li class="L11076" rel="L11076">for Lucie and her child, without a moment&#39;s demur; but the great trust</li>
<li class="L11077" rel="L11077">he held was not his own, and as to that business charge he was a strict</li>
<li class="L11078" rel="L11078">man of business.</li>
<li class="L11079" rel="L11079"></li>
<li class="L11080" rel="L11080">At first, his mind reverted to Defarge, and he thought of finding out</li>
<li class="L11081" rel="L11081">the wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to</li>
<li class="L11082" rel="L11082">the safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city. But, the</li>
<li class="L11083" rel="L11083">same consideration that suggested him, repudiated him; he lived in the</li>
<li class="L11084" rel="L11084">most violent Quarter, and doubtless was influential there, and deep in</li>
<li class="L11085" rel="L11085">its dangerous workings.</li>
<li class="L11086" rel="L11086"></li>
<li class="L11087" rel="L11087">Noon coming, and the Doctor not returning, and every minute&#39;s delay</li>
<li class="L11088" rel="L11088">tending to compromise Tellson&#39;s, Mr. Lorry advised with Lucie. She said</li>
<li class="L11089" rel="L11089">that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term, in that</li>
<li class="L11090" rel="L11090">Quarter, near the Banking-house. As there was no business objection to</li>
<li class="L11091" rel="L11091">this, and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with Charles, and</li>
<li class="L11092" rel="L11092">he were to be released, he could not hope to leave the city, Mr. Lorry</li>
<li class="L11093" rel="L11093">went out in quest of such a lodging, and found a suitable one, high up</li>
<li class="L11094" rel="L11094">in a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows</li>
<li class="L11095" rel="L11095">of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes.</li>
<li class="L11096" rel="L11096"></li>
<li class="L11097" rel="L11097">To this lodging he at once removed Lucie and her child, and Miss Pross:</li>
<li class="L11098" rel="L11098">giving them what comfort he could, and much more than he had himself.</li>
<li class="L11099" rel="L11099">He left Jerry with them, as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear</li>
<li class="L11100" rel="L11100">considerable knocking on the head, and returned to his own occupations.</li>
<li class="L11101" rel="L11101">A disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them, and slowly</li>
<li class="L11102" rel="L11102">and heavily the day lagged on with him.</li>
<li class="L11103" rel="L11103"></li>
<li class="L11104" rel="L11104">It wore itself out, and wore him out with it, until the Bank closed. He</li>
<li class="L11105" rel="L11105">was again alone in his room of the previous night, considering what to</li>
<li class="L11106" rel="L11106">do next, when he heard a foot upon the stair. In a few moments, a</li>
<li class="L11107" rel="L11107">man stood in his presence, who, with a keenly observant look at him,</li>
<li class="L11108" rel="L11108">addressed him by his name.</li>
<li class="L11109" rel="L11109"></li>
<li class="L11110" rel="L11110">“Your servant,” said Mr. Lorry. “Do you know me?”</li>
<li class="L11111" rel="L11111"></li>
<li class="L11112" rel="L11112">He was a strongly made man with dark curling hair, from forty-five</li>
<li class="L11113" rel="L11113">to fifty years of age. For answer he repeated, without any change of</li>
<li class="L11114" rel="L11114">emphasis, the words:</li>
<li class="L11115" rel="L11115"></li>
<li class="L11116" rel="L11116">“Do you know me?”</li>
<li class="L11117" rel="L11117"></li>
<li class="L11118" rel="L11118">“I have seen you somewhere.”</li>
<li class="L11119" rel="L11119"></li>
<li class="L11120" rel="L11120">“Perhaps at my wine-shop?”</li>
<li class="L11121" rel="L11121"></li>
<li class="L11122" rel="L11122">Much interested and agitated, Mr. Lorry said: “You come from Doctor</li>
<li class="L11123" rel="L11123">Manette?”</li>
<li class="L11124" rel="L11124"></li>
<li class="L11125" rel="L11125">“Yes. I come from Doctor Manette.”</li>
<li class="L11126" rel="L11126"></li>
<li class="L11127" rel="L11127">“And what says he? What does he send me?”</li>
<li class="L11128" rel="L11128"></li>
<li class="L11129" rel="L11129">Defarge gave into his anxious hand, an open scrap of paper. It bore the</li>
<li class="L11130" rel="L11130">words in the Doctor&#39;s writing:</li>
<li class="L11131" rel="L11131"></li>
<li class="L11132" rel="L11132">    “Charles is safe, but I cannot safely leave this place yet.</li>
<li class="L11133" rel="L11133">     I have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note</li>
<li class="L11134" rel="L11134">     from Charles to his wife.  Let the bearer see his wife.”</li>
<li class="L11135" rel="L11135"></li>
<li class="L11136" rel="L11136">It was dated from La Force, within an hour.</li>
<li class="L11137" rel="L11137"></li>
<li class="L11138" rel="L11138">“Will you accompany me,” said Mr. Lorry, joyfully relieved after reading</li>
<li class="L11139" rel="L11139">this note aloud, “to where his wife resides?”</li>
<li class="L11140" rel="L11140"></li>
<li class="L11141" rel="L11141">“Yes,” returned Defarge.</li>
<li class="L11142" rel="L11142"></li>
<li class="L11143" rel="L11143">Scarcely noticing as yet, in what a curiously reserved and mechanical</li>
<li class="L11144" rel="L11144">way Defarge spoke, Mr. Lorry put on his hat and they went down into the</li>
<li class="L11145" rel="L11145">courtyard. There, they found two women; one, knitting.</li>
<li class="L11146" rel="L11146"></li>
<li class="L11147" rel="L11147">“Madame Defarge, surely!” said Mr. Lorry, who had left her in exactly</li>
<li class="L11148" rel="L11148">the same attitude some seventeen years ago.</li>
<li class="L11149" rel="L11149"></li>
<li class="L11150" rel="L11150">“It is she,” observed her husband.</li>
<li class="L11151" rel="L11151"></li>
<li class="L11152" rel="L11152">“Does Madame go with us?” inquired Mr. Lorry, seeing that she moved as</li>
<li class="L11153" rel="L11153">they moved.</li>
<li class="L11154" rel="L11154"></li>
<li class="L11155" rel="L11155">“Yes. That she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons.</li>
<li class="L11156" rel="L11156">It is for their safety.”</li>
<li class="L11157" rel="L11157"></li>
<li class="L11158" rel="L11158">Beginning to be struck by Defarge&#39;s manner, Mr. Lorry looked dubiously</li>
<li class="L11159" rel="L11159">at him, and led the way. Both the women followed; the second woman being</li>
<li class="L11160" rel="L11160">The Vengeance.</li>
<li class="L11161" rel="L11161"></li>
<li class="L11162" rel="L11162">They passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might,</li>
<li class="L11163" rel="L11163">ascended the staircase of the new domicile, were admitted by Jerry,</li>
<li class="L11164" rel="L11164">and found Lucie weeping, alone. She was thrown into a transport by the</li>
<li class="L11165" rel="L11165">tidings Mr. Lorry gave her of her husband, and clasped the hand that</li>
<li class="L11166" rel="L11166">delivered his note--little thinking what it had been doing near him in</li>
<li class="L11167" rel="L11167">the night, and might, but for a chance, have done to him.</li>
<li class="L11168" rel="L11168"></li>
<li class="L11169" rel="L11169">     “DEAREST,--Take courage.  I am well, and your father has</li>
<li class="L11170" rel="L11170">      influence around me.  You cannot answer this.</li>
<li class="L11171" rel="L11171">      Kiss our child for me.”</li>
<li class="L11172" rel="L11172"></li>
<li class="L11173" rel="L11173">That was all the writing. It was so much, however, to her who received</li>
<li class="L11174" rel="L11174">it, that she turned from Defarge to his wife, and kissed one of the</li>
<li class="L11175" rel="L11175">hands that knitted. It was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly</li>
<li class="L11176" rel="L11176">action, but the hand made no response--dropped cold and heavy, and took</li>
<li class="L11177" rel="L11177">to its knitting again.</li>
<li class="L11178" rel="L11178"></li>
<li class="L11179" rel="L11179">There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check. She stopped in</li>
<li class="L11180" rel="L11180">the act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands yet at her</li>
<li class="L11181" rel="L11181">neck, looked terrified at Madame Defarge. Madame Defarge met the lifted</li>
<li class="L11182" rel="L11182">eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare.</li>
<li class="L11183" rel="L11183"></li>
<li class="L11184" rel="L11184">“My dear,” said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; “there are frequent</li>
<li class="L11185" rel="L11185">risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever</li>
<li class="L11186" rel="L11186">trouble you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power</li>
<li class="L11187" rel="L11187">to protect at such times, to the end that she may know them--that she</li>
<li class="L11188" rel="L11188">may identify them. I believe,” said Mr. Lorry, rather halting in his</li>
<li class="L11189" rel="L11189">reassuring words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself</li>
<li class="L11190" rel="L11190">upon him more and more, “I state the case, Citizen Defarge?”</li>
<li class="L11191" rel="L11191"></li>
<li class="L11192" rel="L11192">Defarge looked gloomily at his wife, and gave no other answer than a</li>
<li class="L11193" rel="L11193">gruff sound of acquiescence.</li>
<li class="L11194" rel="L11194"></li>
<li class="L11195" rel="L11195">“You had better, Lucie,” said Mr. Lorry, doing all he could to</li>
<li class="L11196" rel="L11196">propitiate, by tone and manner, “have the dear child here, and our</li>
<li class="L11197" rel="L11197">good Pross. Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no</li>
<li class="L11198" rel="L11198">French.”</li>
<li class="L11199" rel="L11199"></li>
<li class="L11200" rel="L11200">The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more than a</li>
<li class="L11201" rel="L11201">match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and, danger,</li>
<li class="L11202" rel="L11202">appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The Vengeance,</li>
<li class="L11203" rel="L11203">whom her eyes first encountered, “Well, I am sure, Boldface! I hope</li>
<li class="L11204" rel="L11204">_you_ are pretty well!” She also bestowed a British cough on Madame</li>
<li class="L11205" rel="L11205">Defarge; but, neither of the two took much heed of her.</li>
<li class="L11206" rel="L11206"></li>
<li class="L11207" rel="L11207">“Is that his child?” said Madame Defarge, stopping in her work for the</li>
<li class="L11208" rel="L11208">first time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it</li>
<li class="L11209" rel="L11209">were the finger of Fate.</li>
<li class="L11210" rel="L11210"></li>
<li class="L11211" rel="L11211">“Yes, madame,” answered Mr. Lorry; “this is our poor prisoner&#39;s darling</li>
<li class="L11212" rel="L11212">daughter, and only child.”</li>
<li class="L11213" rel="L11213"></li>
<li class="L11214" rel="L11214">The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to fall so</li>
<li class="L11215" rel="L11215">threatening and dark on the child, that her mother instinctively</li>
<li class="L11216" rel="L11216">kneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast. The</li>
<li class="L11217" rel="L11217">shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall,</li>
<li class="L11218" rel="L11218">threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child.</li>
<li class="L11219" rel="L11219"></li>
<li class="L11220" rel="L11220">“It is enough, my husband,” said Madame Defarge. “I have seen them. We</li>
<li class="L11221" rel="L11221">may go.”</li>
<li class="L11222" rel="L11222"></li>
<li class="L11223" rel="L11223">But, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it--not visible and</li>
<li class="L11224" rel="L11224">presented, but indistinct and withheld--to alarm Lucie into saying, as</li>
<li class="L11225" rel="L11225">she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge&#39;s dress:</li>
<li class="L11226" rel="L11226"></li>
<li class="L11227" rel="L11227">“You will be good to my poor husband. You will do him no harm. You will</li>
<li class="L11228" rel="L11228">help me to see him if you can?”</li>
<li class="L11229" rel="L11229"></li>
<li class="L11230" rel="L11230">“Your husband is not my business here,” returned Madame Defarge, looking</li>
<li class="L11231" rel="L11231">down at her with perfect composure. “It is the daughter of your father</li>
<li class="L11232" rel="L11232">who is my business here.”</li>
<li class="L11233" rel="L11233"></li>
<li class="L11234" rel="L11234">“For my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my child&#39;s sake! She</li>
<li class="L11235" rel="L11235">will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful. We are more</li>
<li class="L11236" rel="L11236">afraid of you than of these others.”</li>
<li class="L11237" rel="L11237"></li>
<li class="L11238" rel="L11238">Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband.</li>
<li class="L11239" rel="L11239">Defarge, who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and looking at her,</li>
<li class="L11240" rel="L11240">collected his face into a sterner expression.</li>
<li class="L11241" rel="L11241"></li>
<li class="L11242" rel="L11242">“What is it that your husband says in that little letter?” asked Madame</li>
<li class="L11243" rel="L11243">Defarge, with a lowering smile. “Influence; he says something touching</li>
<li class="L11244" rel="L11244">influence?”</li>
<li class="L11245" rel="L11245"></li>
<li class="L11246" rel="L11246">“That my father,” said Lucie, hurriedly taking the paper from her</li>
<li class="L11247" rel="L11247">breast, but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it, “has</li>
<li class="L11248" rel="L11248">much influence around him.”</li>
<li class="L11249" rel="L11249"></li>
<li class="L11250" rel="L11250">“Surely it will release him!” said Madame Defarge. “Let it do so.”</li>
<li class="L11251" rel="L11251"></li>
<li class="L11252" rel="L11252">“As a wife and mother,” cried Lucie, most earnestly, “I implore you to</li>
<li class="L11253" rel="L11253">have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess, against</li>
<li class="L11254" rel="L11254">my innocent husband, but to use it in his behalf. O sister-woman, think</li>
<li class="L11255" rel="L11255">of me. As a wife and mother!”</li>
<li class="L11256" rel="L11256"></li>
<li class="L11257" rel="L11257">Madame Defarge looked, coldly as ever, at the suppliant, and said,</li>
<li class="L11258" rel="L11258">turning to her friend The Vengeance:</li>
<li class="L11259" rel="L11259"></li>
<li class="L11260" rel="L11260">“The wives and mothers we have been used to see, since we were as little</li>
<li class="L11261" rel="L11261">as this child, and much less, have not been greatly considered? We have</li>
<li class="L11262" rel="L11262">known _their_ husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them,</li>
<li class="L11263" rel="L11263">often enough? All our lives, we have seen our sister-women suffer, in</li>
<li class="L11264" rel="L11264">themselves and in their children, poverty, nakedness, hunger, thirst,</li>
<li class="L11265" rel="L11265">sickness, misery, oppression and neglect of all kinds?”</li>
<li class="L11266" rel="L11266"></li>
<li class="L11267" rel="L11267">“We have seen nothing else,” returned The Vengeance.</li>
<li class="L11268" rel="L11268"></li>
<li class="L11269" rel="L11269">“We have borne this a long time,” said Madame Defarge, turning her eyes</li>
<li class="L11270" rel="L11270">again upon Lucie. “Judge you! Is it likely that the trouble of one wife</li>
<li class="L11271" rel="L11271">and mother would be much to us now?”</li>
<li class="L11272" rel="L11272"></li>
<li class="L11273" rel="L11273">She resumed her knitting and went out. The Vengeance followed. Defarge</li>
<li class="L11274" rel="L11274">went last, and closed the door.</li>
<li class="L11275" rel="L11275"></li>
<li class="L11276" rel="L11276">“Courage, my dear Lucie,” said Mr. Lorry, as he raised her. “Courage,</li>
<li class="L11277" rel="L11277">courage! So far all goes well with us--much, much better than it has of</li>
<li class="L11278" rel="L11278">late gone with many poor souls. Cheer up, and have a thankful heart.”</li>
<li class="L11279" rel="L11279"></li>
<li class="L11280" rel="L11280">“I am not thankless, I hope, but that dreadful woman seems to throw a</li>
<li class="L11281" rel="L11281">shadow on me and on all my hopes.”</li>
<li class="L11282" rel="L11282"></li>
<li class="L11283" rel="L11283">“Tut, tut!” said Mr. Lorry; “what is this despondency in the brave</li>
<li class="L11284" rel="L11284">little breast? A shadow indeed! No substance in it, Lucie.”</li>
<li class="L11285" rel="L11285"></li>
<li class="L11286" rel="L11286">But the shadow of the manner of these Defarges was dark upon himself,</li>
<li class="L11287" rel="L11287">for all that, and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly.</li>
<li class="L11288" rel="L11288"></li>
<li class="L11289" rel="L11289"></li>
<li class="L11290" rel="L11290"></li>
<li class="L11291" rel="L11291"></li>
<li class="L11292" rel="L11292">IV. Calm in Storm</li>
<li class="L11293" rel="L11293"></li>
<li class="L11294" rel="L11294"></li>
<li class="L11295" rel="L11295">Doctor Manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his</li>
<li class="L11296" rel="L11296">absence. So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be</li>
<li class="L11297" rel="L11297">kept from the knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from her, that</li>
<li class="L11298" rel="L11298">not until long afterwards, when France and she were far apart, did she</li>
<li class="L11299" rel="L11299">know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all</li>
<li class="L11300" rel="L11300">ages had been killed by the populace; that four days and nights had been</li>
<li class="L11301" rel="L11301">darkened by this deed of horror; and that the air around her had been</li>
<li class="L11302" rel="L11302">tainted by the slain. She only knew that there had been an attack upon</li>
<li class="L11303" rel="L11303">the prisons, that all political prisoners had been in danger, and that</li>
<li class="L11304" rel="L11304">some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered.</li>
<li class="L11305" rel="L11305"></li>
<li class="L11306" rel="L11306">To Mr. Lorry, the Doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on</li>
<li class="L11307" rel="L11307">which he had no need to dwell, that the crowd had taken him through a</li>
<li class="L11308" rel="L11308">scene of carnage to the prison of La Force. That, in the prison he had</li>
<li class="L11309" rel="L11309">found a self-appointed Tribunal sitting, before which the prisoners were</li>
<li class="L11310" rel="L11310">brought singly, and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth</li>
<li class="L11311" rel="L11311">to be massacred, or to be released, or (in a few cases) to be sent back</li>
<li class="L11312" rel="L11312">to their cells. That, presented by his conductors to this Tribunal, he</li>
<li class="L11313" rel="L11313">had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen</li>
<li class="L11314" rel="L11314">years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the Bastille; that, one of the</li>
<li class="L11315" rel="L11315">body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him, and that this</li>
<li class="L11316" rel="L11316">man was Defarge.</li>
<li class="L11317" rel="L11317"></li>
<li class="L11318" rel="L11318">That, hereupon he had ascertained, through the registers on the table,</li>
<li class="L11319" rel="L11319">that his son-in-law was among the living prisoners, and had pleaded hard</li>
<li class="L11320" rel="L11320">to the Tribunal--of whom some members were asleep and some awake, some</li>
<li class="L11321" rel="L11321">dirty with murder and some clean, some sober and some not--for his life</li>
<li class="L11322" rel="L11322">and liberty. That, in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as</li>
<li class="L11323" rel="L11323">a notable sufferer under the overthrown system, it had been accorded</li>
<li class="L11324" rel="L11324">to him to have Charles Darnay brought before the lawless Court, and</li>
<li class="L11325" rel="L11325">examined. That, he seemed on the point of being at once released, when</li>
<li class="L11326" rel="L11326">the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check (not intelligible</li>
<li class="L11327" rel="L11327">to the Doctor), which led to a few words of secret conference. That,</li>
<li class="L11328" rel="L11328">the man sitting as President had then informed Doctor Manette that</li>
<li class="L11329" rel="L11329">the prisoner must remain in custody, but should, for his sake, be held</li>
<li class="L11330" rel="L11330">inviolate in safe custody. That, immediately, on a signal, the prisoner</li>
<li class="L11331" rel="L11331">was removed to the interior of the prison again; but, that he, the</li>
<li class="L11332" rel="L11332">Doctor, had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and</li>
<li class="L11333" rel="L11333">assure himself that his son-in-law was, through no malice or mischance,</li>
<li class="L11334" rel="L11334">delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had</li>
<li class="L11335" rel="L11335">often drowned the proceedings, that he had obtained the permission, and</li>
<li class="L11336" rel="L11336">had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger was over.</li>
<li class="L11337" rel="L11337"></li>
<li class="L11338" rel="L11338">The sights he had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by</li>
<li class="L11339" rel="L11339">intervals, shall remain untold. The mad joy over the prisoners who were</li>
<li class="L11340" rel="L11340">saved, had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against</li>
<li class="L11341" rel="L11341">those who were cut to pieces. One prisoner there was, he said, who had</li>
<li class="L11342" rel="L11342">been discharged into the street free, but at whom a mistaken savage had</li>
<li class="L11343" rel="L11343">thrust a pike as he passed out. Being besought to go to him and dress</li>
<li class="L11344" rel="L11344">the wound, the Doctor had passed out at the same gate, and had found him</li>
<li class="L11345" rel="L11345">in the arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated on the bodies</li>
<li class="L11346" rel="L11346">of their victims. With an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this</li>
<li class="L11347" rel="L11347">awful nightmare, they had helped the healer, and tended the wounded man</li>
<li class="L11348" rel="L11348">with the gentlest solicitude--had made a litter for him and escorted him</li>
<li class="L11349" rel="L11349">carefully from the spot--had then caught up their weapons and plunged</li>
<li class="L11350" rel="L11350">anew into a butchery so dreadful, that the Doctor had covered his eyes</li>
<li class="L11351" rel="L11351">with his hands, and swooned away in the midst of it.</li>
<li class="L11352" rel="L11352"></li>
<li class="L11353" rel="L11353">As Mr. Lorry received these confidences, and as he watched the face of</li>
<li class="L11354" rel="L11354">his friend now sixty-two years of age, a misgiving arose within him that</li>
<li class="L11355" rel="L11355">such dread experiences would revive the old danger.</li>
<li class="L11356" rel="L11356"></li>
<li class="L11357" rel="L11357">But, he had never seen his friend in his present aspect: he had never</li>
<li class="L11358" rel="L11358">at all known him in his present character. For the first time the Doctor</li>
<li class="L11359" rel="L11359">felt, now, that his suffering was strength and power. For the first time</li>
<li class="L11360" rel="L11360">he felt that in that sharp fire, he had slowly forged the iron which</li>
<li class="L11361" rel="L11361">could break the prison door of his daughter&#39;s husband, and deliver him.</li>
<li class="L11362" rel="L11362">“It all tended to a good end, my friend; it was not mere waste and ruin.</li>
<li class="L11363" rel="L11363">As my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, I will be</li>
<li class="L11364" rel="L11364">helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her; by the aid</li>
<li class="L11365" rel="L11365">of Heaven I will do it!” Thus, Doctor Manette. And when Jarvis Lorry saw</li>
<li class="L11366" rel="L11366">the kindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look and bearing</li>
<li class="L11367" rel="L11367">of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a</li>
<li class="L11368" rel="L11368">clock, for so many years, and then set going again with an energy which</li>
<li class="L11369" rel="L11369">had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he believed.</li>
<li class="L11370" rel="L11370"></li>
<li class="L11371" rel="L11371">Greater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with, would</li>
<li class="L11372" rel="L11372">have yielded before his persevering purpose. While he kept himself</li>
<li class="L11373" rel="L11373">in his place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees</li>
<li class="L11374" rel="L11374">of mankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he used his</li>
<li class="L11375" rel="L11375">personal influence so wisely, that he was soon the inspecting physician</li>
<li class="L11376" rel="L11376">of three prisons, and among them of La Force. He could now assure Lucie</li>
<li class="L11377" rel="L11377">that her husband was no longer confined alone, but was mixed with the</li>
<li class="L11378" rel="L11378">general body of prisoners; he saw her husband weekly, and brought sweet</li>
<li class="L11379" rel="L11379">messages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes her husband himself</li>
<li class="L11380" rel="L11380">sent a letter to her (though never by the Doctor&#39;s hand), but she was</li>
<li class="L11381" rel="L11381">not permitted to write to him: for, among the many wild suspicions of</li>
<li class="L11382" rel="L11382">plots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were</li>
<li class="L11383" rel="L11383">known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad.</li>
<li class="L11384" rel="L11384"></li>
<li class="L11385" rel="L11385">This new life of the Doctor&#39;s was an anxious life, no doubt; still, the</li>
<li class="L11386" rel="L11386">sagacious Mr. Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it.</li>
<li class="L11387" rel="L11387">Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one;</li>
<li class="L11388" rel="L11388">but he observed it as a curiosity. The Doctor knew, that up to that</li>
<li class="L11389" rel="L11389">time, his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter</li>
<li class="L11390" rel="L11390">and his friend, with his personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness.</li>
<li class="L11391" rel="L11391">Now that this was changed, and he knew himself to be invested through</li>
<li class="L11392" rel="L11392">that old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charles&#39;s</li>
<li class="L11393" rel="L11393">ultimate safety and deliverance, he became so far exalted by the change,</li>
<li class="L11394" rel="L11394">that he took the lead and direction, and required them as the weak, to</li>
<li class="L11395" rel="L11395">trust to him as the strong. The preceding relative positions of himself</li>
<li class="L11396" rel="L11396">and Lucie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and</li>
<li class="L11397" rel="L11397">affection could reverse them, for he could have had no pride but in</li>
<li class="L11398" rel="L11398">rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him. “All</li>
<li class="L11399" rel="L11399">curious to see,” thought Mr. Lorry, in his amiably shrewd way, “but all</li>
<li class="L11400" rel="L11400">natural and right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it</li>
<li class="L11401" rel="L11401">couldn&#39;t be in better hands.”</li>
<li class="L11402" rel="L11402"></li>
<li class="L11403" rel="L11403">But, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get</li>
<li class="L11404" rel="L11404">Charles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to trial,</li>
<li class="L11405" rel="L11405">the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him. The new</li>
<li class="L11406" rel="L11406">era began; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of</li>
<li class="L11407" rel="L11407">Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for victory or death</li>
<li class="L11408" rel="L11408">against the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the</li>
<li class="L11409" rel="L11409">great towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise</li>
<li class="L11410" rel="L11410">against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils</li>
<li class="L11411" rel="L11411">of France, as if the dragon&#39;s teeth had been sown broadcast, and</li>
<li class="L11412" rel="L11412">had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and</li>
<li class="L11413" rel="L11413">alluvial mud, under the bright sky of the South and under the clouds of</li>
<li class="L11414" rel="L11414">the North, in fell and forest, in the vineyards and the olive-grounds</li>
<li class="L11415" rel="L11415">and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn, along the</li>
<li class="L11416" rel="L11416">fruitful banks of the broad rivers, and in the sand of the sea-shore.</li>
<li class="L11417" rel="L11417">What private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of the Year</li>
<li class="L11418" rel="L11418">One of Liberty--the deluge rising from below, not falling from above,</li>
<li class="L11419" rel="L11419">and with the windows of Heaven shut, not opened!</li>
<li class="L11420" rel="L11420"></li>
<li class="L11421" rel="L11421">There was no pause, no pity, no peace, no interval of relenting rest, no</li>
<li class="L11422" rel="L11422">measurement of time. Though days and nights circled as regularly as when</li>
<li class="L11423" rel="L11423">time was young, and the evening and morning were the first day, other</li>
<li class="L11424" rel="L11424">count of time there was none. Hold of it was lost in the raging fever</li>
<li class="L11425" rel="L11425">of a nation, as it is in the fever of one patient. Now, breaking the</li>
<li class="L11426" rel="L11426">unnatural silence of a whole city, the executioner showed the people the</li>
<li class="L11427" rel="L11427">head of the king--and now, it seemed almost in the same breath, the</li>
<li class="L11428" rel="L11428">head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned</li>
<li class="L11429" rel="L11429">widowhood and misery, to turn it grey.</li>
<li class="L11430" rel="L11430"></li>
<li class="L11431" rel="L11431">And yet, observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in</li>
<li class="L11432" rel="L11432">all such cases, the time was long, while it flamed by so fast. A</li>
<li class="L11433" rel="L11433">revolutionary tribunal in the capital, and forty or fifty thousand</li>
<li class="L11434" rel="L11434">revolutionary committees all over the land; a law of the Suspected,</li>
<li class="L11435" rel="L11435">which struck away all security for liberty or life, and delivered over</li>
<li class="L11436" rel="L11436">any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged</li>
<li class="L11437" rel="L11437">with people who had committed no offence, and could obtain no hearing;</li>
<li class="L11438" rel="L11438">these things became the established order and nature of appointed</li>
<li class="L11439" rel="L11439">things, and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old.</li>
<li class="L11440" rel="L11440">Above all, one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before</li>
<li class="L11441" rel="L11441">the general gaze from the foundations of the world--the figure of the</li>
<li class="L11442" rel="L11442">sharp female called La Guillotine.</li>
<li class="L11443" rel="L11443"></li>
<li class="L11444" rel="L11444">It was the popular theme for jests; it was the best cure for headache,</li>
<li class="L11445" rel="L11445">it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey, it imparted a</li>
<li class="L11446" rel="L11446">peculiar delicacy to the complexion, it was the National Razor which</li>
<li class="L11447" rel="L11447">shaved close: who kissed La Guillotine, looked through the little window</li>
<li class="L11448" rel="L11448">and sneezed into the sack. It was the sign of the regeneration of the</li>
<li class="L11449" rel="L11449">human race. It superseded the Cross. Models of it were worn on breasts</li>
<li class="L11450" rel="L11450">from which the Cross was discarded, and it was bowed down to and</li>
<li class="L11451" rel="L11451">believed in where the Cross was denied.</li>
<li class="L11452" rel="L11452"></li>
<li class="L11453" rel="L11453">It sheared off heads so many, that it, and the ground it most polluted,</li>
<li class="L11454" rel="L11454">were a rotten red. It was taken to pieces, like a toy-puzzle for a young</li>
<li class="L11455" rel="L11455">Devil, and was put together again when the occasion wanted it. It hushed</li>
<li class="L11456" rel="L11456">the eloquent, struck down the powerful, abolished the beautiful and</li>
<li class="L11457" rel="L11457">good. Twenty-two friends of high public mark, twenty-one living and one</li>
<li class="L11458" rel="L11458">dead, it had lopped the heads off, in one morning, in as many minutes.</li>
<li class="L11459" rel="L11459">The name of the strong man of Old Scripture had descended to the chief</li>
<li class="L11460" rel="L11460">functionary who worked it; but, so armed, he was stronger than his</li>
<li class="L11461" rel="L11461">namesake, and blinder, and tore away the gates of God&#39;s own Temple every</li>
<li class="L11462" rel="L11462">day.</li>
<li class="L11463" rel="L11463"></li>
<li class="L11464" rel="L11464">Among these terrors, and the brood belonging to them, the Doctor walked</li>
<li class="L11465" rel="L11465">with a steady head: confident in his power, cautiously persistent in his</li>
<li class="L11466" rel="L11466">end, never doubting that he would save Lucie&#39;s husband at last. Yet the</li>
<li class="L11467" rel="L11467">current of the time swept by, so strong and deep, and carried the time</li>
<li class="L11468" rel="L11468">away so fiercely, that Charles had lain in prison one year and three</li>
<li class="L11469" rel="L11469">months when the Doctor was thus steady and confident. So much more</li>
<li class="L11470" rel="L11470">wicked and distracted had the Revolution grown in that December month,</li>
<li class="L11471" rel="L11471">that the rivers of the South were encumbered with the bodies of the</li>
<li class="L11472" rel="L11472">violently drowned by night, and prisoners were shot in lines and squares</li>
<li class="L11473" rel="L11473">under the southern wintry sun. Still, the Doctor walked among the</li>
<li class="L11474" rel="L11474">terrors with a steady head. No man better known than he, in Paris at</li>
<li class="L11475" rel="L11475">that day; no man in a stranger situation. Silent, humane, indispensable</li>
<li class="L11476" rel="L11476">in hospital and prison, using his art equally among assassins and</li>
<li class="L11477" rel="L11477">victims, he was a man apart. In the exercise of his skill, the</li>
<li class="L11478" rel="L11478">appearance and the story of the Bastille Captive removed him from all</li>
<li class="L11479" rel="L11479">other men. He was not suspected or brought in question, any more than if</li>
<li class="L11480" rel="L11480">he had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before, or were</li>
<li class="L11481" rel="L11481">a Spirit moving among mortals.</li>
<li class="L11482" rel="L11482"></li>
<li class="L11483" rel="L11483"></li>
<li class="L11484" rel="L11484"></li>
<li class="L11485" rel="L11485"></li>
<li class="L11486" rel="L11486">V. The Wood-Sawyer</li>
<li class="L11487" rel="L11487"></li>
<li class="L11488" rel="L11488"></li>
<li class="L11489" rel="L11489">One year and three months. During all that time Lucie was never</li>
<li class="L11490" rel="L11490">sure, from hour to hour, but that the Guillotine would strike off her</li>
<li class="L11491" rel="L11491">husband&#39;s head next day. Every day, through the stony streets, the</li>
<li class="L11492" rel="L11492">tumbrils now jolted heavily, filled with Condemned. Lovely girls; bright</li>
<li class="L11493" rel="L11493">women, brown-haired, black-haired, and grey; youths; stalwart men and</li>
<li class="L11494" rel="L11494">old; gentle born and peasant born; all red wine for La Guillotine, all</li>
<li class="L11495" rel="L11495">daily brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons,</li>
<li class="L11496" rel="L11496">and carried to her through the streets to slake her devouring thirst.</li>
<li class="L11497" rel="L11497">Liberty, equality, fraternity, or death;--the last, much the easiest to</li>
<li class="L11498" rel="L11498">bestow, O Guillotine!</li>
<li class="L11499" rel="L11499"></li>
<li class="L11500" rel="L11500">If the suddenness of her calamity, and the whirling wheels of the time,</li>
<li class="L11501" rel="L11501">had stunned the Doctor&#39;s daughter into awaiting the result in idle</li>
<li class="L11502" rel="L11502">despair, it would but have been with her as it was with many. But, from</li>
<li class="L11503" rel="L11503">the hour when she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom in</li>
<li class="L11504" rel="L11504">the garret of Saint Antoine, she had been true to her duties. She was</li>
<li class="L11505" rel="L11505">truest to them in the season of trial, as all the quietly loyal and good</li>
<li class="L11506" rel="L11506">will always be.</li>
<li class="L11507" rel="L11507"></li>
<li class="L11508" rel="L11508">As soon as they were established in their new residence, and her father</li>
<li class="L11509" rel="L11509">had entered on the routine of his avocations, she arranged the little</li>
<li class="L11510" rel="L11510">household as exactly as if her husband had been there. Everything had</li>
<li class="L11511" rel="L11511">its appointed place and its appointed time. Little Lucie she taught,</li>
<li class="L11512" rel="L11512">as regularly, as if they had all been united in their English home. The</li>
<li class="L11513" rel="L11513">slight devices with which she cheated herself into the show of a belief</li>
<li class="L11514" rel="L11514">that they would soon be reunited--the little preparations for his speedy</li>
<li class="L11515" rel="L11515">return, the setting aside of his chair and his books--these, and the</li>
<li class="L11516" rel="L11516">solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially, among the many</li>
<li class="L11517" rel="L11517">unhappy souls in prison and the shadow of death--were almost the only</li>
<li class="L11518" rel="L11518">outspoken reliefs of her heavy mind.</li>
<li class="L11519" rel="L11519"></li>
<li class="L11520" rel="L11520">She did not greatly alter in appearance. The plain dark dresses, akin to</li>
<li class="L11521" rel="L11521">mourning dresses, which she and her child wore, were as neat and as well</li>
<li class="L11522" rel="L11522">attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days. She lost her colour,</li>
<li class="L11523" rel="L11523">and the old and intent expression was a constant, not an occasional,</li>
<li class="L11524" rel="L11524">thing; otherwise, she remained very pretty and comely. Sometimes, at</li>
<li class="L11525" rel="L11525">night on kissing her father, she would burst into the grief she had</li>
<li class="L11526" rel="L11526">repressed all day, and would say that her sole reliance, under Heaven,</li>
<li class="L11527" rel="L11527">was on him. He always resolutely answered: “Nothing can happen to him</li>
<li class="L11528" rel="L11528">without my knowledge, and I know that I can save him, Lucie.”</li>
<li class="L11529" rel="L11529"></li>
<li class="L11530" rel="L11530">They had not made the round of their changed life many weeks, when her</li>
<li class="L11531" rel="L11531">father said to her, on coming home one evening:</li>
<li class="L11532" rel="L11532"></li>
<li class="L11533" rel="L11533">“My dear, there is an upper window in the prison, to which Charles can</li>
<li class="L11534" rel="L11534">sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon. When he can get to</li>
<li class="L11535" rel="L11535">it--which depends on many uncertainties and incidents--he might see you</li>
<li class="L11536" rel="L11536">in the street, he thinks, if you stood in a certain place that I can</li>
<li class="L11537" rel="L11537">show you. But you will not be able to see him, my poor child, and even</li>
<li class="L11538" rel="L11538">if you could, it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition.”</li>
<li class="L11539" rel="L11539"></li>
<li class="L11540" rel="L11540">“O show me the place, my father, and I will go there every day.”</li>
<li class="L11541" rel="L11541"></li>
<li class="L11542" rel="L11542">From that time, in all weathers, she waited there two hours. As the</li>
<li class="L11543" rel="L11543">clock struck two, she was there, and at four she turned resignedly away.</li>
<li class="L11544" rel="L11544">When it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her, they</li>
<li class="L11545" rel="L11545">went together; at other times she was alone; but, she never missed a</li>
<li class="L11546" rel="L11546">single day.</li>
<li class="L11547" rel="L11547"></li>
<li class="L11548" rel="L11548">It was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street. The hovel</li>
<li class="L11549" rel="L11549">of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning, was the only house at that</li>
<li class="L11550" rel="L11550">end; all else was wall. On the third day of her being there, he noticed</li>
<li class="L11551" rel="L11551">her.</li>
<li class="L11552" rel="L11552"></li>
<li class="L11553" rel="L11553">“Good day, citizeness.”</li>
<li class="L11554" rel="L11554"></li>
<li class="L11555" rel="L11555">“Good day, citizen.”</li>
<li class="L11556" rel="L11556"></li>
<li class="L11557" rel="L11557">This mode of address was now prescribed by decree. It had been</li>
<li class="L11558" rel="L11558">established voluntarily some time ago, among the more thorough patriots;</li>
<li class="L11559" rel="L11559">but, was now law for everybody.</li>
<li class="L11560" rel="L11560"></li>
<li class="L11561" rel="L11561">“Walking here again, citizeness?”</li>
<li class="L11562" rel="L11562"></li>
<li class="L11563" rel="L11563">“You see me, citizen!”</li>
<li class="L11564" rel="L11564"></li>
<li class="L11565" rel="L11565">The wood-sawyer, who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture (he</li>
<li class="L11566" rel="L11566">had once been a mender of roads), cast a glance at the prison, pointed</li>
<li class="L11567" rel="L11567">at the prison, and putting his ten fingers before his face to represent</li>
<li class="L11568" rel="L11568">bars, peeped through them jocosely.</li>
<li class="L11569" rel="L11569"></li>
<li class="L11570" rel="L11570">“But it&#39;s not my business,” said he. And went on sawing his wood.</li>
<li class="L11571" rel="L11571"></li>
<li class="L11572" rel="L11572">Next day he was looking out for her, and accosted her the moment she</li>
<li class="L11573" rel="L11573">appeared.</li>
<li class="L11574" rel="L11574"></li>
<li class="L11575" rel="L11575">“What? Walking here again, citizeness?”</li>
<li class="L11576" rel="L11576"></li>
<li class="L11577" rel="L11577">“Yes, citizen.”</li>
<li class="L11578" rel="L11578"></li>
<li class="L11579" rel="L11579">“Ah! A child too! Your mother, is it not, my little citizeness?”</li>
<li class="L11580" rel="L11580"></li>
<li class="L11581" rel="L11581">“Do I say yes, mamma?” whispered little Lucie, drawing close to her.</li>
<li class="L11582" rel="L11582"></li>
<li class="L11583" rel="L11583">“Yes, dearest.”</li>
<li class="L11584" rel="L11584"></li>
<li class="L11585" rel="L11585">“Yes, citizen.”</li>
<li class="L11586" rel="L11586"></li>
<li class="L11587" rel="L11587">“Ah! But it&#39;s not my business. My work is my business. See my saw! I</li>
<li class="L11588" rel="L11588">call it my Little Guillotine. La, la, la; La, la, la! And off his head</li>
<li class="L11589" rel="L11589">comes!”</li>
<li class="L11590" rel="L11590"></li>
<li class="L11591" rel="L11591">The billet fell as he spoke, and he threw it into a basket.</li>
<li class="L11592" rel="L11592"></li>
<li class="L11593" rel="L11593">“I call myself the Samson of the firewood guillotine. See here again!</li>
<li class="L11594" rel="L11594">Loo, loo, loo; Loo, loo, loo! And off _her_ head comes! Now, a child.</li>
<li class="L11595" rel="L11595">Tickle, tickle; Pickle, pickle! And off _its_ head comes. All the</li>
<li class="L11596" rel="L11596">family!”</li>
<li class="L11597" rel="L11597"></li>
<li class="L11598" rel="L11598">Lucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket, but it was</li>
<li class="L11599" rel="L11599">impossible to be there while the wood-sawyer was at work, and not be in</li>
<li class="L11600" rel="L11600">his sight. Thenceforth, to secure his good will, she always spoke to him</li>
<li class="L11601" rel="L11601">first, and often gave him drink-money, which he readily received.</li>
<li class="L11602" rel="L11602"></li>
<li class="L11603" rel="L11603">He was an inquisitive fellow, and sometimes when she had quite forgotten</li>
<li class="L11604" rel="L11604">him in gazing at the prison roof and grates, and in lifting her heart</li>
<li class="L11605" rel="L11605">up to her husband, she would come to herself to find him looking at her,</li>
<li class="L11606" rel="L11606">with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work. “But it&#39;s</li>
<li class="L11607" rel="L11607">not my business!” he would generally say at those times, and would</li>
<li class="L11608" rel="L11608">briskly fall to his sawing again.</li>
<li class="L11609" rel="L11609"></li>
<li class="L11610" rel="L11610">In all weathers, in the snow and frost of winter, in the bitter winds of</li>
<li class="L11611" rel="L11611">spring, in the hot sunshine of summer, in the rains of autumn, and again</li>
<li class="L11612" rel="L11612">in the snow and frost of winter, Lucie passed two hours of every day at</li>
<li class="L11613" rel="L11613">this place; and every day on leaving it, she kissed the prison wall.</li>
<li class="L11614" rel="L11614">Her husband saw her (so she learned from her father) it might be once in</li>
<li class="L11615" rel="L11615">five or six times: it might be twice or thrice running: it might be, not</li>
<li class="L11616" rel="L11616">for a week or a fortnight together. It was enough that he could and did</li>
<li class="L11617" rel="L11617">see her when the chances served, and on that possibility she would have</li>
<li class="L11618" rel="L11618">waited out the day, seven days a week.</li>
<li class="L11619" rel="L11619"></li>
<li class="L11620" rel="L11620">These occupations brought her round to the December month, wherein her</li>
<li class="L11621" rel="L11621">father walked among the terrors with a steady head. On a lightly-snowing</li>
<li class="L11622" rel="L11622">afternoon she arrived at the usual corner. It was a day of some wild</li>
<li class="L11623" rel="L11623">rejoicing, and a festival. She had seen the houses, as she came along,</li>
<li class="L11624" rel="L11624">decorated with little pikes, and with little red caps stuck upon them;</li>
<li class="L11625" rel="L11625">also, with tricoloured ribbons; also, with the standard inscription</li>
<li class="L11626" rel="L11626">(tricoloured letters were the favourite), Republic One and Indivisible.</li>
<li class="L11627" rel="L11627">Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!</li>
<li class="L11628" rel="L11628"></li>
<li class="L11629" rel="L11629">The miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small, that its whole</li>
<li class="L11630" rel="L11630">surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend. He had got</li>
<li class="L11631" rel="L11631">somebody to scrawl it up for him, however, who had squeezed Death in</li>
<li class="L11632" rel="L11632">with most inappropriate difficulty. On his house-top, he displayed pike</li>
<li class="L11633" rel="L11633">and cap, as a good citizen must, and in a window he had stationed his</li>
<li class="L11634" rel="L11634">saw inscribed as his “Little Sainte Guillotine”--for the great sharp</li>
<li class="L11635" rel="L11635">female was by that time popularly canonised. His shop was shut and he</li>
<li class="L11636" rel="L11636">was not there, which was a relief to Lucie, and left her quite alone.</li>
<li class="L11637" rel="L11637"></li>
<li class="L11638" rel="L11638">But, he was not far off, for presently she heard a troubled movement</li>
<li class="L11639" rel="L11639">and a shouting coming along, which filled her with fear. A moment</li>
<li class="L11640" rel="L11640">afterwards, and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the</li>
<li class="L11641" rel="L11641">prison wall, in the midst of whom was the wood-sawyer hand in hand with</li>
<li class="L11642" rel="L11642">The Vengeance. There could not be fewer than five hundred people, and</li>
<li class="L11643" rel="L11643">they were dancing like five thousand demons. There was no other music</li>
<li class="L11644" rel="L11644">than their own singing. They danced to the popular Revolution song,</li>
<li class="L11645" rel="L11645">keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison.</li>
<li class="L11646" rel="L11646">Men and women danced together, women danced together, men danced</li>
<li class="L11647" rel="L11647">together, as hazard had brought them together. At first, they were a</li>
<li class="L11648" rel="L11648">mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags; but, as they</li>
<li class="L11649" rel="L11649">filled the place, and stopped to dance about Lucie, some ghastly</li>
<li class="L11650" rel="L11650">apparition of a dance-figure gone raving mad arose among them. They</li>
<li class="L11651" rel="L11651">advanced, retreated, struck at one another&#39;s hands, clutched at one</li>
<li class="L11652" rel="L11652">another&#39;s heads, spun round alone, caught one another and spun round</li>
<li class="L11653" rel="L11653">in pairs, until many of them dropped. While those were down, the rest</li>
<li class="L11654" rel="L11654">linked hand in hand, and all spun round together: then the ring broke,</li>
<li class="L11655" rel="L11655">and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they</li>
<li class="L11656" rel="L11656">all stopped at once, began again, struck, clutched, and tore, and then</li>
<li class="L11657" rel="L11657">reversed the spin, and all spun round another way. Suddenly they stopped</li>
<li class="L11658" rel="L11658">again, paused, struck out the time afresh, formed into lines the width</li>
<li class="L11659" rel="L11659">of the public way, and, with their heads low down and their hands high</li>
<li class="L11660" rel="L11660">up, swooped screaming off. No fight could have been half so terrible</li>
<li class="L11661" rel="L11661">as this dance. It was so emphatically a fallen sport--a something, once</li>
<li class="L11662" rel="L11662">innocent, delivered over to all devilry--a healthy pastime changed into</li>
<li class="L11663" rel="L11663">a means of angering the blood, bewildering the senses, and steeling the</li>
<li class="L11664" rel="L11664">heart. Such grace as was visible in it, made it the uglier, showing how</li>
<li class="L11665" rel="L11665">warped and perverted all things good by nature were become. The maidenly</li>
<li class="L11666" rel="L11666">bosom bared to this, the pretty almost-child&#39;s head thus distracted, the</li>
<li class="L11667" rel="L11667">delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt, were types of</li>
<li class="L11668" rel="L11668">the disjointed time.</li>
<li class="L11669" rel="L11669"></li>
<li class="L11670" rel="L11670">This was the Carmagnole. As it passed, leaving Lucie frightened and</li>
<li class="L11671" rel="L11671">bewildered in the doorway of the wood-sawyer&#39;s house, the feathery snow</li>
<li class="L11672" rel="L11672">fell as quietly and lay as white and soft, as if it had never been.</li>
<li class="L11673" rel="L11673"></li>
<li class="L11674" rel="L11674">“O my father!” for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes she</li>
<li class="L11675" rel="L11675">had momentarily darkened with her hand; “such a cruel, bad sight.”</li>
<li class="L11676" rel="L11676"></li>
<li class="L11677" rel="L11677">“I know, my dear, I know. I have seen it many times. Don&#39;t be</li>
<li class="L11678" rel="L11678">frightened! Not one of them would harm you.”</li>
<li class="L11679" rel="L11679"></li>
<li class="L11680" rel="L11680">“I am not frightened for myself, my father. But when I think of my</li>
<li class="L11681" rel="L11681">husband, and the mercies of these people--”</li>
<li class="L11682" rel="L11682"></li>
<li class="L11683" rel="L11683">“We will set him above their mercies very soon. I left him climbing to</li>
<li class="L11684" rel="L11684">the window, and I came to tell you. There is no one here to see. You may</li>
<li class="L11685" rel="L11685">kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof.”</li>
<li class="L11686" rel="L11686"></li>
<li class="L11687" rel="L11687">“I do so, father, and I send him my Soul with it!”</li>
<li class="L11688" rel="L11688"></li>
<li class="L11689" rel="L11689">“You cannot see him, my poor dear?”</li>
<li class="L11690" rel="L11690"></li>
<li class="L11691" rel="L11691">“No, father,” said Lucie, yearning and weeping as she kissed her hand,</li>
<li class="L11692" rel="L11692">“no.”</li>
<li class="L11693" rel="L11693"></li>
<li class="L11694" rel="L11694">A footstep in the snow. Madame Defarge. “I salute you, citizeness,”</li>
<li class="L11695" rel="L11695"> from the Doctor. “I salute you, citizen.” This in passing. Nothing more.</li>
<li class="L11696" rel="L11696">Madame Defarge gone, like a shadow over the white road.</li>
<li class="L11697" rel="L11697"></li>
<li class="L11698" rel="L11698">“Give me your arm, my love. Pass from here with an air of cheerfulness</li>
<li class="L11699" rel="L11699">and courage, for his sake. That was well done;” they had left the spot;</li>
<li class="L11700" rel="L11700">“it shall not be in vain. Charles is summoned for to-morrow.”</li>
<li class="L11701" rel="L11701"></li>
<li class="L11702" rel="L11702">“For to-morrow!”</li>
<li class="L11703" rel="L11703"></li>
<li class="L11704" rel="L11704">“There is no time to lose. I am well prepared, but there are precautions</li>
<li class="L11705" rel="L11705">to be taken, that could not be taken until he was actually summoned</li>
<li class="L11706" rel="L11706">before the Tribunal. He has not received the notice yet, but I know</li>
<li class="L11707" rel="L11707">that he will presently be summoned for to-morrow, and removed to the</li>
<li class="L11708" rel="L11708">Conciergerie; I have timely information. You are not afraid?”</li>
<li class="L11709" rel="L11709"></li>
<li class="L11710" rel="L11710">She could scarcely answer, “I trust in you.”</li>
<li class="L11711" rel="L11711"></li>
<li class="L11712" rel="L11712">“Do so, implicitly. Your suspense is nearly ended, my darling; he shall</li>
<li class="L11713" rel="L11713">be restored to you within a few hours; I have encompassed him with every</li>
<li class="L11714" rel="L11714">protection. I must see Lorry.”</li>
<li class="L11715" rel="L11715"></li>
<li class="L11716" rel="L11716">He stopped. There was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing. They</li>
<li class="L11717" rel="L11717">both knew too well what it meant. One. Two. Three. Three tumbrils faring</li>
<li class="L11718" rel="L11718">away with their dread loads over the hushing snow.</li>
<li class="L11719" rel="L11719"></li>
<li class="L11720" rel="L11720">“I must see Lorry,” the Doctor repeated, turning her another way.</li>
<li class="L11721" rel="L11721"></li>
<li class="L11722" rel="L11722">The staunch old gentleman was still in his trust; had never left it. He</li>
<li class="L11723" rel="L11723">and his books were in frequent requisition as to property confiscated</li>
<li class="L11724" rel="L11724">and made national. What he could save for the owners, he saved. No</li>
<li class="L11725" rel="L11725">better man living to hold fast by what Tellson&#39;s had in keeping, and to</li>
<li class="L11726" rel="L11726">hold his peace.</li>
<li class="L11727" rel="L11727"></li>
<li class="L11728" rel="L11728">A murky red and yellow sky, and a rising mist from the Seine, denoted</li>
<li class="L11729" rel="L11729">the approach of darkness. It was almost dark when they arrived at the</li>
<li class="L11730" rel="L11730">Bank. The stately residence of Monseigneur was altogether blighted and</li>
<li class="L11731" rel="L11731">deserted. Above a heap of dust and ashes in the court, ran the letters:</li>
<li class="L11732" rel="L11732">National Property. Republic One and Indivisible. Liberty, Equality,</li>
<li class="L11733" rel="L11733">Fraternity, or Death!</li>
<li class="L11734" rel="L11734"></li>
<li class="L11735" rel="L11735">Who could that be with Mr. Lorry--the owner of the riding-coat upon the</li>
<li class="L11736" rel="L11736">chair--who must not be seen? From whom newly arrived, did he come out,</li>
<li class="L11737" rel="L11737">agitated and surprised, to take his favourite in his arms? To whom did</li>
<li class="L11738" rel="L11738">he appear to repeat her faltering words, when, raising his voice and</li>
<li class="L11739" rel="L11739">turning his head towards the door of the room from which he had issued,</li>
<li class="L11740" rel="L11740">he said: “Removed to the Conciergerie, and summoned for to-morrow?”</li>
<li class="L11741" rel="L11741"></li>
<li class="L11742" rel="L11742"></li>
<li class="L11743" rel="L11743"></li>
<li class="L11744" rel="L11744"></li>
<li class="L11745" rel="L11745">VI. Triumph</li>
<li class="L11746" rel="L11746"></li>
<li class="L11747" rel="L11747"></li>
<li class="L11748" rel="L11748">The dread tribunal of five Judges, Public Prosecutor, and determined</li>
<li class="L11749" rel="L11749">Jury, sat every day. Their lists went forth every evening, and were</li>
<li class="L11750" rel="L11750">read out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners. The</li>
<li class="L11751" rel="L11751">standard gaoler-joke was, “Come out and listen to the Evening Paper, you</li>
<li class="L11752" rel="L11752">inside there!”</li>
<li class="L11753" rel="L11753"></li>
<li class="L11754" rel="L11754">“Charles Evremonde, called Darnay!”</li>
<li class="L11755" rel="L11755"></li>
<li class="L11756" rel="L11756">So at last began the Evening Paper at La Force.</li>
<li class="L11757" rel="L11757"></li>
<li class="L11758" rel="L11758">When a name was called, its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved</li>
<li class="L11759" rel="L11759">for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded. Charles</li>
<li class="L11760" rel="L11760">Evremonde, called Darnay, had reason to know the usage; he had seen</li>
<li class="L11761" rel="L11761">hundreds pass away so.</li>
<li class="L11762" rel="L11762"></li>
<li class="L11763" rel="L11763">His bloated gaoler, who wore spectacles to read with, glanced over them</li>
<li class="L11764" rel="L11764">to assure himself that he had taken his place, and went through the</li>
<li class="L11765" rel="L11765">list, making a similar short pause at each name. There were twenty-three</li>
<li class="L11766" rel="L11766">names, but only twenty were responded to; for one of the prisoners so</li>
<li class="L11767" rel="L11767">summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten, and two had already been</li>
<li class="L11768" rel="L11768">guillotined and forgotten. The list was read, in the vaulted chamber</li>
<li class="L11769" rel="L11769">where Darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his</li>
<li class="L11770" rel="L11770">arrival. Every one of those had perished in the massacre; every human</li>
<li class="L11771" rel="L11771">creature he had since cared for and parted with, had died on the</li>
<li class="L11772" rel="L11772">scaffold.</li>
<li class="L11773" rel="L11773"></li>
<li class="L11774" rel="L11774">There were hurried words of farewell and kindness, but the parting was</li>
<li class="L11775" rel="L11775">soon over. It was the incident of every day, and the society of La Force</li>
<li class="L11776" rel="L11776">were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little</li>
<li class="L11777" rel="L11777">concert, for that evening. They crowded to the grates and shed tears</li>
<li class="L11778" rel="L11778">there; but, twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be</li>
<li class="L11779" rel="L11779">refilled, and the time was, at best, short to the lock-up hour, when the</li>
<li class="L11780" rel="L11780">common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs</li>
<li class="L11781" rel="L11781">who kept watch there through the night. The prisoners were far from</li>
<li class="L11782" rel="L11782">insensible or unfeeling; their ways arose out of the condition of the</li>
<li class="L11783" rel="L11783">time. Similarly, though with a subtle difference, a species of fervour</li>
<li class="L11784" rel="L11784">or intoxication, known, without doubt, to have led some persons to</li>
<li class="L11785" rel="L11785">brave the guillotine unnecessarily, and to die by it, was not mere</li>
<li class="L11786" rel="L11786">boastfulness, but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind. In</li>
<li class="L11787" rel="L11787">seasons of pestilence, some of us will have a secret attraction to the</li>
<li class="L11788" rel="L11788">disease--a terrible passing inclination to die of it. And all of us have</li>
<li class="L11789" rel="L11789">like wonders hidden in our breasts, only needing circumstances to evoke</li>
<li class="L11790" rel="L11790">them.</li>
<li class="L11791" rel="L11791"></li>
<li class="L11792" rel="L11792">The passage to the Conciergerie was short and dark; the night in its</li>
<li class="L11793" rel="L11793">vermin-haunted cells was long and cold. Next day, fifteen prisoners were</li>
<li class="L11794" rel="L11794">put to the bar before Charles Darnay&#39;s name was called. All the fifteen</li>
<li class="L11795" rel="L11795">were condemned, and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half.</li>
<li class="L11796" rel="L11796"></li>
<li class="L11797" rel="L11797">“Charles Evremonde, called Darnay,” was at length arraigned.</li>
<li class="L11798" rel="L11798"></li>
<li class="L11799" rel="L11799">His judges sat upon the Bench in feathered hats; but the rough red cap</li>
<li class="L11800" rel="L11800">and tricoloured cockade was the head-dress otherwise prevailing. Looking</li>
<li class="L11801" rel="L11801">at the Jury and the turbulent audience, he might have thought that the</li>
<li class="L11802" rel="L11802">usual order of things was reversed, and that the felons were trying the</li>
<li class="L11803" rel="L11803">honest men. The lowest, cruelest, and worst populace of a city, never</li>
<li class="L11804" rel="L11804">without its quantity of low, cruel, and bad, were the directing</li>
<li class="L11805" rel="L11805">spirits of the scene: noisily commenting, applauding, disapproving,</li>
<li class="L11806" rel="L11806">anticipating, and precipitating the result, without a check. Of the men,</li>
<li class="L11807" rel="L11807">the greater part were armed in various ways; of the women, some wore</li>
<li class="L11808" rel="L11808">knives, some daggers, some ate and drank as they looked on, many</li>
<li class="L11809" rel="L11809">knitted. Among these last, was one, with a spare piece of knitting under</li>
<li class="L11810" rel="L11810">her arm as she worked. She was in a front row, by the side of a man whom</li>
<li class="L11811" rel="L11811">he had never seen since his arrival at the Barrier, but whom he directly</li>
<li class="L11812" rel="L11812">remembered as Defarge. He noticed that she once or twice whispered in</li>
<li class="L11813" rel="L11813">his ear, and that she seemed to be his wife; but, what he most noticed</li>
<li class="L11814" rel="L11814">in the two figures was, that although they were posted as close to</li>
<li class="L11815" rel="L11815">himself as they could be, they never looked towards him. They seemed to</li>
<li class="L11816" rel="L11816">be waiting for something with a dogged determination, and they looked at</li>
<li class="L11817" rel="L11817">the Jury, but at nothing else. Under the President sat Doctor Manette,</li>
<li class="L11818" rel="L11818">in his usual quiet dress. As well as the prisoner could see, he and Mr.</li>
<li class="L11819" rel="L11819">Lorry were the only men there, unconnected with the Tribunal, who</li>
<li class="L11820" rel="L11820">wore their usual clothes, and had not assumed the coarse garb of the</li>
<li class="L11821" rel="L11821">Carmagnole.</li>
<li class="L11822" rel="L11822"></li>
<li class="L11823" rel="L11823">Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, was accused by the public prosecutor</li>
<li class="L11824" rel="L11824">as an emigrant, whose life was forfeit to the Republic, under the decree</li>
<li class="L11825" rel="L11825">which banished all emigrants on pain of Death. It was nothing that the</li>
<li class="L11826" rel="L11826">decree bore date since his return to France. There he was, and there was</li>
<li class="L11827" rel="L11827">the decree; he had been taken in France, and his head was demanded.</li>
<li class="L11828" rel="L11828"></li>
<li class="L11829" rel="L11829">“Take off his head!” cried the audience. “An enemy to the Republic!”</li>
<li class="L11830" rel="L11830"></li>
<li class="L11831" rel="L11831">The President rang his bell to silence those cries, and asked the</li>
<li class="L11832" rel="L11832">prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in</li>
<li class="L11833" rel="L11833">England?</li>
<li class="L11834" rel="L11834"></li>
<li class="L11835" rel="L11835">Undoubtedly it was.</li>
<li class="L11836" rel="L11836"></li>
<li class="L11837" rel="L11837">Was he not an emigrant then? What did he call himself?</li>
<li class="L11838" rel="L11838"></li>
<li class="L11839" rel="L11839">Not an emigrant, he hoped, within the sense and spirit of the law.</li>
<li class="L11840" rel="L11840"></li>
<li class="L11841" rel="L11841">Why not? the President desired to know.</li>
<li class="L11842" rel="L11842"></li>
<li class="L11843" rel="L11843">Because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful</li>
<li class="L11844" rel="L11844">to him, and a station that was distasteful to him, and had left</li>
<li class="L11845" rel="L11845">his country--he submitted before the word emigrant in the present</li>
<li class="L11846" rel="L11846">acceptation by the Tribunal was in use--to live by his own industry in</li>
<li class="L11847" rel="L11847">England, rather than on the industry of the overladen people of France.</li>
<li class="L11848" rel="L11848"></li>
<li class="L11849" rel="L11849">What proof had he of this?</li>
<li class="L11850" rel="L11850"></li>
<li class="L11851" rel="L11851">He handed in the names of two witnesses; Theophile Gabelle, and</li>
<li class="L11852" rel="L11852">Alexandre Manette.</li>
<li class="L11853" rel="L11853"></li>
<li class="L11854" rel="L11854">But he had married in England? the President reminded him.</li>
<li class="L11855" rel="L11855"></li>
<li class="L11856" rel="L11856">True, but not an English woman.</li>
<li class="L11857" rel="L11857"></li>
<li class="L11858" rel="L11858">A citizeness of France?</li>
<li class="L11859" rel="L11859"></li>
<li class="L11860" rel="L11860">Yes. By birth.</li>
<li class="L11861" rel="L11861"></li>
<li class="L11862" rel="L11862">Her name and family?</li>
<li class="L11863" rel="L11863"></li>
<li class="L11864" rel="L11864">“Lucie Manette, only daughter of Doctor Manette, the good physician who</li>
<li class="L11865" rel="L11865">sits there.”</li>
<li class="L11866" rel="L11866"></li>
<li class="L11867" rel="L11867">This answer had a happy effect upon the audience. Cries in exaltation</li>
<li class="L11868" rel="L11868">of the well-known good physician rent the hall. So capriciously were</li>
<li class="L11869" rel="L11869">the people moved, that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious</li>
<li class="L11870" rel="L11870">countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before, as</li>
<li class="L11871" rel="L11871">if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him.</li>
<li class="L11872" rel="L11872"></li>
<li class="L11873" rel="L11873">On these few steps of his dangerous way, Charles Darnay had set his foot</li>
<li class="L11874" rel="L11874">according to Doctor Manette&#39;s reiterated instructions. The same cautious</li>
<li class="L11875" rel="L11875">counsel directed every step that lay before him, and had prepared every</li>
<li class="L11876" rel="L11876">inch of his road.</li>
<li class="L11877" rel="L11877"></li>
<li class="L11878" rel="L11878">The President asked, why had he returned to France when he did, and not</li>
<li class="L11879" rel="L11879">sooner?</li>
<li class="L11880" rel="L11880"></li>
<li class="L11881" rel="L11881">He had not returned sooner, he replied, simply because he had no means</li>
<li class="L11882" rel="L11882">of living in France, save those he had resigned; whereas, in England,</li>
<li class="L11883" rel="L11883">he lived by giving instruction in the French language and literature.</li>
<li class="L11884" rel="L11884">He had returned when he did, on the pressing and written entreaty of</li>
<li class="L11885" rel="L11885">a French citizen, who represented that his life was endangered by his</li>
<li class="L11886" rel="L11886">absence. He had come back, to save a citizen&#39;s life, and to bear his</li>
<li class="L11887" rel="L11887">testimony, at whatever personal hazard, to the truth. Was that criminal</li>
<li class="L11888" rel="L11888">in the eyes of the Republic?</li>
<li class="L11889" rel="L11889"></li>
<li class="L11890" rel="L11890">The populace cried enthusiastically, “No!” and the President rang his</li>
<li class="L11891" rel="L11891">bell to quiet them. Which it did not, for they continued to cry “No!”</li>
<li class="L11892" rel="L11892"> until they left off, of their own will.</li>
<li class="L11893" rel="L11893"></li>
<li class="L11894" rel="L11894">The President required the name of that citizen. The accused explained</li>
<li class="L11895" rel="L11895">that the citizen was his first witness. He also referred with confidence</li>
<li class="L11896" rel="L11896">to the citizen&#39;s letter, which had been taken from him at the Barrier,</li>
<li class="L11897" rel="L11897">but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before</li>
<li class="L11898" rel="L11898">the President.</li>
<li class="L11899" rel="L11899"></li>
<li class="L11900" rel="L11900">The Doctor had taken care that it should be there--had assured him that</li>
<li class="L11901" rel="L11901">it would be there--and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced</li>
<li class="L11902" rel="L11902">and read. Citizen Gabelle was called to confirm it, and did so. Citizen</li>
<li class="L11903" rel="L11903">Gabelle hinted, with infinite delicacy and politeness, that in the</li>
<li class="L11904" rel="L11904">pressure of business imposed on the Tribunal by the multitude of</li>
<li class="L11905" rel="L11905">enemies of the Republic with which it had to deal, he had been slightly</li>
<li class="L11906" rel="L11906">overlooked in his prison of the Abbaye--in fact, had rather passed out</li>
<li class="L11907" rel="L11907">of the Tribunal&#39;s patriotic remembrance--until three days ago; when he</li>
<li class="L11908" rel="L11908">had been summoned before it, and had been set at liberty on the Jury&#39;s</li>
<li class="L11909" rel="L11909">declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was</li>
<li class="L11910" rel="L11910">answered, as to himself, by the surrender of the citizen Evremonde,</li>
<li class="L11911" rel="L11911">called Darnay.</li>
<li class="L11912" rel="L11912"></li>
<li class="L11913" rel="L11913">Doctor Manette was next questioned. His high personal popularity,</li>
<li class="L11914" rel="L11914">and the clearness of his answers, made a great impression; but, as he</li>
<li class="L11915" rel="L11915">proceeded, as he showed that the Accused was his first friend on his</li>
<li class="L11916" rel="L11916">release from his long imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in</li>
<li class="L11917" rel="L11917">England, always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in</li>
<li class="L11918" rel="L11918">their exile; that, so far from being in favour with the Aristocrat</li>
<li class="L11919" rel="L11919">government there, he had actually been tried for his life by it, as</li>
<li class="L11920" rel="L11920">the foe of England and friend of the United States--as he brought these</li>
<li class="L11921" rel="L11921">circumstances into view, with the greatest discretion and with the</li>
<li class="L11922" rel="L11922">straightforward force of truth and earnestness, the Jury and the</li>
<li class="L11923" rel="L11923">populace became one. At last, when he appealed by name to Monsieur</li>
<li class="L11924" rel="L11924">Lorry, an English gentleman then and there present, who, like himself,</li>
<li class="L11925" rel="L11925">had been a witness on that English trial and could corroborate his</li>
<li class="L11926" rel="L11926">account of it, the Jury declared that they had heard enough, and that</li>
<li class="L11927" rel="L11927">they were ready with their votes if the President were content to</li>
<li class="L11928" rel="L11928">receive them.</li>
<li class="L11929" rel="L11929"></li>
<li class="L11930" rel="L11930">At every vote (the Jurymen voted aloud and individually), the populace</li>
<li class="L11931" rel="L11931">set up a shout of applause. All the voices were in the prisoner&#39;s</li>
<li class="L11932" rel="L11932">favour, and the President declared him free.</li>
<li class="L11933" rel="L11933"></li>
<li class="L11934" rel="L11934">Then, began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace</li>
<li class="L11935" rel="L11935">sometimes gratified their fickleness, or their better impulses towards</li>
<li class="L11936" rel="L11936">generosity and mercy, or which they regarded as some set-off against</li>
<li class="L11937" rel="L11937">their swollen account of cruel rage. No man can decide now to which of</li>
<li class="L11938" rel="L11938">these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable; it is probable,</li>
<li class="L11939" rel="L11939">to a blending of all the three, with the second predominating. No sooner</li>
<li class="L11940" rel="L11940">was the acquittal pronounced, than tears were shed as freely as blood</li>
<li class="L11941" rel="L11941">at another time, and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the</li>
<li class="L11942" rel="L11942">prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him, that after</li>
<li class="L11943" rel="L11943">his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from</li>
<li class="L11944" rel="L11944">exhaustion; none the less because he knew very well, that the very same</li>
<li class="L11945" rel="L11945">people, carried by another current, would have rushed at him with</li>
<li class="L11946" rel="L11946">the very same intensity, to rend him to pieces and strew him over the</li>
<li class="L11947" rel="L11947">streets.</li>
<li class="L11948" rel="L11948"></li>
<li class="L11949" rel="L11949">His removal, to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried,</li>
<li class="L11950" rel="L11950">rescued him from these caresses for the moment. Five were to be tried</li>
<li class="L11951" rel="L11951">together, next, as enemies of the Republic, forasmuch as they had not</li>
<li class="L11952" rel="L11952">assisted it by word or deed. So quick was the Tribunal to compensate</li>
<li class="L11953" rel="L11953">itself and the nation for a chance lost, that these five came down to</li>
<li class="L11954" rel="L11954">him before he left the place, condemned to die within twenty-four</li>
<li class="L11955" rel="L11955">hours. The first of them told him so, with the customary prison sign</li>
<li class="L11956" rel="L11956">of Death--a raised finger--and they all added in words, “Long live the</li>
<li class="L11957" rel="L11957">Republic!”</li>
<li class="L11958" rel="L11958"></li>
<li class="L11959" rel="L11959">The five had had, it is true, no audience to lengthen their proceedings,</li>
<li class="L11960" rel="L11960">for when he and Doctor Manette emerged from the gate, there was a great</li>
<li class="L11961" rel="L11961">crowd about it, in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in</li>
<li class="L11962" rel="L11962">Court--except two, for which he looked in vain. On his coming out, the</li>
<li class="L11963" rel="L11963">concourse made at him anew, weeping, embracing, and shouting, all by</li>
<li class="L11964" rel="L11964">turns and all together, until the very tide of the river on the bank of</li>
<li class="L11965" rel="L11965">which the mad scene was acted, seemed to run mad, like the people on the</li>
<li class="L11966" rel="L11966">shore.</li>
<li class="L11967" rel="L11967"></li>
<li class="L11968" rel="L11968">They put him into a great chair they had among them, and which they had</li>
<li class="L11969" rel="L11969">taken either out of the Court itself, or one of its rooms or passages.</li>
<li class="L11970" rel="L11970">Over the chair they had thrown a red flag, and to the back of it they</li>
<li class="L11971" rel="L11971">had bound a pike with a red cap on its top. In this car of triumph, not</li>
<li class="L11972" rel="L11972">even the Doctor&#39;s entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home</li>
<li class="L11973" rel="L11973">on men&#39;s shoulders, with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him,</li>
<li class="L11974" rel="L11974">and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces, that</li>
<li class="L11975" rel="L11975">he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion, and that he</li>
<li class="L11976" rel="L11976">was in the tumbril on his way to the Guillotine.</li>
<li class="L11977" rel="L11977"></li>
<li class="L11978" rel="L11978">In wild dreamlike procession, embracing whom they met and pointing</li>
<li class="L11979" rel="L11979">him out, they carried him on. Reddening the snowy streets with the</li>
<li class="L11980" rel="L11980">prevailing Republican colour, in winding and tramping through them, as</li>
<li class="L11981" rel="L11981">they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye, they carried</li>
<li class="L11982" rel="L11982">him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived. Her father</li>
<li class="L11983" rel="L11983">had gone on before, to prepare her, and when her husband stood upon his</li>
<li class="L11984" rel="L11984">feet, she dropped insensible in his arms.</li>
<li class="L11985" rel="L11985"></li>
<li class="L11986" rel="L11986">As he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his</li>
<li class="L11987" rel="L11987">face and the brawling crowd, so that his tears and her lips might come</li>
<li class="L11988" rel="L11988">together unseen, a few of the people fell to dancing. Instantly, all the</li>
<li class="L11989" rel="L11989">rest fell to dancing, and the courtyard overflowed with the Carmagnole.</li>
<li class="L11990" rel="L11990">Then, they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the</li>
<li class="L11991" rel="L11991">crowd to be carried as the Goddess of Liberty, and then swelling and</li>
<li class="L11992" rel="L11992">overflowing out into the adjacent streets, and along the river&#39;s bank,</li>
<li class="L11993" rel="L11993">and over the bridge, the Carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled</li>
<li class="L11994" rel="L11994">them away.</li>
<li class="L11995" rel="L11995"></li>
<li class="L11996" rel="L11996">After grasping the Doctor&#39;s hand, as he stood victorious and proud</li>
<li class="L11997" rel="L11997">before him; after grasping the hand of Mr. Lorry, who came panting in</li>
<li class="L11998" rel="L11998">breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the Carmagnole;</li>
<li class="L11999" rel="L11999">after kissing little Lucie, who was lifted up to clasp her arms round</li>
<li class="L12000" rel="L12000">his neck; and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful Pross who</li>
<li class="L12001" rel="L12001">lifted her; he took his wife in his arms, and carried her up to their</li>
<li class="L12002" rel="L12002">rooms.</li>
<li class="L12003" rel="L12003"></li>
<li class="L12004" rel="L12004">“Lucie! My own! I am safe.”</li>
<li class="L12005" rel="L12005"></li>
<li class="L12006" rel="L12006">“O dearest Charles, let me thank God for this on my knees as I have</li>
<li class="L12007" rel="L12007">prayed to Him.”</li>
<li class="L12008" rel="L12008"></li>
<li class="L12009" rel="L12009">They all reverently bowed their heads and hearts. When she was again in</li>
<li class="L12010" rel="L12010">his arms, he said to her:</li>
<li class="L12011" rel="L12011"></li>
<li class="L12012" rel="L12012">“And now speak to your father, dearest. No other man in all this France</li>
<li class="L12013" rel="L12013">could have done what he has done for me.”</li>
<li class="L12014" rel="L12014"></li>
<li class="L12015" rel="L12015">She laid her head upon her father&#39;s breast, as she had laid his poor</li>
<li class="L12016" rel="L12016">head on her own breast, long, long ago. He was happy in the return he</li>
<li class="L12017" rel="L12017">had made her, he was recompensed for his suffering, he was proud of his</li>
<li class="L12018" rel="L12018">strength. “You must not be weak, my darling,” he remonstrated; “don&#39;t</li>
<li class="L12019" rel="L12019">tremble so. I have saved him.”</li>
<li class="L12020" rel="L12020"></li>
<li class="L12021" rel="L12021"></li>
<li class="L12022" rel="L12022"></li>
<li class="L12023" rel="L12023"></li>
<li class="L12024" rel="L12024">VII. A Knock at the Door</li>
<li class="L12025" rel="L12025"></li>
<li class="L12026" rel="L12026"></li>
<li class="L12027" rel="L12027">“I have saved him.” It was not another of the dreams in which he had</li>
<li class="L12028" rel="L12028">often come back; he was really here. And yet his wife trembled, and a</li>
<li class="L12029" rel="L12029">vague but heavy fear was upon her.</li>
<li class="L12030" rel="L12030"></li>
<li class="L12031" rel="L12031">All the air round was so thick and dark, the people were so passionately</li>
<li class="L12032" rel="L12032">revengeful and fitful, the innocent were so constantly put to death on</li>
<li class="L12033" rel="L12033">vague suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible to forget that</li>
<li class="L12034" rel="L12034">many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to</li>
<li class="L12035" rel="L12035">her, every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched, that her</li>
<li class="L12036" rel="L12036">heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be.</li>
<li class="L12037" rel="L12037">The shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall, and even now</li>
<li class="L12038" rel="L12038">the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets. Her mind pursued</li>
<li class="L12039" rel="L12039">them, looking for him among the Condemned; and then she clung closer to</li>
<li class="L12040" rel="L12040">his real presence and trembled more.</li>
<li class="L12041" rel="L12041"></li>
<li class="L12042" rel="L12042">Her father, cheering her, showed a compassionate superiority to this</li>
<li class="L12043" rel="L12043">woman&#39;s weakness, which was wonderful to see. No garret, no shoemaking,</li>
<li class="L12044" rel="L12044">no One Hundred and Five, North Tower, now! He had accomplished the task</li>
<li class="L12045" rel="L12045">he had set himself, his promise was redeemed, he had saved Charles. Let</li>
<li class="L12046" rel="L12046">them all lean upon him.</li>
<li class="L12047" rel="L12047"></li>
<li class="L12048" rel="L12048">Their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind: not only because that was</li>
<li class="L12049" rel="L12049">the safest way of life, involving the least offence to the people, but</li>
<li class="L12050" rel="L12050">because they were not rich, and Charles, throughout his imprisonment,</li>
<li class="L12051" rel="L12051">had had to pay heavily for his bad food, and for his guard, and towards</li>
<li class="L12052" rel="L12052">the living of the poorer prisoners. Partly on this account, and</li>
<li class="L12053" rel="L12053">partly to avoid a domestic spy, they kept no servant; the citizen and</li>
<li class="L12054" rel="L12054">citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate, rendered them</li>
<li class="L12055" rel="L12055">occasional service; and Jerry (almost wholly transferred to them by</li>
<li class="L12056" rel="L12056">Mr. Lorry) had become their daily retainer, and had his bed there every</li>
<li class="L12057" rel="L12057">night.</li>
<li class="L12058" rel="L12058"></li>
<li class="L12059" rel="L12059">It was an ordinance of the Republic One and Indivisible of Liberty,</li>
<li class="L12060" rel="L12060">Equality, Fraternity, or Death, that on the door or doorpost of every</li>
<li class="L12061" rel="L12061">house, the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters</li>
<li class="L12062" rel="L12062">of a certain size, at a certain convenient height from the ground. Mr.</li>
<li class="L12063" rel="L12063">Jerry Cruncher&#39;s name, therefore, duly embellished the doorpost down</li>
<li class="L12064" rel="L12064">below; and, as the afternoon shadows deepened, the owner of that name</li>
<li class="L12065" rel="L12065">himself appeared, from overlooking a painter whom Doctor Manette had</li>
<li class="L12066" rel="L12066">employed to add to the list the name of Charles Evremonde, called</li>
<li class="L12067" rel="L12067">Darnay.</li>
<li class="L12068" rel="L12068"></li>
<li class="L12069" rel="L12069">In the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time, all the usual</li>
<li class="L12070" rel="L12070">harmless ways of life were changed. In the Doctor&#39;s little household, as</li>
<li class="L12071" rel="L12071">in very many others, the articles of daily consumption that were wanted</li>
<li class="L12072" rel="L12072">were purchased every evening, in small quantities and at various small</li>
<li class="L12073" rel="L12073">shops. To avoid attracting notice, and to give as little occasion as</li>
<li class="L12074" rel="L12074">possible for talk and envy, was the general desire.</li>
<li class="L12075" rel="L12075"></li>
<li class="L12076" rel="L12076">For some months past, Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher had discharged the</li>
<li class="L12077" rel="L12077">office of purveyors; the former carrying the money; the latter, the</li>
<li class="L12078" rel="L12078">basket. Every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were</li>
<li class="L12079" rel="L12079">lighted, they fared forth on this duty, and made and brought home</li>
<li class="L12080" rel="L12080">such purchases as were needful. Although Miss Pross, through her long</li>
<li class="L12081" rel="L12081">association with a French family, might have known as much of their</li>
<li class="L12082" rel="L12082">language as of her own, if she had had a mind, she had no mind in that</li>
<li class="L12083" rel="L12083">direction; consequently she knew no more of that “nonsense” (as she was</li>
<li class="L12084" rel="L12084">pleased to call it) than Mr. Cruncher did. So her manner of marketing</li>
<li class="L12085" rel="L12085">was to plump a noun-substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any</li>
<li class="L12086" rel="L12086">introduction in the nature of an article, and, if it happened not to be</li>
<li class="L12087" rel="L12087">the name of the thing she wanted, to look round for that thing, lay hold</li>
<li class="L12088" rel="L12088">of it, and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded. She always</li>
<li class="L12089" rel="L12089">made a bargain for it, by holding up, as a statement of its just price,</li>
<li class="L12090" rel="L12090">one finger less than the merchant held up, whatever his number might be.</li>
<li class="L12091" rel="L12091"></li>
<li class="L12092" rel="L12092">“Now, Mr. Cruncher,” said Miss Pross, whose eyes were red with felicity;</li>
<li class="L12093" rel="L12093">“if you are ready, I am.”</li>
<li class="L12094" rel="L12094"></li>
<li class="L12095" rel="L12095">Jerry hoarsely professed himself at Miss Pross&#39;s service. He had worn</li>
<li class="L12096" rel="L12096">all his rust off long ago, but nothing would file his spiky head down.</li>
<li class="L12097" rel="L12097"></li>
<li class="L12098" rel="L12098">“There&#39;s all manner of things wanted,” said Miss Pross, “and we shall</li>
<li class="L12099" rel="L12099">have a precious time of it. We want wine, among the rest. Nice toasts</li>
<li class="L12100" rel="L12100">these Redheads will be drinking, wherever we buy it.”</li>
<li class="L12101" rel="L12101"></li>
<li class="L12102" rel="L12102">“It will be much the same to your knowledge, miss, I should think,”</li>
<li class="L12103" rel="L12103"> retorted Jerry, “whether they drink your health or the Old Un&#39;s.”</li>
<li class="L12104" rel="L12104"></li>
<li class="L12105" rel="L12105">“Who&#39;s he?” said Miss Pross.</li>
<li class="L12106" rel="L12106"></li>
<li class="L12107" rel="L12107">Mr. Cruncher, with some diffidence, explained himself as meaning “Old</li>
<li class="L12108" rel="L12108">Nick&#39;s.”</li>
<li class="L12109" rel="L12109"></li>
<li class="L12110" rel="L12110">“Ha!” said Miss Pross, “it doesn&#39;t need an interpreter to explain the</li>
<li class="L12111" rel="L12111">meaning of these creatures. They have but one, and it&#39;s Midnight Murder,</li>
<li class="L12112" rel="L12112">and Mischief.”</li>
<li class="L12113" rel="L12113"></li>
<li class="L12114" rel="L12114">“Hush, dear! Pray, pray, be cautious!” cried Lucie.</li>
<li class="L12115" rel="L12115"></li>
<li class="L12116" rel="L12116">“Yes, yes, yes, I&#39;ll be cautious,” said Miss Pross; “but I may say</li>
<li class="L12117" rel="L12117">among ourselves, that I do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey</li>
<li class="L12118" rel="L12118">smotherings in the form of embracings all round, going on in the</li>
<li class="L12119" rel="L12119">streets. Now, Ladybird, never you stir from that fire till I come back!</li>
<li class="L12120" rel="L12120">Take care of the dear husband you have recovered, and don&#39;t move your</li>
<li class="L12121" rel="L12121">pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now, till you see me again!</li>
<li class="L12122" rel="L12122">May I ask a question, Doctor Manette, before I go?”</li>
<li class="L12123" rel="L12123"></li>
<li class="L12124" rel="L12124">“I think you may take that liberty,” the Doctor answered, smiling.</li>
<li class="L12125" rel="L12125"></li>
<li class="L12126" rel="L12126">“For gracious sake, don&#39;t talk about Liberty; we have quite enough of</li>
<li class="L12127" rel="L12127">that,” said Miss Pross.</li>
<li class="L12128" rel="L12128"></li>
<li class="L12129" rel="L12129">“Hush, dear! Again?” Lucie remonstrated.</li>
<li class="L12130" rel="L12130"></li>
<li class="L12131" rel="L12131">“Well, my sweet,” said Miss Pross, nodding her head emphatically, “the</li>
<li class="L12132" rel="L12132">short and the long of it is, that I am a subject of His Most Gracious</li>
<li class="L12133" rel="L12133">Majesty King George the Third;” Miss Pross curtseyed at the name; “and</li>
<li class="L12134" rel="L12134">as such, my maxim is, Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish</li>
<li class="L12135" rel="L12135">tricks, On him our hopes we fix, God save the King!”</li>
<li class="L12136" rel="L12136"></li>
<li class="L12137" rel="L12137">Mr. Cruncher, in an access of loyalty, growlingly repeated the words</li>
<li class="L12138" rel="L12138">after Miss Pross, like somebody at church.</li>
<li class="L12139" rel="L12139"></li>
<li class="L12140" rel="L12140">“I am glad you have so much of the Englishman in you, though I wish you</li>
<li class="L12141" rel="L12141">had never taken that cold in your voice,” said Miss Pross, approvingly.</li>
<li class="L12142" rel="L12142">“But the question, Doctor Manette. Is there”--it was the good creature&#39;s</li>
<li class="L12143" rel="L12143">way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety</li>
<li class="L12144" rel="L12144">with them all, and to come at it in this chance manner--“is there any</li>
<li class="L12145" rel="L12145">prospect yet, of our getting out of this place?”</li>
<li class="L12146" rel="L12146"></li>
<li class="L12147" rel="L12147">“I fear not yet. It would be dangerous for Charles yet.”</li>
<li class="L12148" rel="L12148"></li>
<li class="L12149" rel="L12149">“Heigh-ho-hum!” said Miss Pross, cheerfully repressing a sigh as she</li>
<li class="L12150" rel="L12150">glanced at her darling&#39;s golden hair in the light of the fire, “then we</li>
<li class="L12151" rel="L12151">must have patience and wait: that&#39;s all. We must hold up our heads and</li>
<li class="L12152" rel="L12152">fight low, as my brother Solomon used to say. Now, Mr. Cruncher!--Don&#39;t</li>
<li class="L12153" rel="L12153">you move, Ladybird!”</li>
<li class="L12154" rel="L12154"></li>
<li class="L12155" rel="L12155">They went out, leaving Lucie, and her husband, her father, and the</li>
<li class="L12156" rel="L12156">child, by a bright fire. Mr. Lorry was expected back presently from the</li>
<li class="L12157" rel="L12157">Banking House. Miss Pross had lighted the lamp, but had put it aside in</li>
<li class="L12158" rel="L12158">a corner, that they might enjoy the fire-light undisturbed. Little Lucie</li>
<li class="L12159" rel="L12159">sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm: and he,</li>
<li class="L12160" rel="L12160">in a tone not rising much above a whisper, began to tell her a story of</li>
<li class="L12161" rel="L12161">a great and powerful Fairy who had opened a prison-wall and let out</li>
<li class="L12162" rel="L12162">a captive who had once done the Fairy a service. All was subdued and</li>
<li class="L12163" rel="L12163">quiet, and Lucie was more at ease than she had been.</li>
<li class="L12164" rel="L12164"></li>
<li class="L12165" rel="L12165">“What is that?” she cried, all at once.</li>
<li class="L12166" rel="L12166"></li>
<li class="L12167" rel="L12167">“My dear!” said her father, stopping in his story, and laying his hand</li>
<li class="L12168" rel="L12168">on hers, “command yourself. What a disordered state you are in! The</li>
<li class="L12169" rel="L12169">least thing--nothing--startles you! _You_, your father&#39;s daughter!”</li>
<li class="L12170" rel="L12170"></li>
<li class="L12171" rel="L12171">“I thought, my father,” said Lucie, excusing herself, with a pale face</li>
<li class="L12172" rel="L12172">and in a faltering voice, “that I heard strange feet upon the stairs.”</li>
<li class="L12173" rel="L12173"></li>
<li class="L12174" rel="L12174">“My love, the staircase is as still as Death.”</li>
<li class="L12175" rel="L12175"></li>
<li class="L12176" rel="L12176">As he said the word, a blow was struck upon the door.</li>
<li class="L12177" rel="L12177"></li>
<li class="L12178" rel="L12178">“Oh father, father. What can this be! Hide Charles. Save him!”</li>
<li class="L12179" rel="L12179"></li>
<li class="L12180" rel="L12180">“My child,” said the Doctor, rising, and laying his hand upon her</li>
<li class="L12181" rel="L12181">shoulder, “I _have_ saved him. What weakness is this, my dear! Let me go</li>
<li class="L12182" rel="L12182">to the door.”</li>
<li class="L12183" rel="L12183"></li>
<li class="L12184" rel="L12184">He took the lamp in his hand, crossed the two intervening outer rooms,</li>
<li class="L12185" rel="L12185">and opened it. A rude clattering of feet over the floor, and four rough</li>
<li class="L12186" rel="L12186">men in red caps, armed with sabres and pistols, entered the room.</li>
<li class="L12187" rel="L12187"></li>
<li class="L12188" rel="L12188">“The Citizen Evremonde, called Darnay,” said the first.</li>
<li class="L12189" rel="L12189"></li>
<li class="L12190" rel="L12190">“Who seeks him?” answered Darnay.</li>
<li class="L12191" rel="L12191"></li>
<li class="L12192" rel="L12192">“I seek him. We seek him. I know you, Evremonde; I saw you before the</li>
<li class="L12193" rel="L12193">Tribunal to-day. You are again the prisoner of the Republic.”</li>
<li class="L12194" rel="L12194"></li>
<li class="L12195" rel="L12195">The four surrounded him, where he stood with his wife and child clinging</li>
<li class="L12196" rel="L12196">to him.</li>
<li class="L12197" rel="L12197"></li>
<li class="L12198" rel="L12198">“Tell me how and why am I again a prisoner?”</li>
<li class="L12199" rel="L12199"></li>
<li class="L12200" rel="L12200">“It is enough that you return straight to the Conciergerie, and will</li>
<li class="L12201" rel="L12201">know to-morrow. You are summoned for to-morrow.”</li>
<li class="L12202" rel="L12202"></li>
<li class="L12203" rel="L12203">Doctor Manette, whom this visitation had so turned into stone, that he</li>
<li class="L12204" rel="L12204">stood with the lamp in his hand, as if he were a statue made to hold it,</li>
<li class="L12205" rel="L12205">moved after these words were spoken, put the lamp down, and confronting</li>
<li class="L12206" rel="L12206">the speaker, and taking him, not ungently, by the loose front of his red</li>
<li class="L12207" rel="L12207">woollen shirt, said:</li>
<li class="L12208" rel="L12208"></li>
<li class="L12209" rel="L12209">“You know him, you have said. Do you know me?”</li>
<li class="L12210" rel="L12210"></li>
<li class="L12211" rel="L12211">“Yes, I know you, Citizen Doctor.”</li>
<li class="L12212" rel="L12212"></li>
<li class="L12213" rel="L12213">“We all know you, Citizen Doctor,” said the other three.</li>
<li class="L12214" rel="L12214"></li>
<li class="L12215" rel="L12215">He looked abstractedly from one to another, and said, in a lower voice,</li>
<li class="L12216" rel="L12216">after a pause:</li>
<li class="L12217" rel="L12217"></li>
<li class="L12218" rel="L12218">“Will you answer his question to me then? How does this happen?”</li>
<li class="L12219" rel="L12219"></li>
<li class="L12220" rel="L12220">“Citizen Doctor,” said the first, reluctantly, “he has been denounced to</li>
<li class="L12221" rel="L12221">the Section of Saint Antoine. This citizen,” pointing out the second who</li>
<li class="L12222" rel="L12222">had entered, “is from Saint Antoine.”</li>
<li class="L12223" rel="L12223"></li>
<li class="L12224" rel="L12224">The citizen here indicated nodded his head, and added:</li>
<li class="L12225" rel="L12225"></li>
<li class="L12226" rel="L12226">“He is accused by Saint Antoine.”</li>
<li class="L12227" rel="L12227"></li>
<li class="L12228" rel="L12228">“Of what?” asked the Doctor.</li>
<li class="L12229" rel="L12229"></li>
<li class="L12230" rel="L12230">“Citizen Doctor,” said the first, with his former reluctance, “ask no</li>
<li class="L12231" rel="L12231">more. If the Republic demands sacrifices from you, without doubt you as</li>
<li class="L12232" rel="L12232">a good patriot will be happy to make them. The Republic goes before all.</li>
<li class="L12233" rel="L12233">The People is supreme. Evremonde, we are pressed.”</li>
<li class="L12234" rel="L12234"></li>
<li class="L12235" rel="L12235">“One word,” the Doctor entreated. “Will you tell me who denounced him?”</li>
<li class="L12236" rel="L12236"></li>
<li class="L12237" rel="L12237">“It is against rule,” answered the first; “but you can ask Him of Saint</li>
<li class="L12238" rel="L12238">Antoine here.”</li>
<li class="L12239" rel="L12239"></li>
<li class="L12240" rel="L12240">The Doctor turned his eyes upon that man. Who moved uneasily on his</li>
<li class="L12241" rel="L12241">feet, rubbed his beard a little, and at length said:</li>
<li class="L12242" rel="L12242"></li>
<li class="L12243" rel="L12243">“Well! Truly it is against rule. But he is denounced--and gravely--by</li>
<li class="L12244" rel="L12244">the Citizen and Citizeness Defarge. And by one other.”</li>
<li class="L12245" rel="L12245"></li>
<li class="L12246" rel="L12246">“What other?”</li>
<li class="L12247" rel="L12247"></li>
<li class="L12248" rel="L12248">“Do _you_ ask, Citizen Doctor?”</li>
<li class="L12249" rel="L12249"></li>
<li class="L12250" rel="L12250">“Yes.”</li>
<li class="L12251" rel="L12251"></li>
<li class="L12252" rel="L12252">“Then,” said he of Saint Antoine, with a strange look, “you will be</li>
<li class="L12253" rel="L12253">answered to-morrow. Now, I am dumb!”</li>
<li class="L12254" rel="L12254"></li>
<li class="L12255" rel="L12255"></li>
<li class="L12256" rel="L12256"></li>
<li class="L12257" rel="L12257"></li>
<li class="L12258" rel="L12258">VIII. A Hand at Cards</li>
<li class="L12259" rel="L12259"></li>
<li class="L12260" rel="L12260"></li>
<li class="L12261" rel="L12261">Happily unconscious of the new calamity at home, Miss Pross threaded her</li>
<li class="L12262" rel="L12262">way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the</li>
<li class="L12263" rel="L12263">Pont-Neuf, reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases</li>
<li class="L12264" rel="L12264">she had to make. Mr. Cruncher, with the basket, walked at her side. They</li>
<li class="L12265" rel="L12265">both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they</li>
<li class="L12266" rel="L12266">passed, had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people, and</li>
<li class="L12267" rel="L12267">turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers. It</li>
<li class="L12268" rel="L12268">was a raw evening, and the misty river, blurred to the eye with blazing</li>
<li class="L12269" rel="L12269">lights and to the ear with harsh noises, showed where the barges were</li>
<li class="L12270" rel="L12270">stationed in which the smiths worked, making guns for the Army of the</li>
<li class="L12271" rel="L12271">Republic. Woe to the man who played tricks with _that_ Army, or got</li>
<li class="L12272" rel="L12272">undeserved promotion in it! Better for him that his beard had never</li>
<li class="L12273" rel="L12273">grown, for the National Razor shaved him close.</li>
<li class="L12274" rel="L12274"></li>
<li class="L12275" rel="L12275">Having purchased a few small articles of grocery, and a measure of oil</li>
<li class="L12276" rel="L12276">for the lamp, Miss Pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted.</li>
<li class="L12277" rel="L12277">After peeping into several wine-shops, she stopped at the sign of the</li>
<li class="L12278" rel="L12278">Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, not far from the National Palace,</li>
<li class="L12279" rel="L12279">once (and twice) the Tuileries, where the aspect of things rather</li>
<li class="L12280" rel="L12280">took her fancy. It had a quieter look than any other place of the same</li>
<li class="L12281" rel="L12281">description they had passed, and, though red with patriotic caps, was</li>
<li class="L12282" rel="L12282">not so red as the rest. Sounding Mr. Cruncher, and finding him of her</li>
<li class="L12283" rel="L12283">opinion, Miss Pross resorted to the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity,</li>
<li class="L12284" rel="L12284">attended by her cavalier.</li>
<li class="L12285" rel="L12285"></li>
<li class="L12286" rel="L12286">Slightly observant of the smoky lights; of the people, pipe in mouth,</li>
<li class="L12287" rel="L12287">playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes; of the one bare-breasted,</li>
<li class="L12288" rel="L12288">bare-armed, soot-begrimed workman reading a journal aloud, and of</li>
<li class="L12289" rel="L12289">the others listening to him; of the weapons worn, or laid aside to be</li>
<li class="L12290" rel="L12290">resumed; of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep, who in the</li>
<li class="L12291" rel="L12291">popular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer looked, in that attitude,</li>
<li class="L12292" rel="L12292">like slumbering bears or dogs; the two outlandish customers approached</li>
<li class="L12293" rel="L12293">the counter, and showed what they wanted.</li>
<li class="L12294" rel="L12294"></li>
<li class="L12295" rel="L12295">As their wine was measuring out, a man parted from another man in a</li>
<li class="L12296" rel="L12296">corner, and rose to depart. In going, he had to face Miss Pross. No</li>
<li class="L12297" rel="L12297">sooner did he face her, than Miss Pross uttered a scream, and clapped</li>
<li class="L12298" rel="L12298">her hands.</li>
<li class="L12299" rel="L12299"></li>
<li class="L12300" rel="L12300">In a moment, the whole company were on their feet. That somebody was</li>
<li class="L12301" rel="L12301">assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the</li>
<li class="L12302" rel="L12302">likeliest occurrence. Everybody looked to see somebody fall, but only</li>
<li class="L12303" rel="L12303">saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other; the man with all</li>
<li class="L12304" rel="L12304">the outward aspect of a Frenchman and a thorough Republican; the woman,</li>
<li class="L12305" rel="L12305">evidently English.</li>
<li class="L12306" rel="L12306"></li>
<li class="L12307" rel="L12307">What was said in this disappointing anti-climax, by the disciples of the</li>
<li class="L12308" rel="L12308">Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, except that it was something very</li>
<li class="L12309" rel="L12309">voluble and loud, would have been as so much Hebrew or Chaldean to Miss</li>
<li class="L12310" rel="L12310">Pross and her protector, though they had been all ears. But, they had no</li>
<li class="L12311" rel="L12311">ears for anything in their surprise. For, it must be recorded, that</li>
<li class="L12312" rel="L12312">not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agitation, but,</li>
<li class="L12313" rel="L12313">Mr. Cruncher--though it seemed on his own separate and individual</li>
<li class="L12314" rel="L12314">account--was in a state of the greatest wonder.</li>
<li class="L12315" rel="L12315"></li>
<li class="L12316" rel="L12316">“What is the matter?” said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream;</li>
<li class="L12317" rel="L12317">speaking in a vexed, abrupt voice (though in a low tone), and in</li>
<li class="L12318" rel="L12318">English.</li>
<li class="L12319" rel="L12319"></li>
<li class="L12320" rel="L12320">“Oh, Solomon, dear Solomon!” cried Miss Pross, clapping her hands again.</li>
<li class="L12321" rel="L12321">“After not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time,</li>
<li class="L12322" rel="L12322">do I find you here!”</li>
<li class="L12323" rel="L12323"></li>
<li class="L12324" rel="L12324">“Don&#39;t call me Solomon. Do you want to be the death of me?” asked the</li>
<li class="L12325" rel="L12325">man, in a furtive, frightened way.</li>
<li class="L12326" rel="L12326"></li>
<li class="L12327" rel="L12327">“Brother, brother!” cried Miss Pross, bursting into tears. “Have I ever</li>
<li class="L12328" rel="L12328">been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question?”</li>
<li class="L12329" rel="L12329"></li>
<li class="L12330" rel="L12330">“Then hold your meddlesome tongue,” said Solomon, “and come out, if you</li>
<li class="L12331" rel="L12331">want to speak to me. Pay for your wine, and come out. Who&#39;s this man?”</li>
<li class="L12332" rel="L12332"></li>
<li class="L12333" rel="L12333">Miss Pross, shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means</li>
<li class="L12334" rel="L12334">affectionate brother, said through her tears, “Mr. Cruncher.”</li>
<li class="L12335" rel="L12335"></li>
<li class="L12336" rel="L12336">“Let him come out too,” said Solomon. “Does he think me a ghost?”</li>
<li class="L12337" rel="L12337"></li>
<li class="L12338" rel="L12338">Apparently, Mr. Cruncher did, to judge from his looks. He said not a</li>
<li class="L12339" rel="L12339">word, however, and Miss Pross, exploring the depths of her reticule</li>
<li class="L12340" rel="L12340">through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine. As she did</li>
<li class="L12341" rel="L12341">so, Solomon turned to the followers of the Good Republican Brutus</li>
<li class="L12342" rel="L12342">of Antiquity, and offered a few words of explanation in the French</li>
<li class="L12343" rel="L12343">language, which caused them all to relapse into their former places and</li>
<li class="L12344" rel="L12344">pursuits.</li>
<li class="L12345" rel="L12345"></li>
<li class="L12346" rel="L12346">“Now,” said Solomon, stopping at the dark street corner, “what do you</li>
<li class="L12347" rel="L12347">want?”</li>
<li class="L12348" rel="L12348"></li>
<li class="L12349" rel="L12349">“How dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away</li>
<li class="L12350" rel="L12350">from!” cried Miss Pross, “to give me such a greeting, and show me no</li>
<li class="L12351" rel="L12351">affection.”</li>
<li class="L12352" rel="L12352"></li>
<li class="L12353" rel="L12353">“There. Confound it! There,” said Solomon, making a dab at Miss Pross&#39;s</li>
<li class="L12354" rel="L12354">lips with his own. “Now are you content?”</li>
<li class="L12355" rel="L12355"></li>
<li class="L12356" rel="L12356">Miss Pross only shook her head and wept in silence.</li>
<li class="L12357" rel="L12357"></li>
<li class="L12358" rel="L12358">“If you expect me to be surprised,” said her brother Solomon, “I am not</li>
<li class="L12359" rel="L12359">surprised; I knew you were here; I know of most people who are here. If</li>
<li class="L12360" rel="L12360">you really don&#39;t want to endanger my existence--which I half believe you</li>
<li class="L12361" rel="L12361">do--go your ways as soon as possible, and let me go mine. I am busy. I</li>
<li class="L12362" rel="L12362">am an official.”</li>
<li class="L12363" rel="L12363"></li>
<li class="L12364" rel="L12364">“My English brother Solomon,” mourned Miss Pross, casting up her</li>
<li class="L12365" rel="L12365">tear-fraught eyes, “that had the makings in him of one of the best and</li>
<li class="L12366" rel="L12366">greatest of men in his native country, an official among foreigners, and</li>
<li class="L12367" rel="L12367">such foreigners! I would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in</li>
<li class="L12368" rel="L12368">his--”</li>
<li class="L12369" rel="L12369"></li>
<li class="L12370" rel="L12370">“I said so!” cried her brother, interrupting. “I knew it. You want to be</li>
<li class="L12371" rel="L12371">the death of me. I shall be rendered Suspected, by my own sister. Just</li>
<li class="L12372" rel="L12372">as I am getting on!”</li>
<li class="L12373" rel="L12373"></li>
<li class="L12374" rel="L12374">“The gracious and merciful Heavens forbid!” cried Miss Pross. “Far</li>
<li class="L12375" rel="L12375">rather would I never see you again, dear Solomon, though I have ever</li>
<li class="L12376" rel="L12376">loved you truly, and ever shall. Say but one affectionate word to me,</li>
<li class="L12377" rel="L12377">and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us, and I will</li>
<li class="L12378" rel="L12378">detain you no longer.”</li>
<li class="L12379" rel="L12379"></li>
<li class="L12380" rel="L12380">Good Miss Pross! As if the estrangement between them had come of any</li>
<li class="L12381" rel="L12381">culpability of hers. As if Mr. Lorry had not known it for a fact, years</li>
<li class="L12382" rel="L12382">ago, in the quiet corner in Soho, that this precious brother had spent</li>
<li class="L12383" rel="L12383">her money and left her!</li>
<li class="L12384" rel="L12384"></li>
<li class="L12385" rel="L12385">He was saying the affectionate word, however, with a far more grudging</li>
<li class="L12386" rel="L12386">condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative</li>
<li class="L12387" rel="L12387">merits and positions had been reversed (which is invariably the case,</li>
<li class="L12388" rel="L12388">all the world over), when Mr. Cruncher, touching him on the shoulder,</li>
<li class="L12389" rel="L12389">hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular</li>
<li class="L12390" rel="L12390">question:</li>
<li class="L12391" rel="L12391"></li>
<li class="L12392" rel="L12392">“I say! Might I ask the favour? As to whether your name is John Solomon,</li>
<li class="L12393" rel="L12393">or Solomon John?”</li>
<li class="L12394" rel="L12394"></li>
<li class="L12395" rel="L12395">The official turned towards him with sudden distrust. He had not</li>
<li class="L12396" rel="L12396">previously uttered a word.</li>
<li class="L12397" rel="L12397"></li>
<li class="L12398" rel="L12398">“Come!” said Mr. Cruncher. “Speak out, you know.” (Which, by the way,</li>
<li class="L12399" rel="L12399">was more than he could do himself.) “John Solomon, or Solomon John? She</li>
<li class="L12400" rel="L12400">calls you Solomon, and she must know, being your sister. And _I_ know</li>
<li class="L12401" rel="L12401">you&#39;re John, you know. Which of the two goes first? And regarding that</li>
<li class="L12402" rel="L12402">name of Pross, likewise. That warn&#39;t your name over the water.”</li>
<li class="L12403" rel="L12403"></li>
<li class="L12404" rel="L12404">“What do you mean?”</li>
<li class="L12405" rel="L12405"></li>
<li class="L12406" rel="L12406">“Well, I don&#39;t know all I mean, for I can&#39;t call to mind what your name</li>
<li class="L12407" rel="L12407">was, over the water.”</li>
<li class="L12408" rel="L12408"></li>
<li class="L12409" rel="L12409">“No?”</li>
<li class="L12410" rel="L12410"></li>
<li class="L12411" rel="L12411">“No. But I&#39;ll swear it was a name of two syllables.”</li>
<li class="L12412" rel="L12412"></li>
<li class="L12413" rel="L12413">“Indeed?”</li>
<li class="L12414" rel="L12414"></li>
<li class="L12415" rel="L12415">“Yes. T&#39;other one&#39;s was one syllable. I know you. You was a spy--witness</li>
<li class="L12416" rel="L12416">at the Bailey. What, in the name of the Father of Lies, own father to</li>
<li class="L12417" rel="L12417">yourself, was you called at that time?”</li>
<li class="L12418" rel="L12418"></li>
<li class="L12419" rel="L12419">“Barsad,” said another voice, striking in.</li>
<li class="L12420" rel="L12420"></li>
<li class="L12421" rel="L12421">“That&#39;s the name for a thousand pound!” cried Jerry.</li>
<li class="L12422" rel="L12422"></li>
<li class="L12423" rel="L12423">The speaker who struck in, was Sydney Carton. He had his hands behind</li>
<li class="L12424" rel="L12424">him under the skirts of his riding-coat, and he stood at Mr. Cruncher&#39;s</li>
<li class="L12425" rel="L12425">elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the Old Bailey itself.</li>
<li class="L12426" rel="L12426"></li>
<li class="L12427" rel="L12427">“Don&#39;t be alarmed, my dear Miss Pross. I arrived at Mr. Lorry&#39;s, to his</li>
<li class="L12428" rel="L12428">surprise, yesterday evening; we agreed that I would not present myself</li>
<li class="L12429" rel="L12429">elsewhere until all was well, or unless I could be useful; I present</li>
<li class="L12430" rel="L12430">myself here, to beg a little talk with your brother. I wish you had a</li>
<li class="L12431" rel="L12431">better employed brother than Mr. Barsad. I wish for your sake Mr. Barsad</li>
<li class="L12432" rel="L12432">was not a Sheep of the Prisons.”</li>
<li class="L12433" rel="L12433"></li>
<li class="L12434" rel="L12434">Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy, under the gaolers. The spy,</li>
<li class="L12435" rel="L12435">who was pale, turned paler, and asked him how he dared--</li>
<li class="L12436" rel="L12436"></li>
<li class="L12437" rel="L12437">“I&#39;ll tell you,” said Sydney. “I lighted on you, Mr. Barsad, coming out</li>
<li class="L12438" rel="L12438">of the prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the walls,</li>
<li class="L12439" rel="L12439">an hour or more ago. You have a face to be remembered, and I remember</li>
<li class="L12440" rel="L12440">faces well. Made curious by seeing you in that connection, and having</li>
<li class="L12441" rel="L12441">a reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you with</li>
<li class="L12442" rel="L12442">the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your</li>
<li class="L12443" rel="L12443">direction. I walked into the wine-shop here, close after you, and</li>
<li class="L12444" rel="L12444">sat near you. I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved</li>
<li class="L12445" rel="L12445">conversation, and the rumour openly going about among your admirers, the</li>
<li class="L12446" rel="L12446">nature of your calling. And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed</li>
<li class="L12447" rel="L12447">to shape itself into a purpose, Mr. Barsad.”</li>
<li class="L12448" rel="L12448"></li>
<li class="L12449" rel="L12449">“What purpose?” the spy asked.</li>
<li class="L12450" rel="L12450"></li>
<li class="L12451" rel="L12451">“It would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in the</li>
<li class="L12452" rel="L12452">street. Could you favour me, in confidence, with some minutes of your</li>
<li class="L12453" rel="L12453">company--at the office of Tellson&#39;s Bank, for instance?”</li>
<li class="L12454" rel="L12454"></li>
<li class="L12455" rel="L12455">“Under a threat?”</li>
<li class="L12456" rel="L12456"></li>
<li class="L12457" rel="L12457">“Oh! Did I say that?”</li>
<li class="L12458" rel="L12458"></li>
<li class="L12459" rel="L12459">“Then, why should I go there?”</li>
<li class="L12460" rel="L12460"></li>
<li class="L12461" rel="L12461">“Really, Mr. Barsad, I can&#39;t say, if you can&#39;t.”</li>
<li class="L12462" rel="L12462"></li>
<li class="L12463" rel="L12463">“Do you mean that you won&#39;t say, sir?” the spy irresolutely asked.</li>
<li class="L12464" rel="L12464"></li>
<li class="L12465" rel="L12465">“You apprehend me very clearly, Mr. Barsad. I won&#39;t.”</li>
<li class="L12466" rel="L12466"></li>
<li class="L12467" rel="L12467">Carton&#39;s negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his</li>
<li class="L12468" rel="L12468">quickness and skill, in such a business as he had in his secret mind,</li>
<li class="L12469" rel="L12469">and with such a man as he had to do with. His practised eye saw it, and</li>
<li class="L12470" rel="L12470">made the most of it.</li>
<li class="L12471" rel="L12471"></li>
<li class="L12472" rel="L12472">“Now, I told you so,” said the spy, casting a reproachful look at his</li>
<li class="L12473" rel="L12473">sister; “if any trouble comes of this, it&#39;s your doing.”</li>
<li class="L12474" rel="L12474"></li>
<li class="L12475" rel="L12475">“Come, come, Mr. Barsad!” exclaimed Sydney. “Don&#39;t be ungrateful.</li>
<li class="L12476" rel="L12476">But for my great respect for your sister, I might not have led up so</li>
<li class="L12477" rel="L12477">pleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual</li>
<li class="L12478" rel="L12478">satisfaction. Do you go with me to the Bank?”</li>
<li class="L12479" rel="L12479"></li>
<li class="L12480" rel="L12480">“I&#39;ll hear what you have got to say. Yes, I&#39;ll go with you.”</li>
<li class="L12481" rel="L12481"></li>
<li class="L12482" rel="L12482">“I propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her</li>
<li class="L12483" rel="L12483">own street. Let me take your arm, Miss Pross. This is not a good city,</li>
<li class="L12484" rel="L12484">at this time, for you to be out in, unprotected; and as your escort</li>
<li class="L12485" rel="L12485">knows Mr. Barsad, I will invite him to Mr. Lorry&#39;s with us. Are we</li>
<li class="L12486" rel="L12486">ready? Come then!”</li>
<li class="L12487" rel="L12487"></li>
<li class="L12488" rel="L12488">Miss Pross recalled soon afterwards, and to the end of her life</li>
<li class="L12489" rel="L12489">remembered, that as she pressed her hands on Sydney&#39;s arm and looked up</li>
<li class="L12490" rel="L12490">in his face, imploring him to do no hurt to Solomon, there was a braced</li>
<li class="L12491" rel="L12491">purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes, which not only</li>
<li class="L12492" rel="L12492">contradicted his light manner, but changed and raised the man. She was</li>
<li class="L12493" rel="L12493">too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved</li>
<li class="L12494" rel="L12494">her affection, and with Sydney&#39;s friendly reassurances, adequately to</li>
<li class="L12495" rel="L12495">heed what she observed.</li>
<li class="L12496" rel="L12496"></li>
<li class="L12497" rel="L12497">They left her at the corner of the street, and Carton led the way to Mr.</li>
<li class="L12498" rel="L12498">Lorry&#39;s, which was within a few minutes&#39; walk. John Barsad, or Solomon</li>
<li class="L12499" rel="L12499">Pross, walked at his side.</li>
<li class="L12500" rel="L12500"></li>
<li class="L12501" rel="L12501">Mr. Lorry had just finished his dinner, and was sitting before a cheery</li>
<li class="L12502" rel="L12502">little log or two of fire--perhaps looking into their blaze for the</li>
<li class="L12503" rel="L12503">picture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson&#39;s, who had looked</li>
<li class="L12504" rel="L12504">into the red coals at the Royal George at Dover, now a good many years</li>
<li class="L12505" rel="L12505">ago. He turned his head as they entered, and showed the surprise with</li>
<li class="L12506" rel="L12506">which he saw a stranger.</li>
<li class="L12507" rel="L12507"></li>
<li class="L12508" rel="L12508">“Miss Pross&#39;s brother, sir,” said Sydney. “Mr. Barsad.”</li>
<li class="L12509" rel="L12509"></li>
<li class="L12510" rel="L12510">“Barsad?” repeated the old gentleman, “Barsad? I have an association</li>
<li class="L12511" rel="L12511">with the name--and with the face.”</li>
<li class="L12512" rel="L12512"></li>
<li class="L12513" rel="L12513">“I told you you had a remarkable face, Mr. Barsad,” observed Carton,</li>
<li class="L12514" rel="L12514">coolly. “Pray sit down.”</li>
<li class="L12515" rel="L12515"></li>
<li class="L12516" rel="L12516">As he took a chair himself, he supplied the link that Mr. Lorry wanted,</li>
<li class="L12517" rel="L12517">by saying to him with a frown, “Witness at that trial.” Mr. Lorry</li>
<li class="L12518" rel="L12518">immediately remembered, and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised</li>
<li class="L12519" rel="L12519">look of abhorrence.</li>
<li class="L12520" rel="L12520"></li>
<li class="L12521" rel="L12521">“Mr. Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate</li>
<li class="L12522" rel="L12522">brother you have heard of,” said Sydney, “and has acknowledged the</li>
<li class="L12523" rel="L12523">relationship. I pass to worse news. Darnay has been arrested again.”</li>
<li class="L12524" rel="L12524"></li>
<li class="L12525" rel="L12525">Struck with consternation, the old gentleman exclaimed, “What do you</li>
<li class="L12526" rel="L12526">tell me! I left him safe and free within these two hours, and am about</li>
<li class="L12527" rel="L12527">to return to him!”</li>
<li class="L12528" rel="L12528"></li>
<li class="L12529" rel="L12529">“Arrested for all that. When was it done, Mr. Barsad?”</li>
<li class="L12530" rel="L12530"></li>
<li class="L12531" rel="L12531">“Just now, if at all.”</li>
<li class="L12532" rel="L12532"></li>
<li class="L12533" rel="L12533">“Mr. Barsad is the best authority possible, sir,” said Sydney, “and I</li>
<li class="L12534" rel="L12534">have it from Mr. Barsad&#39;s communication to a friend and brother Sheep</li>
<li class="L12535" rel="L12535">over a bottle of wine, that the arrest has taken place. He left the</li>
<li class="L12536" rel="L12536">messengers at the gate, and saw them admitted by the porter. There is no</li>
<li class="L12537" rel="L12537">earthly doubt that he is retaken.”</li>
<li class="L12538" rel="L12538"></li>
<li class="L12539" rel="L12539">Mr. Lorry&#39;s business eye read in the speaker&#39;s face that it was loss</li>
<li class="L12540" rel="L12540">of time to dwell upon the point. Confused, but sensible that something</li>
<li class="L12541" rel="L12541">might depend on his presence of mind, he commanded himself, and was</li>
<li class="L12542" rel="L12542">silently attentive.</li>
<li class="L12543" rel="L12543"></li>
<li class="L12544" rel="L12544">“Now, I trust,” said Sydney to him, “that the name and influence of</li>
<li class="L12545" rel="L12545">Doctor Manette may stand him in as good stead to-morrow--you said he</li>
<li class="L12546" rel="L12546">would be before the Tribunal again to-morrow, Mr. Barsad?--”</li>
<li class="L12547" rel="L12547"></li>
<li class="L12548" rel="L12548">“Yes; I believe so.”</li>
<li class="L12549" rel="L12549"></li>
<li class="L12550" rel="L12550">“--In as good stead to-morrow as to-day. But it may not be so. I own</li>
<li class="L12551" rel="L12551">to you, I am shaken, Mr. Lorry, by Doctor Manette&#39;s not having had the</li>
<li class="L12552" rel="L12552">power to prevent this arrest.”</li>
<li class="L12553" rel="L12553"></li>
<li class="L12554" rel="L12554">“He may not have known of it beforehand,” said Mr. Lorry.</li>
<li class="L12555" rel="L12555"></li>
<li class="L12556" rel="L12556">“But that very circumstance would be alarming, when we remember how</li>
<li class="L12557" rel="L12557">identified he is with his son-in-law.”</li>
<li class="L12558" rel="L12558"></li>
<li class="L12559" rel="L12559">“That&#39;s true,” Mr. Lorry acknowledged, with his troubled hand at his</li>
<li class="L12560" rel="L12560">chin, and his troubled eyes on Carton.</li>
<li class="L12561" rel="L12561"></li>
<li class="L12562" rel="L12562">“In short,” said Sydney, “this is a desperate time, when desperate games</li>
<li class="L12563" rel="L12563">are played for desperate stakes. Let the Doctor play the winning game; I</li>
<li class="L12564" rel="L12564">will play the losing one. No man&#39;s life here is worth purchase. Any one</li>
<li class="L12565" rel="L12565">carried home by the people to-day, may be condemned tomorrow. Now, the</li>
<li class="L12566" rel="L12566">stake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst, is a friend</li>
<li class="L12567" rel="L12567">in the Conciergerie. And the friend I purpose to myself to win, is Mr.</li>
<li class="L12568" rel="L12568">Barsad.”</li>
<li class="L12569" rel="L12569"></li>
<li class="L12570" rel="L12570">“You need have good cards, sir,” said the spy.</li>
<li class="L12571" rel="L12571"></li>
<li class="L12572" rel="L12572">“I&#39;ll run them over. I&#39;ll see what I hold,--Mr. Lorry, you know what a</li>
<li class="L12573" rel="L12573">brute I am; I wish you&#39;d give me a little brandy.”</li>
<li class="L12574" rel="L12574"></li>
<li class="L12575" rel="L12575">It was put before him, and he drank off a glassful--drank off another</li>
<li class="L12576" rel="L12576">glassful--pushed the bottle thoughtfully away.</li>
<li class="L12577" rel="L12577"></li>
<li class="L12578" rel="L12578">“Mr. Barsad,” he went on, in the tone of one who really was looking</li>
<li class="L12579" rel="L12579">over a hand at cards: “Sheep of the prisons, emissary of Republican</li>
<li class="L12580" rel="L12580">committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer,</li>
<li class="L12581" rel="L12581">so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman</li>
<li class="L12582" rel="L12582">is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a</li>
<li class="L12583" rel="L12583">Frenchman, represents himself to his employers under a false name.</li>
<li class="L12584" rel="L12584">That&#39;s a very good card. Mr. Barsad, now in the employ of the republican</li>
<li class="L12585" rel="L12585">French government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic</li>
<li class="L12586" rel="L12586">English government, the enemy of France and freedom. That&#39;s an excellent</li>
<li class="L12587" rel="L12587">card. Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr.</li>
<li class="L12588" rel="L12588">Barsad, still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the</li>
<li class="L12589" rel="L12589">spy of Pitt, the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom,</li>
<li class="L12590" rel="L12590">the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so</li>
<li class="L12591" rel="L12591">difficult to find. That&#39;s a card not to be beaten. Have you followed my</li>
<li class="L12592" rel="L12592">hand, Mr. Barsad?”</li>
<li class="L12593" rel="L12593"></li>
<li class="L12594" rel="L12594">“Not to understand your play,” returned the spy, somewhat uneasily.</li>
<li class="L12595" rel="L12595"></li>
<li class="L12596" rel="L12596">“I play my Ace, Denunciation of Mr. Barsad to the nearest Section</li>
<li class="L12597" rel="L12597">Committee. Look over your hand, Mr. Barsad, and see what you have. Don&#39;t</li>
<li class="L12598" rel="L12598">hurry.”</li>
<li class="L12599" rel="L12599"></li>
<li class="L12600" rel="L12600">He drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and</li>
<li class="L12601" rel="L12601">drank it off. He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself</li>
<li class="L12602" rel="L12602">into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him. Seeing it, he</li>
<li class="L12603" rel="L12603">poured out and drank another glassful.</li>
<li class="L12604" rel="L12604"></li>
<li class="L12605" rel="L12605">“Look over your hand carefully, Mr. Barsad. Take time.”</li>
<li class="L12606" rel="L12606"></li>
<li class="L12607" rel="L12607">It was a poorer hand than he suspected. Mr. Barsad saw losing cards</li>
<li class="L12608" rel="L12608">in it that Sydney Carton knew nothing of. Thrown out of his honourable</li>
<li class="L12609" rel="L12609">employment in England, through too much unsuccessful hard swearing</li>
<li class="L12610" rel="L12610">there--not because he was not wanted there; our English reasons for</li>
<li class="L12611" rel="L12611">vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern</li>
<li class="L12612" rel="L12612">date--he knew that he had crossed the Channel, and accepted service in</li>
<li class="L12613" rel="L12613">France: first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen</li>
<li class="L12614" rel="L12614">there: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives. He</li>
<li class="L12615" rel="L12615">knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon Saint</li>
<li class="L12616" rel="L12616">Antoine and Defarge&#39;s wine-shop; had received from the watchful police</li>
<li class="L12617" rel="L12617">such heads of information concerning Doctor Manette&#39;s imprisonment,</li>
<li class="L12618" rel="L12618">release, and history, as should serve him for an introduction to</li>
<li class="L12619" rel="L12619">familiar conversation with the Defarges; and tried them on Madame</li>
<li class="L12620" rel="L12620">Defarge, and had broken down with them signally. He always remembered</li>
<li class="L12621" rel="L12621">with fear and trembling, that that terrible woman had knitted when he</li>
<li class="L12622" rel="L12622">talked with her, and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved.</li>
<li class="L12623" rel="L12623">He had since seen her, in the Section of Saint Antoine, over and over</li>
<li class="L12624" rel="L12624">again produce her knitted registers, and denounce people whose lives the</li>
<li class="L12625" rel="L12625">guillotine then surely swallowed up. He knew, as every one employed as</li>
<li class="L12626" rel="L12626">he was did, that he was never safe; that flight was impossible; that</li>
<li class="L12627" rel="L12627">he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe; and that in spite of</li>
<li class="L12628" rel="L12628">his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning</li>
<li class="L12629" rel="L12629">terror, a word might bring it down upon him. Once denounced, and on such</li>
<li class="L12630" rel="L12630">grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind, he foresaw</li>
<li class="L12631" rel="L12631">that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many</li>
<li class="L12632" rel="L12632">proofs, would produce against him that fatal register, and would quash</li>
<li class="L12633" rel="L12633">his last chance of life. Besides that all secret men are men soon</li>
<li class="L12634" rel="L12634">terrified, here were surely cards enough of one black suit, to justify</li>
<li class="L12635" rel="L12635">the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over.</li>
<li class="L12636" rel="L12636"></li>
<li class="L12637" rel="L12637">“You scarcely seem to like your hand,” said Sydney, with the greatest</li>
<li class="L12638" rel="L12638">composure. “Do you play?”</li>
<li class="L12639" rel="L12639"></li>
<li class="L12640" rel="L12640">“I think, sir,” said the spy, in the meanest manner, as he turned to Mr.</li>
<li class="L12641" rel="L12641">Lorry, “I may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence, to</li>
<li class="L12642" rel="L12642">put it to this other gentleman, so much your junior, whether he can</li>
<li class="L12643" rel="L12643">under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that Ace</li>
<li class="L12644" rel="L12644">of which he has spoken. I admit that _I_ am a spy, and that it is</li>
<li class="L12645" rel="L12645">considered a discreditable station--though it must be filled by</li>
<li class="L12646" rel="L12646">somebody; but this gentleman is no spy, and why should he so demean</li>
<li class="L12647" rel="L12647">himself as to make himself one?”</li>
<li class="L12648" rel="L12648"></li>
<li class="L12649" rel="L12649">“I play my Ace, Mr. Barsad,” said Carton, taking the answer on himself,</li>
<li class="L12650" rel="L12650">and looking at his watch, “without any scruple, in a very few minutes.”</li>
<li class="L12651" rel="L12651"></li>
<li class="L12652" rel="L12652">“I should have hoped, gentlemen both,” said the spy, always striving to</li>
<li class="L12653" rel="L12653">hook Mr. Lorry into the discussion, “that your respect for my sister--”</li>
<li class="L12654" rel="L12654"></li>
<li class="L12655" rel="L12655">“I could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally</li>
<li class="L12656" rel="L12656">relieving her of her brother,” said Sydney Carton.</li>
<li class="L12657" rel="L12657"></li>
<li class="L12658" rel="L12658">“You think not, sir?”</li>
<li class="L12659" rel="L12659"></li>
<li class="L12660" rel="L12660">“I have thoroughly made up my mind about it.”</li>
<li class="L12661" rel="L12661"></li>
<li class="L12662" rel="L12662">The smooth manner of the spy, curiously in dissonance with his</li>
<li class="L12663" rel="L12663">ostentatiously rough dress, and probably with his usual demeanour,</li>
<li class="L12664" rel="L12664">received such a check from the inscrutability of Carton,--who was a</li>
<li class="L12665" rel="L12665">mystery to wiser and honester men than he,--that it faltered here and</li>
<li class="L12666" rel="L12666">failed him. While he was at a loss, Carton said, resuming his former air</li>
<li class="L12667" rel="L12667">of contemplating cards:</li>
<li class="L12668" rel="L12668"></li>
<li class="L12669" rel="L12669">“And indeed, now I think again, I have a strong impression that I</li>
<li class="L12670" rel="L12670">have another good card here, not yet enumerated. That friend and</li>
<li class="L12671" rel="L12671">fellow-Sheep, who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons;</li>
<li class="L12672" rel="L12672">who was he?”</li>
<li class="L12673" rel="L12673"></li>
<li class="L12674" rel="L12674">“French. You don&#39;t know him,” said the spy, quickly.</li>
<li class="L12675" rel="L12675"></li>
<li class="L12676" rel="L12676">“French, eh?” repeated Carton, musing, and not appearing to notice him</li>
<li class="L12677" rel="L12677">at all, though he echoed his word. “Well; he may be.”</li>
<li class="L12678" rel="L12678"></li>
<li class="L12679" rel="L12679">“Is, I assure you,” said the spy; “though it&#39;s not important.”</li>
<li class="L12680" rel="L12680"></li>
<li class="L12681" rel="L12681">“Though it&#39;s not important,” repeated Carton, in the same mechanical</li>
<li class="L12682" rel="L12682">way--“though it&#39;s not important--No, it&#39;s not important. No. Yet I know</li>
<li class="L12683" rel="L12683">the face.”</li>
<li class="L12684" rel="L12684"></li>
<li class="L12685" rel="L12685">“I think not. I am sure not. It can&#39;t be,” said the spy.</li>
<li class="L12686" rel="L12686"></li>
<li class="L12687" rel="L12687">“It-can&#39;t-be,” muttered Sydney Carton, retrospectively, and idling his</li>
<li class="L12688" rel="L12688">glass (which fortunately was a small one) again. “Can&#39;t-be. Spoke good</li>
<li class="L12689" rel="L12689">French. Yet like a foreigner, I thought?”</li>
<li class="L12690" rel="L12690"></li>
<li class="L12691" rel="L12691">“Provincial,” said the spy.</li>
<li class="L12692" rel="L12692"></li>
<li class="L12693" rel="L12693">“No. Foreign!” cried Carton, striking his open hand on the table, as a</li>
<li class="L12694" rel="L12694">light broke clearly on his mind. “Cly! Disguised, but the same man. We</li>
<li class="L12695" rel="L12695">had that man before us at the Old Bailey.”</li>
<li class="L12696" rel="L12696"></li>
<li class="L12697" rel="L12697">“Now, there you are hasty, sir,” said Barsad, with a smile that gave his</li>
<li class="L12698" rel="L12698">aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side; “there you really give</li>
<li class="L12699" rel="L12699">me an advantage over you. Cly (who I will unreservedly admit, at this</li>
<li class="L12700" rel="L12700">distance of time, was a partner of mine) has been dead several years. I</li>
<li class="L12701" rel="L12701">attended him in his last illness. He was buried in London, at the church</li>
<li class="L12702" rel="L12702">of Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields. His unpopularity with the blackguard</li>
<li class="L12703" rel="L12703">multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains, but I helped</li>
<li class="L12704" rel="L12704">to lay him in his coffin.”</li>
<li class="L12705" rel="L12705"></li>
<li class="L12706" rel="L12706">Here, Mr. Lorry became aware, from where he sat, of a most remarkable</li>
<li class="L12707" rel="L12707">goblin shadow on the wall. Tracing it to its source, he discovered it</li>
<li class="L12708" rel="L12708">to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the</li>
<li class="L12709" rel="L12709">risen and stiff hair on Mr. Cruncher&#39;s head.</li>
<li class="L12710" rel="L12710"></li>
<li class="L12711" rel="L12711">“Let us be reasonable,” said the spy, “and let us be fair. To show you</li>
<li class="L12712" rel="L12712">how mistaken you are, and what an unfounded assumption yours is, I will</li>
<li class="L12713" rel="L12713">lay before you a certificate of Cly&#39;s burial, which I happened to have</li>
<li class="L12714" rel="L12714">carried in my pocket-book,” with a hurried hand he produced and opened</li>
<li class="L12715" rel="L12715">it, “ever since. There it is. Oh, look at it, look at it! You may take</li>
<li class="L12716" rel="L12716">it in your hand; it&#39;s no forgery.”</li>
<li class="L12717" rel="L12717"></li>
<li class="L12718" rel="L12718">Here, Mr. Lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate, and</li>
<li class="L12719" rel="L12719">Mr. Cruncher rose and stepped forward. His hair could not have been more</li>
<li class="L12720" rel="L12720">violently on end, if it had been that moment dressed by the Cow with the</li>
<li class="L12721" rel="L12721">crumpled horn in the house that Jack built.</li>
<li class="L12722" rel="L12722"></li>
<li class="L12723" rel="L12723">Unseen by the spy, Mr. Cruncher stood at his side, and touched him on</li>
<li class="L12724" rel="L12724">the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff.</li>
<li class="L12725" rel="L12725"></li>
<li class="L12726" rel="L12726">“That there Roger Cly, master,” said Mr. Cruncher, with a taciturn and</li>
<li class="L12727" rel="L12727">iron-bound visage. “So _you_ put him in his coffin?”</li>
<li class="L12728" rel="L12728"></li>
<li class="L12729" rel="L12729">“I did.”</li>
<li class="L12730" rel="L12730"></li>
<li class="L12731" rel="L12731">“Who took him out of it?”</li>
<li class="L12732" rel="L12732"></li>
<li class="L12733" rel="L12733">Barsad leaned back in his chair, and stammered, “What do you mean?”</li>
<li class="L12734" rel="L12734"></li>
<li class="L12735" rel="L12735">“I mean,” said Mr. Cruncher, “that he warn&#39;t never in it. No! Not he!</li>
<li class="L12736" rel="L12736">I&#39;ll have my head took off, if he was ever in it.”</li>
<li class="L12737" rel="L12737"></li>
<li class="L12738" rel="L12738">The spy looked round at the two gentlemen; they both looked in</li>
<li class="L12739" rel="L12739">unspeakable astonishment at Jerry.</li>
<li class="L12740" rel="L12740"></li>
<li class="L12741" rel="L12741">“I tell you,” said Jerry, “that you buried paving-stones and earth in</li>
<li class="L12742" rel="L12742">that there coffin. Don&#39;t go and tell me that you buried Cly. It was a</li>
<li class="L12743" rel="L12743">take in. Me and two more knows it.”</li>
<li class="L12744" rel="L12744"></li>
<li class="L12745" rel="L12745">“How do you know it?”</li>
<li class="L12746" rel="L12746"></li>
<li class="L12747" rel="L12747">“What&#39;s that to you? Ecod!” growled Mr. Cruncher, “it&#39;s you I have got a</li>
<li class="L12748" rel="L12748">old grudge again, is it, with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen!</li>
<li class="L12749" rel="L12749">I&#39;d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea.”</li>
<li class="L12750" rel="L12750"></li>
<li class="L12751" rel="L12751">Sydney Carton, who, with Mr. Lorry, had been lost in amazement at</li>
<li class="L12752" rel="L12752">this turn of the business, here requested Mr. Cruncher to moderate and</li>
<li class="L12753" rel="L12753">explain himself.</li>
<li class="L12754" rel="L12754"></li>
<li class="L12755" rel="L12755">“At another time, sir,” he returned, evasively, “the present time is</li>
<li class="L12756" rel="L12756">ill-conwenient for explainin&#39;. What I stand to, is, that he knows well</li>
<li class="L12757" rel="L12757">wot that there Cly was never in that there coffin. Let him say he was,</li>
<li class="L12758" rel="L12758">in so much as a word of one syllable, and I&#39;ll either catch hold of his</li>
<li class="L12759" rel="L12759">throat and choke him for half a guinea;” Mr. Cruncher dwelt upon this as</li>
<li class="L12760" rel="L12760">quite a liberal offer; “or I&#39;ll out and announce him.”</li>
<li class="L12761" rel="L12761"></li>
<li class="L12762" rel="L12762">“Humph! I see one thing,” said Carton. “I hold another card, Mr. Barsad.</li>
<li class="L12763" rel="L12763">Impossible, here in raging Paris, with Suspicion filling the air, for</li>
<li class="L12764" rel="L12764">you to outlive denunciation, when you are in communication with another</li>
<li class="L12765" rel="L12765">aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself, who, moreover, has</li>
<li class="L12766" rel="L12766">the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again!</li>
<li class="L12767" rel="L12767">A plot in the prisons, of the foreigner against the Republic. A strong</li>
<li class="L12768" rel="L12768">card--a certain Guillotine card! Do you play?”</li>
<li class="L12769" rel="L12769"></li>
<li class="L12770" rel="L12770">“No!” returned the spy. “I throw up. I confess that we were so unpopular</li>
<li class="L12771" rel="L12771">with the outrageous mob, that I only got away from England at the risk</li>
<li class="L12772" rel="L12772">of being ducked to death, and that Cly was so ferreted up and down, that</li>
<li class="L12773" rel="L12773">he never would have got away at all but for that sham. Though how this</li>
<li class="L12774" rel="L12774">man knows it was a sham, is a wonder of wonders to me.”</li>
<li class="L12775" rel="L12775"></li>
<li class="L12776" rel="L12776">“Never you trouble your head about this man,” retorted the contentious</li>
<li class="L12777" rel="L12777">Mr. Cruncher; “you&#39;ll have trouble enough with giving your attention to</li>
<li class="L12778" rel="L12778">that gentleman. And look here! Once more!”--Mr. Cruncher could not</li>
<li class="L12779" rel="L12779">be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his</li>
<li class="L12780" rel="L12780">liberality--“I&#39;d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a</li>
<li class="L12781" rel="L12781">guinea.”</li>
<li class="L12782" rel="L12782"></li>
<li class="L12783" rel="L12783">The Sheep of the prisons turned from him to Sydney Carton, and said,</li>
<li class="L12784" rel="L12784">with more decision, “It has come to a point. I go on duty soon, and</li>
<li class="L12785" rel="L12785">can&#39;t overstay my time. You told me you had a proposal; what is it?</li>
<li class="L12786" rel="L12786">Now, it is of no use asking too much of me. Ask me to do anything in my</li>
<li class="L12787" rel="L12787">office, putting my head in great extra danger, and I had better trust my</li>
<li class="L12788" rel="L12788">life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent. In short,</li>
<li class="L12789" rel="L12789">I should make that choice. You talk of desperation. We are all desperate</li>
<li class="L12790" rel="L12790">here. Remember! I may denounce you if I think proper, and I can swear my</li>
<li class="L12791" rel="L12791">way through stone walls, and so can others. Now, what do you want with</li>
<li class="L12792" rel="L12792">me?”</li>
<li class="L12793" rel="L12793"></li>
<li class="L12794" rel="L12794">“Not very much. You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie?”</li>
<li class="L12795" rel="L12795"></li>
<li class="L12796" rel="L12796">“I tell you once for all, there is no such thing as an escape possible,”</li>
<li class="L12797" rel="L12797"> said the spy, firmly.</li>
<li class="L12798" rel="L12798"></li>
<li class="L12799" rel="L12799">“Why need you tell me what I have not asked? You are a turnkey at the</li>
<li class="L12800" rel="L12800">Conciergerie?”</li>
<li class="L12801" rel="L12801"></li>
<li class="L12802" rel="L12802">“I am sometimes.”</li>
<li class="L12803" rel="L12803"></li>
<li class="L12804" rel="L12804">“You can be when you choose?”</li>
<li class="L12805" rel="L12805"></li>
<li class="L12806" rel="L12806">“I can pass in and out when I choose.”</li>
<li class="L12807" rel="L12807"></li>
<li class="L12808" rel="L12808">Sydney Carton filled another glass with brandy, poured it slowly out</li>
<li class="L12809" rel="L12809">upon the hearth, and watched it as it dropped. It being all spent, he</li>
<li class="L12810" rel="L12810">said, rising:</li>
<li class="L12811" rel="L12811"></li>
<li class="L12812" rel="L12812">“So far, we have spoken before these two, because it was as well that</li>
<li class="L12813" rel="L12813">the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me. Come</li>
<li class="L12814" rel="L12814">into the dark room here, and let us have one final word alone.”</li>
<li class="L12815" rel="L12815"></li>
<li class="L12816" rel="L12816"></li>
<li class="L12817" rel="L12817"></li>
<li class="L12818" rel="L12818"></li>
<li class="L12819" rel="L12819">IX. The Game Made</li>
<li class="L12820" rel="L12820"></li>
<li class="L12821" rel="L12821"></li>
<li class="L12822" rel="L12822">While Sydney Carton and the Sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining</li>
<li class="L12823" rel="L12823">dark room, speaking so low that not a sound was heard, Mr. Lorry looked</li>
<li class="L12824" rel="L12824">at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust. That honest tradesman&#39;s</li>
<li class="L12825" rel="L12825">manner of receiving the look, did not inspire confidence; he changed the</li>
<li class="L12826" rel="L12826">leg on which he rested, as often as if he had fifty of those limbs,</li>
<li class="L12827" rel="L12827">and were trying them all; he examined his finger-nails with a very</li>
<li class="L12828" rel="L12828">questionable closeness of attention; and whenever Mr. Lorry&#39;s eye caught</li>
<li class="L12829" rel="L12829">his, he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the</li>
<li class="L12830" rel="L12830">hollow of a hand before it, which is seldom, if ever, known to be an</li>
<li class="L12831" rel="L12831">infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character.</li>
<li class="L12832" rel="L12832"></li>
<li class="L12833" rel="L12833">“Jerry,” said Mr. Lorry. “Come here.”</li>
<li class="L12834" rel="L12834"></li>
<li class="L12835" rel="L12835">Mr. Cruncher came forward sideways, with one of his shoulders in advance</li>
<li class="L12836" rel="L12836">of him.</li>
<li class="L12837" rel="L12837"></li>
<li class="L12838" rel="L12838">“What have you been, besides a messenger?”</li>
<li class="L12839" rel="L12839"></li>
<li class="L12840" rel="L12840">After some cogitation, accompanied with an intent look at his patron,</li>
<li class="L12841" rel="L12841">Mr. Cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying, “Agicultooral</li>
<li class="L12842" rel="L12842">character.”</li>
<li class="L12843" rel="L12843"></li>
<li class="L12844" rel="L12844">“My mind misgives me much,” said Mr. Lorry, angrily shaking a forefinger</li>
<li class="L12845" rel="L12845">at him, “that you have used the respectable and great house of Tellson&#39;s</li>
<li class="L12846" rel="L12846">as a blind, and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous</li>
<li class="L12847" rel="L12847">description. If you have, don&#39;t expect me to befriend you when you</li>
<li class="L12848" rel="L12848">get back to England. If you have, don&#39;t expect me to keep your secret.</li>
<li class="L12849" rel="L12849">Tellson&#39;s shall not be imposed upon.”</li>
<li class="L12850" rel="L12850"></li>
<li class="L12851" rel="L12851">“I hope, sir,” pleaded the abashed Mr. Cruncher, “that a gentleman like</li>
<li class="L12852" rel="L12852">yourself wot I&#39;ve had the honour of odd jobbing till I&#39;m grey at it,</li>
<li class="L12853" rel="L12853">would think twice about harming of me, even if it wos so--I don&#39;t say it</li>
<li class="L12854" rel="L12854">is, but even if it wos. And which it is to be took into account that if</li>
<li class="L12855" rel="L12855">it wos, it wouldn&#39;t, even then, be all o&#39; one side. There&#39;d be two sides</li>
<li class="L12856" rel="L12856">to it. There might be medical doctors at the present hour, a picking</li>
<li class="L12857" rel="L12857">up their guineas where a honest tradesman don&#39;t pick up his</li>
<li class="L12858" rel="L12858">fardens--fardens! no, nor yet his half fardens--half fardens! no, nor</li>
<li class="L12859" rel="L12859">yet his quarter--a banking away like smoke at Tellson&#39;s, and a cocking</li>
<li class="L12860" rel="L12860">their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly, a going in and going</li>
<li class="L12861" rel="L12861">out to their own carriages--ah! equally like smoke, if not more so.</li>
<li class="L12862" rel="L12862">Well, that &#39;ud be imposing, too, on Tellson&#39;s. For you cannot sarse the</li>
<li class="L12863" rel="L12863">goose and not the gander. And here&#39;s Mrs. Cruncher, or leastways wos</li>
<li class="L12864" rel="L12864">in the Old England times, and would be to-morrow, if cause given,</li>
<li class="L12865" rel="L12865">a floppin&#39; again the business to that degree as is ruinating--stark</li>
<li class="L12866" rel="L12866">ruinating! Whereas them medical doctors&#39; wives don&#39;t flop--catch &#39;em at</li>
<li class="L12867" rel="L12867">it! Or, if they flop, their floppings goes in favour of more patients,</li>
<li class="L12868" rel="L12868">and how can you rightly have one without t&#39;other? Then, wot with</li>
<li class="L12869" rel="L12869">undertakers, and wot with parish clerks, and wot with sextons, and wot</li>
<li class="L12870" rel="L12870">with private watchmen (all awaricious and all in it), a man wouldn&#39;t get</li>
<li class="L12871" rel="L12871">much by it, even if it wos so. And wot little a man did get, would never</li>
<li class="L12872" rel="L12872">prosper with him, Mr. Lorry. He&#39;d never have no good of it; he&#39;d want</li>
<li class="L12873" rel="L12873">all along to be out of the line, if he, could see his way out, being</li>
<li class="L12874" rel="L12874">once in--even if it wos so.”</li>
<li class="L12875" rel="L12875"></li>
<li class="L12876" rel="L12876">“Ugh!” cried Mr. Lorry, rather relenting, nevertheless, “I am shocked at</li>
<li class="L12877" rel="L12877">the sight of you.”</li>
<li class="L12878" rel="L12878"></li>
<li class="L12879" rel="L12879">“Now, what I would humbly offer to you, sir,” pursued Mr. Cruncher,</li>
<li class="L12880" rel="L12880">“even if it wos so, which I don&#39;t say it is--”</li>
<li class="L12881" rel="L12881"></li>
<li class="L12882" rel="L12882">“Don&#39;t prevaricate,” said Mr. Lorry.</li>
<li class="L12883" rel="L12883"></li>
<li class="L12884" rel="L12884">“No, I will _not_, sir,” returned Mr. Crunches as if nothing were</li>
<li class="L12885" rel="L12885">further from his thoughts or practice--“which I don&#39;t say it is--wot I</li>
<li class="L12886" rel="L12886">would humbly offer to you, sir, would be this. Upon that there stool, at</li>
<li class="L12887" rel="L12887">that there Bar, sets that there boy of mine, brought up and growed up to</li>
<li class="L12888" rel="L12888">be a man, wot will errand you, message you, general-light-job you, till</li>
<li class="L12889" rel="L12889">your heels is where your head is, if such should be your wishes. If it</li>
<li class="L12890" rel="L12890">wos so, which I still don&#39;t say it is (for I will not prewaricate to</li>
<li class="L12891" rel="L12891">you, sir), let that there boy keep his father&#39;s place, and take care of</li>
<li class="L12892" rel="L12892">his mother; don&#39;t blow upon that boy&#39;s father--do not do it, sir--and</li>
<li class="L12893" rel="L12893">let that father go into the line of the reg&#39;lar diggin&#39;, and make amends</li>
<li class="L12894" rel="L12894">for what he would have undug--if it wos so--by diggin&#39; of &#39;em in with</li>
<li class="L12895" rel="L12895">a will, and with conwictions respectin&#39; the futur&#39; keepin&#39; of &#39;em safe.</li>
<li class="L12896" rel="L12896">That, Mr. Lorry,” said Mr. Cruncher, wiping his forehead with his</li>
<li class="L12897" rel="L12897">arm, as an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his</li>
<li class="L12898" rel="L12898">discourse, “is wot I would respectfully offer to you, sir. A man don&#39;t</li>
<li class="L12899" rel="L12899">see all this here a goin&#39; on dreadful round him, in the way of Subjects</li>
<li class="L12900" rel="L12900">without heads, dear me, plentiful enough fur to bring the price down</li>
<li class="L12901" rel="L12901">to porterage and hardly that, without havin&#39; his serious thoughts of</li>
<li class="L12902" rel="L12902">things. And these here would be mine, if it wos so, entreatin&#39; of you</li>
<li class="L12903" rel="L12903">fur to bear in mind that wot I said just now, I up and said in the good</li>
<li class="L12904" rel="L12904">cause when I might have kep&#39; it back.”</li>
<li class="L12905" rel="L12905"></li>
<li class="L12906" rel="L12906">“That at least is true,” said Mr. Lorry. “Say no more now. It may be</li>
<li class="L12907" rel="L12907">that I shall yet stand your friend, if you deserve it, and repent in</li>
<li class="L12908" rel="L12908">action--not in words. I want no more words.”</li>
<li class="L12909" rel="L12909"></li>
<li class="L12910" rel="L12910">Mr. Cruncher knuckled his forehead, as Sydney Carton and the spy</li>
<li class="L12911" rel="L12911">returned from the dark room. “Adieu, Mr. Barsad,” said the former; “our</li>
<li class="L12912" rel="L12912">arrangement thus made, you have nothing to fear from me.”</li>
<li class="L12913" rel="L12913"></li>
<li class="L12914" rel="L12914">He sat down in a chair on the hearth, over against Mr. Lorry. When they</li>
<li class="L12915" rel="L12915">were alone, Mr. Lorry asked him what he had done?</li>
<li class="L12916" rel="L12916"></li>
<li class="L12917" rel="L12917">“Not much. If it should go ill with the prisoner, I have ensured access</li>
<li class="L12918" rel="L12918">to him, once.”</li>
<li class="L12919" rel="L12919"></li>
<li class="L12920" rel="L12920">Mr. Lorry&#39;s countenance fell.</li>
<li class="L12921" rel="L12921"></li>
<li class="L12922" rel="L12922">“It is all I could do,” said Carton. “To propose too much, would be</li>
<li class="L12923" rel="L12923">to put this man&#39;s head under the axe, and, as he himself said, nothing</li>
<li class="L12924" rel="L12924">worse could happen to him if he were denounced. It was obviously the</li>
<li class="L12925" rel="L12925">weakness of the position. There is no help for it.”</li>
<li class="L12926" rel="L12926"></li>
<li class="L12927" rel="L12927">“But access to him,” said Mr. Lorry, “if it should go ill before the</li>
<li class="L12928" rel="L12928">Tribunal, will not save him.”</li>
<li class="L12929" rel="L12929"></li>
<li class="L12930" rel="L12930">“I never said it would.”</li>
<li class="L12931" rel="L12931"></li>
<li class="L12932" rel="L12932">Mr. Lorry&#39;s eyes gradually sought the fire; his sympathy with his</li>
<li class="L12933" rel="L12933">darling, and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest, gradually</li>
<li class="L12934" rel="L12934">weakened them; he was an old man now, overborne with anxiety of late,</li>
<li class="L12935" rel="L12935">and his tears fell.</li>
<li class="L12936" rel="L12936"></li>
<li class="L12937" rel="L12937">“You are a good man and a true friend,” said Carton, in an altered</li>
<li class="L12938" rel="L12938">voice. “Forgive me if I notice that you are affected. I could not see my</li>
<li class="L12939" rel="L12939">father weep, and sit by, careless. And I could not respect your</li>
<li class="L12940" rel="L12940">sorrow more, if you were my father. You are free from that misfortune,</li>
<li class="L12941" rel="L12941">however.”</li>
<li class="L12942" rel="L12942"></li>
<li class="L12943" rel="L12943">Though he said the last words, with a slip into his usual manner, there</li>
<li class="L12944" rel="L12944">was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch,</li>
<li class="L12945" rel="L12945">that Mr. Lorry, who had never seen the better side of him, was wholly</li>
<li class="L12946" rel="L12946">unprepared for. He gave him his hand, and Carton gently pressed it.</li>
<li class="L12947" rel="L12947"></li>
<li class="L12948" rel="L12948">“To return to poor Darnay,” said Carton. “Don&#39;t tell Her of this</li>
<li class="L12949" rel="L12949">interview, or this arrangement. It would not enable Her to go to see</li>
<li class="L12950" rel="L12950">him. She might think it was contrived, in case of the worse, to convey</li>
<li class="L12951" rel="L12951">to him the means of anticipating the sentence.”</li>
<li class="L12952" rel="L12952"></li>
<li class="L12953" rel="L12953">Mr. Lorry had not thought of that, and he looked quickly at Carton to</li>
<li class="L12954" rel="L12954">see if it were in his mind. It seemed to be; he returned the look, and</li>
<li class="L12955" rel="L12955">evidently understood it.</li>
<li class="L12956" rel="L12956"></li>
<li class="L12957" rel="L12957">“She might think a thousand things,” Carton said, “and any of them would</li>
<li class="L12958" rel="L12958">only add to her trouble. Don&#39;t speak of me to her. As I said to you when</li>
<li class="L12959" rel="L12959">I first came, I had better not see her. I can put my hand out, to do any</li>
<li class="L12960" rel="L12960">little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do, without that.</li>
<li class="L12961" rel="L12961">You are going to her, I hope? She must be very desolate to-night.”</li>
<li class="L12962" rel="L12962"></li>
<li class="L12963" rel="L12963">“I am going now, directly.”</li>
<li class="L12964" rel="L12964"></li>
<li class="L12965" rel="L12965">“I am glad of that. She has such a strong attachment to you and reliance</li>
<li class="L12966" rel="L12966">on you. How does she look?”</li>
<li class="L12967" rel="L12967"></li>
<li class="L12968" rel="L12968">“Anxious and unhappy, but very beautiful.”</li>
<li class="L12969" rel="L12969"></li>
<li class="L12970" rel="L12970">“Ah!”</li>
<li class="L12971" rel="L12971"></li>
<li class="L12972" rel="L12972">It was a long, grieving sound, like a sigh--almost like a sob. It</li>
<li class="L12973" rel="L12973">attracted Mr. Lorry&#39;s eyes to Carton&#39;s face, which was turned to the</li>
<li class="L12974" rel="L12974">fire. A light, or a shade (the old gentleman could not have said which),</li>
<li class="L12975" rel="L12975">passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill-side on a</li>
<li class="L12976" rel="L12976">wild bright day, and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little</li>
<li class="L12977" rel="L12977">flaming logs, which was tumbling forward. He wore the white riding-coat</li>
<li class="L12978" rel="L12978">and top-boots, then in vogue, and the light of the fire touching their</li>
<li class="L12979" rel="L12979">light surfaces made him look very pale, with his long brown hair,</li>
<li class="L12980" rel="L12980">all untrimmed, hanging loose about him. His indifference to fire was</li>
<li class="L12981" rel="L12981">sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from Mr. Lorry;</li>
<li class="L12982" rel="L12982">his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log, when it had</li>
<li class="L12983" rel="L12983">broken under the weight of his foot.</li>
<li class="L12984" rel="L12984"></li>
<li class="L12985" rel="L12985">“I forgot it,” he said.</li>
<li class="L12986" rel="L12986"></li>
<li class="L12987" rel="L12987">Mr. Lorry&#39;s eyes were again attracted to his face. Taking note of the</li>
<li class="L12988" rel="L12988">wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features, and having</li>
<li class="L12989" rel="L12989">the expression of prisoners&#39; faces fresh in his mind, he was strongly</li>
<li class="L12990" rel="L12990">reminded of that expression.</li>
<li class="L12991" rel="L12991"></li>
<li class="L12992" rel="L12992">“And your duties here have drawn to an end, sir?” said Carton, turning</li>
<li class="L12993" rel="L12993">to him.</li>
<li class="L12994" rel="L12994"></li>
<li class="L12995" rel="L12995">“Yes. As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so</li>
<li class="L12996" rel="L12996">unexpectedly, I have at length done all that I can do here. I hoped to</li>
<li class="L12997" rel="L12997">have left them in perfect safety, and then to have quitted Paris. I have</li>
<li class="L12998" rel="L12998">my Leave to Pass. I was ready to go.”</li>
<li class="L12999" rel="L12999"></li>
<li class="L13000" rel="L13000">They were both silent.</li>
<li class="L13001" rel="L13001"></li>
<li class="L13002" rel="L13002">“Yours is a long life to look back upon, sir?” said Carton, wistfully.</li>
<li class="L13003" rel="L13003"></li>
<li class="L13004" rel="L13004">“I am in my seventy-eighth year.”</li>
<li class="L13005" rel="L13005"></li>
<li class="L13006" rel="L13006">“You have been useful all your life; steadily and constantly occupied;</li>
<li class="L13007" rel="L13007">trusted, respected, and looked up to?”</li>
<li class="L13008" rel="L13008"></li>
<li class="L13009" rel="L13009">“I have been a man of business, ever since I have been a man. Indeed, I</li>
<li class="L13010" rel="L13010">may say that I was a man of business when a boy.”</li>
<li class="L13011" rel="L13011"></li>
<li class="L13012" rel="L13012">“See what a place you fill at seventy-eight. How many people will miss</li>
<li class="L13013" rel="L13013">you when you leave it empty!”</li>
<li class="L13014" rel="L13014"></li>
<li class="L13015" rel="L13015">“A solitary old bachelor,” answered Mr. Lorry, shaking his head. “There</li>
<li class="L13016" rel="L13016">is nobody to weep for me.”</li>
<li class="L13017" rel="L13017"></li>
<li class="L13018" rel="L13018">“How can you say that? Wouldn&#39;t She weep for you? Wouldn&#39;t her child?”</li>
<li class="L13019" rel="L13019"></li>
<li class="L13020" rel="L13020">“Yes, yes, thank God. I didn&#39;t quite mean what I said.”</li>
<li class="L13021" rel="L13021"></li>
<li class="L13022" rel="L13022">“It _is_ a thing to thank God for; is it not?”</li>
<li class="L13023" rel="L13023"></li>
<li class="L13024" rel="L13024">“Surely, surely.”</li>
<li class="L13025" rel="L13025"></li>
<li class="L13026" rel="L13026">“If you could say, with truth, to your own solitary heart, to-night,</li>
<li class="L13027" rel="L13027">&#39;I have secured to myself the love and attachment, the gratitude or</li>
<li class="L13028" rel="L13028">respect, of no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in no</li>
<li class="L13029" rel="L13029">regard; I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by!&#39;</li>
<li class="L13030" rel="L13030">your seventy-eight years would be seventy-eight heavy curses; would they</li>
<li class="L13031" rel="L13031">not?”</li>
<li class="L13032" rel="L13032"></li>
<li class="L13033" rel="L13033">“You say truly, Mr. Carton; I think they would be.”</li>
<li class="L13034" rel="L13034"></li>
<li class="L13035" rel="L13035">Sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire, and, after a silence of a</li>
<li class="L13036" rel="L13036">few moments, said:</li>
<li class="L13037" rel="L13037"></li>
<li class="L13038" rel="L13038">“I should like to ask you:--Does your childhood seem far off? Do the</li>
<li class="L13039" rel="L13039">days when you sat at your mother&#39;s knee, seem days of very long ago?”</li>
<li class="L13040" rel="L13040"></li>
<li class="L13041" rel="L13041">Responding to his softened manner, Mr. Lorry answered:</li>
<li class="L13042" rel="L13042"></li>
<li class="L13043" rel="L13043">“Twenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no. For, as I draw</li>
<li class="L13044" rel="L13044">closer and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and</li>
<li class="L13045" rel="L13045">nearer to the beginning. It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and</li>
<li class="L13046" rel="L13046">preparings of the way. My heart is touched now, by many remembrances</li>
<li class="L13047" rel="L13047">that had long fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother (and I so old!),</li>
<li class="L13048" rel="L13048">and by many associations of the days when what we call the World was not</li>
<li class="L13049" rel="L13049">so real with me, and my faults were not confirmed in me.”</li>
<li class="L13050" rel="L13050"></li>
<li class="L13051" rel="L13051">“I understand the feeling!” exclaimed Carton, with a bright flush. “And</li>
<li class="L13052" rel="L13052">you are the better for it?”</li>
<li class="L13053" rel="L13053"></li>
<li class="L13054" rel="L13054">“I hope so.”</li>
<li class="L13055" rel="L13055"></li>
<li class="L13056" rel="L13056">Carton terminated the conversation here, by rising to help him on with</li>
<li class="L13057" rel="L13057">his outer coat; “But you,” said Mr. Lorry, reverting to the theme, “you</li>
<li class="L13058" rel="L13058">are young.”</li>
<li class="L13059" rel="L13059"></li>
<li class="L13060" rel="L13060">“Yes,” said Carton. “I am not old, but my young way was never the way to</li>
<li class="L13061" rel="L13061">age. Enough of me.”</li>
<li class="L13062" rel="L13062"></li>
<li class="L13063" rel="L13063">“And of me, I am sure,” said Mr. Lorry. “Are you going out?”</li>
<li class="L13064" rel="L13064"></li>
<li class="L13065" rel="L13065">“I&#39;ll walk with you to her gate. You know my vagabond and restless</li>
<li class="L13066" rel="L13066">habits. If I should prowl about the streets a long time, don&#39;t be</li>
<li class="L13067" rel="L13067">uneasy; I shall reappear in the morning. You go to the Court to-morrow?”</li>
<li class="L13068" rel="L13068"></li>
<li class="L13069" rel="L13069">“Yes, unhappily.”</li>
<li class="L13070" rel="L13070"></li>
<li class="L13071" rel="L13071">“I shall be there, but only as one of the crowd. My Spy will find a</li>
<li class="L13072" rel="L13072">place for me. Take my arm, sir.”</li>
<li class="L13073" rel="L13073"></li>
<li class="L13074" rel="L13074">Mr. Lorry did so, and they went down-stairs and out in the streets. A</li>
<li class="L13075" rel="L13075">few minutes brought them to Mr. Lorry&#39;s destination. Carton left him</li>
<li class="L13076" rel="L13076">there; but lingered at a little distance, and turned back to the gate</li>
<li class="L13077" rel="L13077">again when it was shut, and touched it. He had heard of her going to</li>
<li class="L13078" rel="L13078">the prison every day. “She came out here,” he said, looking about him,</li>
<li class="L13079" rel="L13079">“turned this way, must have trod on these stones often. Let me follow in</li>
<li class="L13080" rel="L13080">her steps.”</li>
<li class="L13081" rel="L13081"></li>
<li class="L13082" rel="L13082">It was ten o&#39;clock at night when he stood before the prison of La Force,</li>
<li class="L13083" rel="L13083">where she had stood hundreds of times. A little wood-sawyer, having</li>
<li class="L13084" rel="L13084">closed his shop, was smoking his pipe at his shop-door.</li>
<li class="L13085" rel="L13085"></li>
<li class="L13086" rel="L13086">“Good night, citizen,” said Sydney Carton, pausing in going by; for, the</li>
<li class="L13087" rel="L13087">man eyed him inquisitively.</li>
<li class="L13088" rel="L13088"></li>
<li class="L13089" rel="L13089">“Good night, citizen.”</li>
<li class="L13090" rel="L13090"></li>
<li class="L13091" rel="L13091">“How goes the Republic?”</li>
<li class="L13092" rel="L13092"></li>
<li class="L13093" rel="L13093">“You mean the Guillotine. Not ill. Sixty-three to-day. We shall mount</li>
<li class="L13094" rel="L13094">to a hundred soon. Samson and his men complain sometimes, of being</li>
<li class="L13095" rel="L13095">exhausted. Ha, ha, ha! He is so droll, that Samson. Such a Barber!”</li>
<li class="L13096" rel="L13096"></li>
<li class="L13097" rel="L13097">“Do you often go to see him--”</li>
<li class="L13098" rel="L13098"></li>
<li class="L13099" rel="L13099">“Shave? Always. Every day. What a barber! You have seen him at work?”</li>
<li class="L13100" rel="L13100"></li>
<li class="L13101" rel="L13101">“Never.”</li>
<li class="L13102" rel="L13102"></li>
<li class="L13103" rel="L13103">“Go and see him when he has a good batch. Figure this to yourself,</li>
<li class="L13104" rel="L13104">citizen; he shaved the sixty-three to-day, in less than two pipes! Less</li>
<li class="L13105" rel="L13105">than two pipes. Word of honour!”</li>
<li class="L13106" rel="L13106"></li>
<li class="L13107" rel="L13107">As the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking, to explain</li>
<li class="L13108" rel="L13108">how he timed the executioner, Carton was so sensible of a rising desire</li>
<li class="L13109" rel="L13109">to strike the life out of him, that he turned away.</li>
<li class="L13110" rel="L13110"></li>
<li class="L13111" rel="L13111">“But you are not English,” said the wood-sawyer, “though you wear</li>
<li class="L13112" rel="L13112">English dress?”</li>
<li class="L13113" rel="L13113"></li>
<li class="L13114" rel="L13114">“Yes,” said Carton, pausing again, and answering over his shoulder.</li>
<li class="L13115" rel="L13115"></li>
<li class="L13116" rel="L13116">“You speak like a Frenchman.”</li>
<li class="L13117" rel="L13117"></li>
<li class="L13118" rel="L13118">“I am an old student here.”</li>
<li class="L13119" rel="L13119"></li>
<li class="L13120" rel="L13120">“Aha, a perfect Frenchman! Good night, Englishman.”</li>
<li class="L13121" rel="L13121"></li>
<li class="L13122" rel="L13122">“Good night, citizen.”</li>
<li class="L13123" rel="L13123"></li>
<li class="L13124" rel="L13124">“But go and see that droll dog,” the little man persisted, calling after</li>
<li class="L13125" rel="L13125">him. “And take a pipe with you!”</li>
<li class="L13126" rel="L13126"></li>
<li class="L13127" rel="L13127">Sydney had not gone far out of sight, when he stopped in the middle of</li>
<li class="L13128" rel="L13128">the street under a glimmering lamp, and wrote with his pencil on a scrap</li>
<li class="L13129" rel="L13129">of paper. Then, traversing with the decided step of one who remembered</li>
<li class="L13130" rel="L13130">the way well, several dark and dirty streets--much dirtier than usual,</li>
<li class="L13131" rel="L13131">for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in those times of</li>
<li class="L13132" rel="L13132">terror--he stopped at a chemist&#39;s shop, which the owner was closing with</li>
<li class="L13133" rel="L13133">his own hands. A small, dim, crooked shop, kept in a tortuous, up-hill</li>
<li class="L13134" rel="L13134">thoroughfare, by a small, dim, crooked man.</li>
<li class="L13135" rel="L13135"></li>
<li class="L13136" rel="L13136">Giving this citizen, too, good night, as he confronted him at his</li>
<li class="L13137" rel="L13137">counter, he laid the scrap of paper before him. “Whew!” the chemist</li>
<li class="L13138" rel="L13138">whistled softly, as he read it. “Hi! hi! hi!”</li>
<li class="L13139" rel="L13139"></li>
<li class="L13140" rel="L13140">Sydney Carton took no heed, and the chemist said:</li>
<li class="L13141" rel="L13141"></li>
<li class="L13142" rel="L13142">“For you, citizen?”</li>
<li class="L13143" rel="L13143"></li>
<li class="L13144" rel="L13144">“For me.”</li>
<li class="L13145" rel="L13145"></li>
<li class="L13146" rel="L13146">“You will be careful to keep them separate, citizen? You know the</li>
<li class="L13147" rel="L13147">consequences of mixing them?”</li>
<li class="L13148" rel="L13148"></li>
<li class="L13149" rel="L13149">“Perfectly.”</li>
<li class="L13150" rel="L13150"></li>
<li class="L13151" rel="L13151">Certain small packets were made and given to him. He put them, one by</li>
<li class="L13152" rel="L13152">one, in the breast of his inner coat, counted out the money for them,</li>
<li class="L13153" rel="L13153">and deliberately left the shop. “There is nothing more to do,” said he,</li>
<li class="L13154" rel="L13154">glancing upward at the moon, “until to-morrow. I can&#39;t sleep.”</li>
<li class="L13155" rel="L13155"></li>
<li class="L13156" rel="L13156">It was not a reckless manner, the manner in which he said these words</li>
<li class="L13157" rel="L13157">aloud under the fast-sailing clouds, nor was it more expressive of</li>
<li class="L13158" rel="L13158">negligence than defiance. It was the settled manner of a tired man, who</li>
<li class="L13159" rel="L13159">had wandered and struggled and got lost, but who at length struck into</li>
<li class="L13160" rel="L13160">his road and saw its end.</li>
<li class="L13161" rel="L13161"></li>
<li class="L13162" rel="L13162">Long ago, when he had been famous among his earliest competitors as a</li>
<li class="L13163" rel="L13163">youth of great promise, he had followed his father to the grave. His</li>
<li class="L13164" rel="L13164">mother had died, years before. These solemn words, which had been</li>
<li class="L13165" rel="L13165">read at his father&#39;s grave, arose in his mind as he went down the dark</li>
<li class="L13166" rel="L13166">streets, among the heavy shadows, with the moon and the clouds sailing</li>
<li class="L13167" rel="L13167">on high above him. “I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord:</li>
<li class="L13168" rel="L13168">he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and</li>
<li class="L13169" rel="L13169">whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die.”</li>
<li class="L13170" rel="L13170"></li>
<li class="L13171" rel="L13171">In a city dominated by the axe, alone at night, with natural sorrow</li>
<li class="L13172" rel="L13172">rising in him for the sixty-three who had been that day put to death,</li>
<li class="L13173" rel="L13173">and for to-morrow&#39;s victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons,</li>
<li class="L13174" rel="L13174">and still of to-morrow&#39;s and to-morrow&#39;s, the chain of association that</li>
<li class="L13175" rel="L13175">brought the words home, like a rusty old ship&#39;s anchor from the deep,</li>
<li class="L13176" rel="L13176">might have been easily found. He did not seek it, but repeated them and</li>
<li class="L13177" rel="L13177">went on.</li>
<li class="L13178" rel="L13178"></li>
<li class="L13179" rel="L13179">With a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were</li>
<li class="L13180" rel="L13180">going to rest, forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors</li>
<li class="L13181" rel="L13181">surrounding them; in the towers of the churches, where no prayers</li>
<li class="L13182" rel="L13182">were said, for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length</li>
<li class="L13183" rel="L13183">of self-destruction from years of priestly impostors, plunderers, and</li>
<li class="L13184" rel="L13184">profligates; in the distant burial-places, reserved, as they wrote upon</li>
<li class="L13185" rel="L13185">the gates, for Eternal Sleep; in the abounding gaols; and in the streets</li>
<li class="L13186" rel="L13186">along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and</li>
<li class="L13187" rel="L13187">material, that no sorrowful story of a haunting Spirit ever arose among</li>
<li class="L13188" rel="L13188">the people out of all the working of the Guillotine; with a solemn</li>
<li class="L13189" rel="L13189">interest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its</li>
<li class="L13190" rel="L13190">short nightly pause in fury; Sydney Carton crossed the Seine again for</li>
<li class="L13191" rel="L13191">the lighter streets.</li>
<li class="L13192" rel="L13192"></li>
<li class="L13193" rel="L13193">Few coaches were abroad, for riders in coaches were liable to be</li>
<li class="L13194" rel="L13194">suspected, and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps, and put on heavy</li>
<li class="L13195" rel="L13195">shoes, and trudged. But, the theatres were all well filled, and the</li>
<li class="L13196" rel="L13196">people poured cheerfully out as he passed, and went chatting home. At</li>
<li class="L13197" rel="L13197">one of the theatre doors, there was a little girl with a mother, looking</li>
<li class="L13198" rel="L13198">for a way across the street through the mud. He carried the child over,</li>
<li class="L13199" rel="L13199">and before the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss.</li>
<li class="L13200" rel="L13200"></li>
<li class="L13201" rel="L13201">“I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth</li>
<li class="L13202" rel="L13202">in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and</li>
<li class="L13203" rel="L13203">believeth in me, shall never die.”</li>
<li class="L13204" rel="L13204"></li>
<li class="L13205" rel="L13205">Now, that the streets were quiet, and the night wore on, the words</li>
<li class="L13206" rel="L13206">were in the echoes of his feet, and were in the air. Perfectly calm</li>
<li class="L13207" rel="L13207">and steady, he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked; but, he</li>
<li class="L13208" rel="L13208">heard them always.</li>
<li class="L13209" rel="L13209"></li>
<li class="L13210" rel="L13210">The night wore out, and, as he stood upon the bridge listening to the</li>
<li class="L13211" rel="L13211">water as it splashed the river-walls of the Island of Paris, where the</li>
<li class="L13212" rel="L13212">picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light</li>
<li class="L13213" rel="L13213">of the moon, the day came coldly, looking like a dead face out of the</li>
<li class="L13214" rel="L13214">sky. Then, the night, with the moon and the stars, turned pale and died,</li>
<li class="L13215" rel="L13215">and for a little while it seemed as if Creation were delivered over to</li>
<li class="L13216" rel="L13216">Death&#39;s dominion.</li>
<li class="L13217" rel="L13217"></li>
<li class="L13218" rel="L13218">But, the glorious sun, rising, seemed to strike those words, that burden</li>
<li class="L13219" rel="L13219">of the night, straight and warm to his heart in its long bright rays.</li>
<li class="L13220" rel="L13220">And looking along them, with reverently shaded eyes, a bridge of light</li>
<li class="L13221" rel="L13221">appeared to span the air between him and the sun, while the river</li>
<li class="L13222" rel="L13222">sparkled under it.</li>
<li class="L13223" rel="L13223"></li>
<li class="L13224" rel="L13224">The strong tide, so swift, so deep, and certain, was like a congenial</li>
<li class="L13225" rel="L13225">friend, in the morning stillness. He walked by the stream, far from the</li>
<li class="L13226" rel="L13226">houses, and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the</li>
<li class="L13227" rel="L13227">bank. When he awoke and was afoot again, he lingered there yet a little</li>
<li class="L13228" rel="L13228">longer, watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless, until the</li>
<li class="L13229" rel="L13229">stream absorbed it, and carried it on to the sea.--“Like me.”</li>
<li class="L13230" rel="L13230"></li>
<li class="L13231" rel="L13231">A trading-boat, with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf, then</li>
<li class="L13232" rel="L13232">glided into his view, floated by him, and died away. As its silent track</li>
<li class="L13233" rel="L13233">in the water disappeared, the prayer that had broken up out of his heart</li>
<li class="L13234" rel="L13234">for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors,</li>
<li class="L13235" rel="L13235">ended in the words, “I am the resurrection and the life.”</li>
<li class="L13236" rel="L13236"></li>
<li class="L13237" rel="L13237">Mr. Lorry was already out when he got back, and it was easy to surmise</li>
<li class="L13238" rel="L13238">where the good old man was gone. Sydney Carton drank nothing but a</li>
<li class="L13239" rel="L13239">little coffee, ate some bread, and, having washed and changed to refresh</li>
<li class="L13240" rel="L13240">himself, went out to the place of trial.</li>
<li class="L13241" rel="L13241"></li>
<li class="L13242" rel="L13242">The court was all astir and a-buzz, when the black sheep--whom many fell</li>
<li class="L13243" rel="L13243">away from in dread--pressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd.</li>
<li class="L13244" rel="L13244">Mr. Lorry was there, and Doctor Manette was there. She was there,</li>
<li class="L13245" rel="L13245">sitting beside her father.</li>
<li class="L13246" rel="L13246"></li>
<li class="L13247" rel="L13247">When her husband was brought in, she turned a look upon him, so</li>
<li class="L13248" rel="L13248">sustaining, so encouraging, so full of admiring love and pitying</li>
<li class="L13249" rel="L13249">tenderness, yet so courageous for his sake, that it called the healthy</li>
<li class="L13250" rel="L13250">blood into his face, brightened his glance, and animated his heart. If</li>
<li class="L13251" rel="L13251">there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look, on Sydney</li>
<li class="L13252" rel="L13252">Carton, it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly.</li>
<li class="L13253" rel="L13253"></li>
<li class="L13254" rel="L13254">Before that unjust Tribunal, there was little or no order of procedure,</li>
<li class="L13255" rel="L13255">ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing. There could have</li>
<li class="L13256" rel="L13256">been no such Revolution, if all laws, forms, and ceremonies, had not</li>
<li class="L13257" rel="L13257">first been so monstrously abused, that the suicidal vengeance of the</li>
<li class="L13258" rel="L13258">Revolution was to scatter them all to the winds.</li>
<li class="L13259" rel="L13259"></li>
<li class="L13260" rel="L13260">Every eye was turned to the jury. The same determined patriots and good</li>
<li class="L13261" rel="L13261">republicans as yesterday and the day before, and to-morrow and the day</li>
<li class="L13262" rel="L13262">after. Eager and prominent among them, one man with a craving face, and</li>
<li class="L13263" rel="L13263">his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips, whose appearance</li>
<li class="L13264" rel="L13264">gave great satisfaction to the spectators. A life-thirsting,</li>
<li class="L13265" rel="L13265">cannibal-looking, bloody-minded juryman, the Jacques Three of St.</li>
<li class="L13266" rel="L13266">Antoine. The whole jury, as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer.</li>
<li class="L13267" rel="L13267"></li>
<li class="L13268" rel="L13268">Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor.</li>
<li class="L13269" rel="L13269">No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day. A fell, uncompromising,</li>
<li class="L13270" rel="L13270">murderous business-meaning there. Every eye then sought some other eye</li>
<li class="L13271" rel="L13271">in the crowd, and gleamed at it approvingly; and heads nodded at one</li>
<li class="L13272" rel="L13272">another, before bending forward with a strained attention.</li>
<li class="L13273" rel="L13273"></li>
<li class="L13274" rel="L13274">Charles Evremonde, called Darnay. Released yesterday. Reaccused and</li>
<li class="L13275" rel="L13275">retaken yesterday. Indictment delivered to him last night. Suspected and</li>
<li class="L13276" rel="L13276">Denounced enemy of the Republic, Aristocrat, one of a family of tyrants,</li>
<li class="L13277" rel="L13277">one of a race proscribed, for that they had used their abolished</li>
<li class="L13278" rel="L13278">privileges to the infamous oppression of the people. Charles Evremonde,</li>
<li class="L13279" rel="L13279">called Darnay, in right of such proscription, absolutely Dead in Law.</li>
<li class="L13280" rel="L13280"></li>
<li class="L13281" rel="L13281">To this effect, in as few or fewer words, the Public Prosecutor.</li>
<li class="L13282" rel="L13282"></li>
<li class="L13283" rel="L13283">The President asked, was the Accused openly denounced or secretly?</li>
<li class="L13284" rel="L13284"></li>
<li class="L13285" rel="L13285">“Openly, President.”</li>
<li class="L13286" rel="L13286"></li>
<li class="L13287" rel="L13287">“By whom?”</li>
<li class="L13288" rel="L13288"></li>
<li class="L13289" rel="L13289">“Three voices. Ernest Defarge, wine-vendor of St. Antoine.”</li>
<li class="L13290" rel="L13290"></li>
<li class="L13291" rel="L13291">“Good.”</li>
<li class="L13292" rel="L13292"></li>
<li class="L13293" rel="L13293">“Therese Defarge, his wife.”</li>
<li class="L13294" rel="L13294"></li>
<li class="L13295" rel="L13295">“Good.”</li>
<li class="L13296" rel="L13296"></li>
<li class="L13297" rel="L13297">“Alexandre Manette, physician.”</li>
<li class="L13298" rel="L13298"></li>
<li class="L13299" rel="L13299">A great uproar took place in the court, and in the midst of it, Doctor</li>
<li class="L13300" rel="L13300">Manette was seen, pale and trembling, standing where he had been seated.</li>
<li class="L13301" rel="L13301"></li>
<li class="L13302" rel="L13302">“President, I indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and</li>
<li class="L13303" rel="L13303">a fraud. You know the accused to be the husband of my daughter. My</li>
<li class="L13304" rel="L13304">daughter, and those dear to her, are far dearer to me than my life. Who</li>
<li class="L13305" rel="L13305">and where is the false conspirator who says that I denounce the husband</li>
<li class="L13306" rel="L13306">of my child!”</li>
<li class="L13307" rel="L13307"></li>
<li class="L13308" rel="L13308">“Citizen Manette, be tranquil. To fail in submission to the authority of</li>
<li class="L13309" rel="L13309">the Tribunal would be to put yourself out of Law. As to what is dearer</li>
<li class="L13310" rel="L13310">to you than life, nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the</li>
<li class="L13311" rel="L13311">Republic.”</li>
<li class="L13312" rel="L13312"></li>
<li class="L13313" rel="L13313">Loud acclamations hailed this rebuke. The President rang his bell, and</li>
<li class="L13314" rel="L13314">with warmth resumed.</li>
<li class="L13315" rel="L13315"></li>
<li class="L13316" rel="L13316">“If the Republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child</li>
<li class="L13317" rel="L13317">herself, you would have no duty but to sacrifice her. Listen to what is</li>
<li class="L13318" rel="L13318">to follow. In the meanwhile, be silent!”</li>
<li class="L13319" rel="L13319"></li>
<li class="L13320" rel="L13320">Frantic acclamations were again raised. Doctor Manette sat down, with</li>
<li class="L13321" rel="L13321">his eyes looking around, and his lips trembling; his daughter drew</li>
<li class="L13322" rel="L13322">closer to him. The craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together,</li>
<li class="L13323" rel="L13323">and restored the usual hand to his mouth.</li>
<li class="L13324" rel="L13324"></li>
<li class="L13325" rel="L13325">Defarge was produced, when the court was quiet enough to admit of his</li>
<li class="L13326" rel="L13326">being heard, and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment, and of</li>
<li class="L13327" rel="L13327">his having been a mere boy in the Doctor&#39;s service, and of the release,</li>
<li class="L13328" rel="L13328">and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him.</li>
<li class="L13329" rel="L13329">This short examination followed, for the court was quick with its work.</li>
<li class="L13330" rel="L13330"></li>
<li class="L13331" rel="L13331">“You did good service at the taking of the Bastille, citizen?”</li>
<li class="L13332" rel="L13332"></li>
<li class="L13333" rel="L13333">“I believe so.”</li>
<li class="L13334" rel="L13334"></li>
<li class="L13335" rel="L13335">Here, an excited woman screeched from the crowd: “You were one of the</li>
<li class="L13336" rel="L13336">best patriots there. Why not say so? You were a cannonier that day</li>
<li class="L13337" rel="L13337">there, and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress when</li>
<li class="L13338" rel="L13338">it fell. Patriots, I speak the truth!”</li>
<li class="L13339" rel="L13339"></li>
<li class="L13340" rel="L13340">It was The Vengeance who, amidst the warm commendations of the audience,</li>
<li class="L13341" rel="L13341">thus assisted the proceedings. The President rang his bell; but, The</li>
<li class="L13342" rel="L13342">Vengeance, warming with encouragement, shrieked, “I defy that bell!”</li>
<li class="L13343" rel="L13343"> wherein she was likewise much commended.</li>
<li class="L13344" rel="L13344"></li>
<li class="L13345" rel="L13345">“Inform the Tribunal of what you did that day within the Bastille,</li>
<li class="L13346" rel="L13346">citizen.”</li>
<li class="L13347" rel="L13347"></li>
<li class="L13348" rel="L13348">“I knew,” said Defarge, looking down at his wife, who stood at the</li>
<li class="L13349" rel="L13349">bottom of the steps on which he was raised, looking steadily up at him;</li>
<li class="L13350" rel="L13350">“I knew that this prisoner, of whom I speak, had been confined in a cell</li>
<li class="L13351" rel="L13351">known as One Hundred and Five, North Tower. I knew it from himself. He</li>
<li class="L13352" rel="L13352">knew himself by no other name than One Hundred and Five, North Tower,</li>
<li class="L13353" rel="L13353">when he made shoes under my care. As I serve my gun that day, I resolve,</li>
<li class="L13354" rel="L13354">when the place shall fall, to examine that cell. It falls. I mount to</li>
<li class="L13355" rel="L13355">the cell, with a fellow-citizen who is one of the Jury, directed by a</li>
<li class="L13356" rel="L13356">gaoler. I examine it, very closely. In a hole in the chimney, where a</li>
<li class="L13357" rel="L13357">stone has been worked out and replaced, I find a written paper. This is</li>
<li class="L13358" rel="L13358">that written paper. I have made it my business to examine some specimens</li>
<li class="L13359" rel="L13359">of the writing of Doctor Manette. This is the writing of Doctor Manette.</li>
<li class="L13360" rel="L13360">I confide this paper, in the writing of Doctor Manette, to the hands of</li>
<li class="L13361" rel="L13361">the President.”</li>
<li class="L13362" rel="L13362"></li>
<li class="L13363" rel="L13363">“Let it be read.”</li>
<li class="L13364" rel="L13364"></li>
<li class="L13365" rel="L13365">In a dead silence and stillness--the prisoner under trial looking</li>
<li class="L13366" rel="L13366">lovingly at his wife, his wife only looking from him to look with</li>
<li class="L13367" rel="L13367">solicitude at her father, Doctor Manette keeping his eyes fixed on the</li>
<li class="L13368" rel="L13368">reader, Madame Defarge never taking hers from the prisoner, Defarge</li>
<li class="L13369" rel="L13369">never taking his from his feasting wife, and all the other eyes there</li>
<li class="L13370" rel="L13370">intent upon the Doctor, who saw none of them--the paper was read, as</li>

<li class="L13381" rel="L13381">cell in the Bastille, during the last month of the year, 1767. I write</li>
<li class="L13382" rel="L13382">it at stolen intervals, under every difficulty. I design to secrete it</li>
<li class="L13383" rel="L13383">in the wall of the chimney, where I have slowly and laboriously made a</li>
<li class="L13384" rel="L13384">place of concealment for it. Some pitying hand may find it there, when I</li>

<li class="L13389" rel="L13389">with blood, in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity. Hope</li>
<li class="L13390" rel="L13390">has quite departed from my breast. I know from terrible warnings I have</li>
<li class="L13391" rel="L13391">noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired, but I</li>
<li class="L13392" rel="L13392">solemnly declare that I am at this time in the possession of my right</li>

<li class="L13398" rel="L13398">twenty-second of the month) in the year 1757, I was walking on a retired</li>
<li class="L13399" rel="L13399">part of the quay by the Seine for the refreshment of the frosty air,</li>
<li class="L13400" rel="L13400">at an hour&#39;s distance from my place of residence in the Street of the</li>
<li class="L13401" rel="L13401">School of Medicine, when a carriage came along behind me, driven very</li>
<li class="L13402" rel="L13402">fast. As I stood aside to let that carriage pass, apprehensive that it</li>
<li class="L13403" rel="L13403">might otherwise run me down, a head was put out at the window, and a</li>
<li class="L13404" rel="L13404">voice called to the driver to stop.</li>
<li class="L13405" rel="L13405"></li>
<li class="L13406" rel="L13406">“The carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses,</li>
<li class="L13407" rel="L13407">and the same voice called to me by my name. I answered. The carriage</li>
<li class="L13408" rel="L13408">was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the</li>
<li class="L13409" rel="L13409">door and alight before I came up with it.</li>
<li class="L13410" rel="L13410"></li>
<li class="L13411" rel="L13411">“I observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to</li>
<li class="L13412" rel="L13412">conceal themselves. As they stood side by side near the carriage door,</li>
<li class="L13413" rel="L13413">I also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather</li>
<li class="L13414" rel="L13414">younger, and that they were greatly alike, in stature, manner, voice,</li>

<li class="L13423" rel="L13423">has made a rising reputation in Paris?&#39;</li>

<li class="L13429" rel="L13429">so fortunate as to find you there, and being informed that you were</li>
<li class="L13430" rel="L13430">probably walking in this direction, we followed, in the hope of</li>
<li class="L13431" rel="L13431">overtaking you. Will you please to enter the carriage?&#39;</li>
<li class="L13432" rel="L13432"></li>
<li class="L13433" rel="L13433">“The manner of both was imperious, and they both moved, as these words</li>

<li class="L13439" rel="L13439">which I am summoned.&#39;</li>
<li class="L13440" rel="L13440"></li>
<li class="L13441" rel="L13441">“The reply to this was made by him who had spoken second. &#39;Doctor,</li>
<li class="L13442" rel="L13442">your clients are people of condition. As to the nature of the case,</li>
<li class="L13443" rel="L13443">our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for</li>
<li class="L13444" rel="L13444">yourself better than we can describe it. Enough. Will you please to</li>

<li class="L13448" rel="L13448">entered after me--the last springing in, after putting up the steps. The</li>
<li class="L13449" rel="L13449">carriage turned about, and drove on at its former speed.</li>

<li class="L13454" rel="L13454">the broken marks that follow here, I leave off for the time, and put my</li>

<li class="L13462" rel="L13462">when I traversed it--it struck out of the main avenue, and presently</li>
<li class="L13463" rel="L13463">stopped at a solitary house, We all three alighted, and walked, by</li>
<li class="L13464" rel="L13464">a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had</li>
<li class="L13465" rel="L13465">overflowed, to the door of the house. It was not opened immediately, in</li>

<li class="L13468" rel="L13468"></li>
<li class="L13469" rel="L13469">“There was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention,</li>
<li class="L13470" rel="L13470">for I had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs. But, the</li>
<li class="L13471" rel="L13471">other of the two, being angry likewise, struck the man in like manner</li>
<li class="L13472" rel="L13472">with his arm; the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly</li>
<li class="L13473" rel="L13473">alike, that I then first perceived them to be twin brothers.</li>
<li class="L13474" rel="L13474"></li>
<li class="L13475" rel="L13475">“From the time of our alighting at the outer gate (which we found</li>
<li class="L13476" rel="L13476">locked, and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us, and had</li>
<li class="L13477" rel="L13477">relocked), I had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber. I was</li>
<li class="L13478" rel="L13478">conducted to this chamber straight, the cries growing louder as we</li>
<li class="L13479" rel="L13479">ascended the stairs, and I found a patient in a high fever of the brain,</li>
<li class="L13480" rel="L13480">lying on a bed.</li>
<li class="L13481" rel="L13481"></li>
<li class="L13482" rel="L13482">“The patient was a woman of great beauty, and young; assuredly not much</li>
<li class="L13483" rel="L13483">past twenty. Her hair was torn and ragged, and her arms were bound to</li>
<li class="L13484" rel="L13484">her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs. I noticed that these bonds were</li>
<li class="L13485" rel="L13485">all portions of a gentleman&#39;s dress. On one of them, which was a fringed</li>
<li class="L13486" rel="L13486">scarf for a dress of ceremony, I saw the armorial bearings of a Noble,</li>
<li class="L13487" rel="L13487">and the letter E.</li>
<li class="L13488" rel="L13488"></li>
<li class="L13489" rel="L13489">“I saw this, within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient;</li>
<li class="L13490" rel="L13490">for, in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the</li>
<li class="L13491" rel="L13491">edge of the bed, had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth, and was</li>
<li class="L13492" rel="L13492">in danger of suffocation. My first act was to put out my hand to relieve</li>
<li class="L13493" rel="L13493">her breathing; and in moving the scarf aside, the embroidery in the</li>
<li class="L13494" rel="L13494">corner caught my sight.</li>
<li class="L13495" rel="L13495"></li>
<li class="L13496" rel="L13496">“I turned her gently over, placed my hands upon her breast to calm her</li>
<li class="L13497" rel="L13497">and keep her down, and looked into her face. Her eyes were dilated and</li>
<li class="L13498" rel="L13498">wild, and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks, and repeated the</li>
<li class="L13499" rel="L13499">words, &#39;My husband, my father, and my brother!&#39; and then counted up to</li>
<li class="L13500" rel="L13500">twelve, and said, &#39;Hush!&#39; For an instant, and no more, she would pause</li>
<li class="L13501" rel="L13501">to listen, and then the piercing shrieks would begin again, and she</li>
<li class="L13502" rel="L13502">would repeat the cry, &#39;My husband, my father, and my brother!&#39; and</li>
<li class="L13503" rel="L13503">would count up to twelve, and say, &#39;Hush!&#39; There was no variation in the</li>
<li class="L13504" rel="L13504">order, or the manner. There was no cessation, but the regular moment&#39;s</li>
<li class="L13505" rel="L13505">pause, in the utterance of these sounds.</li>
<li class="L13506" rel="L13506"></li>
<li class="L13507" rel="L13507">“&#39;How long,&#39; I asked, &#39;has this lasted?&#39;</li>
<li class="L13508" rel="L13508"></li>
<li class="L13509" rel="L13509">“To distinguish the brothers, I will call them the elder and the</li>
<li class="L13510" rel="L13510">younger; by the elder, I mean him who exercised the most authority. It</li>
<li class="L13511" rel="L13511">was the elder who replied, &#39;Since about this hour last night.&#39;</li>
<li class="L13512" rel="L13512"></li>
<li class="L13513" rel="L13513">“&#39;She has a husband, a father, and a brother?&#39;</li>
<li class="L13514" rel="L13514"></li>
<li class="L13515" rel="L13515">“&#39;A brother.&#39;</li>
<li class="L13516" rel="L13516"></li>
<li class="L13517" rel="L13517">“&#39;I do not address her brother?&#39;</li>
<li class="L13518" rel="L13518"></li>
<li class="L13519" rel="L13519">“He answered with great contempt, &#39;No.&#39;</li>
<li class="L13520" rel="L13520"></li>
<li class="L13521" rel="L13521">“&#39;She has some recent association with the number twelve?&#39;</li>
<li class="L13522" rel="L13522"></li>
<li class="L13523" rel="L13523">“The younger brother impatiently rejoined, &#39;With twelve o&#39;clock?&#39;</li>
<li class="L13524" rel="L13524"></li>
<li class="L13525" rel="L13525">“&#39;See, gentlemen,&#39; said I, still keeping my hands upon her breast, &#39;how</li>
<li class="L13526" rel="L13526">useless I am, as you have brought me! If I had known what I was coming</li>
<li class="L13527" rel="L13527">to see, I could have come provided. As it is, time must be lost. There</li>
<li class="L13528" rel="L13528">are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place.&#39;</li>
<li class="L13529" rel="L13529"></li>
<li class="L13530" rel="L13530">“The elder brother looked to the younger, who said haughtily, &#39;There is</li>
<li class="L13531" rel="L13531">a case of medicines here;&#39; and brought it from a closet, and put it on</li>
<li class="L13532" rel="L13532">the table.</li>
<li class="L13533" rel="L13533"></li>
<li class="L13534" rel="L13534">        *****</li>
<li class="L13535" rel="L13535"></li>
<li class="L13536" rel="L13536">“I opened some of the bottles, smelt them, and put the stoppers to my</li>
<li class="L13537" rel="L13537">lips. If I had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were</li>
<li class="L13538" rel="L13538">poisons in themselves, I would not have administered any of those.</li>
<li class="L13539" rel="L13539"></li>
<li class="L13540" rel="L13540">“&#39;Do you doubt them?&#39; asked the younger brother.</li>
<li class="L13541" rel="L13541"></li>
<li class="L13542" rel="L13542">“&#39;You see, monsieur, I am going to use them,&#39; I replied, and said no</li>
<li class="L13543" rel="L13543">more.</li>
<li class="L13544" rel="L13544"></li>
<li class="L13545" rel="L13545">“I made the patient swallow, with great difficulty, and after many</li>
<li class="L13546" rel="L13546">efforts, the dose that I desired to give. As I intended to repeat it</li>
<li class="L13547" rel="L13547">after a while, and as it was necessary to watch its influence, I then</li>
<li class="L13548" rel="L13548">sat down by the side of the bed. There was a timid and suppressed woman</li>
<li class="L13549" rel="L13549">in attendance (wife of the man down-stairs), who had retreated into</li>
<li class="L13550" rel="L13550">a corner. The house was damp and decayed, indifferently</li>
<li class="L13551" rel="L13551">furnished--evidently, recently occupied and temporarily used. Some thick</li>
<li class="L13552" rel="L13552">old hangings had been nailed up before the windows, to deaden the</li>
<li class="L13553" rel="L13553">sound of the shrieks. They continued to be uttered in their regular</li>
<li class="L13554" rel="L13554">succession, with the cry, &#39;My husband, my father, and my brother!&#39; the</li>
<li class="L13555" rel="L13555">counting up to twelve, and &#39;Hush!&#39; The frenzy was so violent, that I had</li>
<li class="L13556" rel="L13556">not unfastened the bandages restraining the arms; but, I had looked to</li>
<li class="L13557" rel="L13557">them, to see that they were not painful. The only spark of encouragement</li>
<li class="L13558" rel="L13558">in the case, was, that my hand upon the sufferer&#39;s breast had this much</li>
<li class="L13559" rel="L13559">soothing influence, that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the</li>
<li class="L13560" rel="L13560">figure. It had no effect upon the cries; no pendulum could be more</li>
<li class="L13561" rel="L13561">regular.</li>
<li class="L13562" rel="L13562"></li>
<li class="L13563" rel="L13563">“For the reason that my hand had this effect (I assume), I had sat by</li>
<li class="L13564" rel="L13564">the side of the bed for half an hour, with the two brothers looking on,</li>
<li class="L13565" rel="L13565">before the elder said:</li>
<li class="L13566" rel="L13566"></li>
<li class="L13567" rel="L13567">“&#39;There is another patient.&#39;</li>
<li class="L13568" rel="L13568"></li>
<li class="L13569" rel="L13569">“I was startled, and asked, &#39;Is it a pressing case?&#39;</li>
<li class="L13570" rel="L13570"></li>
<li class="L13571" rel="L13571">“&#39;You had better see,&#39; he carelessly answered; and took up a light.</li>
<li class="L13572" rel="L13572"></li>
<li class="L13573" rel="L13573">        *****</li>
<li class="L13574" rel="L13574"></li>
<li class="L13575" rel="L13575">“The other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase, which</li>
<li class="L13576" rel="L13576">was a species of loft over a stable. There was a low plastered ceiling</li>
<li class="L13577" rel="L13577">to a part of it; the rest was open, to the ridge of the tiled roof, and</li>
<li class="L13578" rel="L13578">there were beams across. Hay and straw were stored in that portion of</li>
<li class="L13579" rel="L13579">the place, fagots for firing, and a heap of apples in sand. I had to</li>
<li class="L13580" rel="L13580">pass through that part, to get at the other. My memory is circumstantial</li>
<li class="L13581" rel="L13581">and unshaken. I try it with these details, and I see them all, in</li>
<li class="L13582" rel="L13582">this my cell in the Bastille, near the close of the tenth year of my</li>
<li class="L13583" rel="L13583">captivity, as I saw them all that night.</li>
<li class="L13584" rel="L13584"></li>
<li class="L13585" rel="L13585">“On some hay on the ground, with a cushion thrown under his head, lay a</li>
<li class="L13586" rel="L13586">handsome peasant boy--a boy of not more than seventeen at the most.</li>
<li class="L13587" rel="L13587">He lay on his back, with his teeth set, his right hand clenched on his</li>
<li class="L13588" rel="L13588">breast, and his glaring eyes looking straight upward. I could not see</li>
<li class="L13589" rel="L13589">where his wound was, as I kneeled on one knee over him; but, I could see</li>
<li class="L13590" rel="L13590">that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point.</li>
<li class="L13591" rel="L13591"></li>
<li class="L13592" rel="L13592">“&#39;I am a doctor, my poor fellow,&#39; said I. &#39;Let me examine it.&#39;</li>
<li class="L13593" rel="L13593"></li>
<li class="L13594" rel="L13594">“&#39;I do not want it examined,&#39; he answered; &#39;let it be.&#39;</li>
<li class="L13595" rel="L13595"></li>
<li class="L13596" rel="L13596">“It was under his hand, and I soothed him to let me move his hand away.</li>
<li class="L13597" rel="L13597">The wound was a sword-thrust, received from twenty to twenty-four hours</li>
<li class="L13598" rel="L13598">before, but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to</li>
<li class="L13599" rel="L13599">without delay. He was then dying fast. As I turned my eyes to the elder</li>
<li class="L13600" rel="L13600">brother, I saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was</li>
<li class="L13601" rel="L13601">ebbing out, as if he were a wounded bird, or hare, or rabbit; not at all</li>
<li class="L13602" rel="L13602">as if he were a fellow-creature.</li>
<li class="L13603" rel="L13603"></li>
<li class="L13604" rel="L13604">“&#39;How has this been done, monsieur?&#39; said I.</li>
<li class="L13605" rel="L13605"></li>
<li class="L13606" rel="L13606">“&#39;A crazed young common dog! A serf! Forced my brother to draw upon him,</li>
<li class="L13607" rel="L13607">and has fallen by my brother&#39;s sword--like a gentleman.&#39;</li>
<li class="L13608" rel="L13608"></li>
<li class="L13609" rel="L13609">“There was no touch of pity, sorrow, or kindred humanity, in this</li>
<li class="L13610" rel="L13610">answer. The speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to</li>
<li class="L13611" rel="L13611">have that different order of creature dying there, and that it would</li>
<li class="L13612" rel="L13612">have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his</li>
<li class="L13613" rel="L13613">vermin kind. He was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about</li>
<li class="L13614" rel="L13614">the boy, or about his fate.</li>
<li class="L13615" rel="L13615"></li>
<li class="L13616" rel="L13616">“The boy&#39;s eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken, and they now</li>
<li class="L13617" rel="L13617">slowly moved to me.</li>
<li class="L13618" rel="L13618"></li>
<li class="L13619" rel="L13619">“&#39;Doctor, they are very proud, these Nobles; but we common dogs are</li>
<li class="L13620" rel="L13620">proud too, sometimes. They plunder us, outrage us, beat us, kill us; but</li>
<li class="L13621" rel="L13621">we have a little pride left, sometimes. She--have you seen her, Doctor?&#39;</li>
<li class="L13622" rel="L13622"></li>
<li class="L13623" rel="L13623">“The shrieks and the cries were audible there, though subdued by the</li>
<li class="L13624" rel="L13624">distance. He referred to them, as if she were lying in our presence.</li>
<li class="L13625" rel="L13625"></li>
<li class="L13626" rel="L13626">“I said, &#39;I have seen her.&#39;</li>
<li class="L13627" rel="L13627"></li>
<li class="L13628" rel="L13628">“&#39;She is my sister, Doctor. They have had their shameful rights, these</li>
<li class="L13629" rel="L13629">Nobles, in the modesty and virtue of our sisters, many years, but we</li>
<li class="L13630" rel="L13630">have had good girls among us. I know it, and have heard my father say</li>
<li class="L13631" rel="L13631">so. She was a good girl. She was betrothed to a good young man, too: a</li>
<li class="L13632" rel="L13632">tenant of his. We were all tenants of his--that man&#39;s who stands there.</li>
<li class="L13633" rel="L13633">The other is his brother, the worst of a bad race.&#39;</li>
<li class="L13634" rel="L13634"></li>
<li class="L13635" rel="L13635">“It was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force</li>
<li class="L13636" rel="L13636">to speak; but, his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis.</li>
<li class="L13637" rel="L13637"></li>
<li class="L13638" rel="L13638">“&#39;We were so robbed by that man who stands there, as all we common dogs</li>
<li class="L13639" rel="L13639">are by those superior Beings--taxed by him without mercy, obliged to</li>
<li class="L13640" rel="L13640">work for him without pay, obliged to grind our corn at his mill, obliged</li>
<li class="L13641" rel="L13641">to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops, and forbidden</li>
<li class="L13642" rel="L13642">for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own, pillaged and</li>
<li class="L13643" rel="L13643">plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat, we</li>
<li class="L13644" rel="L13644">ate it in fear, with the door barred and the shutters closed, that his</li>
<li class="L13645" rel="L13645">people should not see it and take it from us--I say, we were so robbed,</li>
<li class="L13646" rel="L13646">and hunted, and were made so poor, that our father told us it was a</li>
<li class="L13647" rel="L13647">dreadful thing to bring a child into the world, and that what we should</li>
<li class="L13648" rel="L13648">most pray for, was, that our women might be barren and our miserable</li>
<li class="L13649" rel="L13649">race die out!&#39;</li>
<li class="L13650" rel="L13650"></li>
<li class="L13651" rel="L13651">“I had never before seen the sense of being oppressed, bursting forth</li>
<li class="L13652" rel="L13652">like a fire. I had supposed that it must be latent in the people</li>
<li class="L13653" rel="L13653">somewhere; but, I had never seen it break out, until I saw it in the</li>
<li class="L13654" rel="L13654">dying boy.</li>
<li class="L13655" rel="L13655"></li>
<li class="L13656" rel="L13656">“&#39;Nevertheless, Doctor, my sister married. He was ailing at that time,</li>
<li class="L13657" rel="L13657">poor fellow, and she married her lover, that she might tend and comfort</li>
<li class="L13658" rel="L13658">him in our cottage--our dog-hut, as that man would call it. She had not</li>
<li class="L13659" rel="L13659">been married many weeks, when that man&#39;s brother saw her and admired</li>
<li class="L13660" rel="L13660">her, and asked that man to lend her to him--for what are husbands among</li>
<li class="L13661" rel="L13661">us! He was willing enough, but my sister was good and virtuous, and</li>
<li class="L13662" rel="L13662">hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine. What did the two</li>
<li class="L13663" rel="L13663">then, to persuade her husband to use his influence with her, to make her</li>
<li class="L13664" rel="L13664">willing?&#39;</li>
<li class="L13665" rel="L13665"></li>
<li class="L13666" rel="L13666">“The boy&#39;s eyes, which had been fixed on mine, slowly turned to the</li>
<li class="L13667" rel="L13667">looker-on, and I saw in the two faces that all he said was true. The two</li>
<li class="L13668" rel="L13668">opposing kinds of pride confronting one another, I can see, even in this</li>
<li class="L13669" rel="L13669">Bastille; the gentleman&#39;s, all negligent indifference; the peasant&#39;s, all</li>
<li class="L13670" rel="L13670">trodden-down sentiment, and passionate revenge.</li>
<li class="L13671" rel="L13671"></li>
<li class="L13672" rel="L13672">“&#39;You know, Doctor, that it is among the Rights of these Nobles to</li>
<li class="L13673" rel="L13673">harness us common dogs to carts, and drive us. They so harnessed him and</li>
<li class="L13674" rel="L13674">drove him. You know that it is among their Rights to keep us in their</li>
<li class="L13675" rel="L13675">grounds all night, quieting the frogs, in order that their noble sleep</li>
<li class="L13676" rel="L13676">may not be disturbed. They kept him out in the unwholesome mists at</li>
<li class="L13677" rel="L13677">night, and ordered him back into his harness in the day. But he was</li>
<li class="L13678" rel="L13678">not persuaded. No! Taken out of harness one day at noon, to feed--if he</li>
<li class="L13679" rel="L13679">could find food--he sobbed twelve times, once for every stroke of the</li>
<li class="L13680" rel="L13680">bell, and died on her bosom.&#39;</li>
<li class="L13681" rel="L13681"></li>
<li class="L13682" rel="L13682">“Nothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to</li>
<li class="L13683" rel="L13683">tell all his wrong. He forced back the gathering shadows of death, as</li>
<li class="L13684" rel="L13684">he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched, and to cover his</li>
<li class="L13685" rel="L13685">wound.</li>

<li class="L13688" rel="L13688">brother took her away; in spite of what I know she must have told his</li>
<li class="L13689" rel="L13689">brother--and what that is, will not be long unknown to you, Doctor, if</li>
<li class="L13690" rel="L13690">it is now--his brother took her away--for his pleasure and diversion,</li>
<li class="L13691" rel="L13691">for a little while. I saw her pass me on the road. When I took the</li>
<li class="L13692" rel="L13692">tidings home, our father&#39;s heart burst; he never spoke one of the words</li>
<li class="L13693" rel="L13693">that filled it. I took my young sister (for I have another) to a place</li>
<li class="L13694" rel="L13694">beyond the reach of this man, and where, at least, she will never be</li>
<li class="L13695" rel="L13695">_his_ vassal. Then, I tracked the brother here, and last night climbed</li>
<li class="L13696" rel="L13696">in--a common dog, but sword in hand.--Where is the loft window? It was</li>
<li class="L13697" rel="L13697">somewhere here?&#39;</li>
<li class="L13698" rel="L13698"></li>
<li class="L13699" rel="L13699">“The room was darkening to his sight; the world was narrowing around</li>
<li class="L13700" rel="L13700">him. I glanced about me, and saw that the hay and straw were trampled</li>
<li class="L13701" rel="L13701">over the floor, as if there had been a struggle.</li>
<li class="L13702" rel="L13702"></li>
<li class="L13703" rel="L13703">“&#39;She heard me, and ran in. I told her not to come near us till he was</li>
<li class="L13704" rel="L13704">dead. He came in and first tossed me some pieces of money; then struck</li>
<li class="L13705" rel="L13705">at me with a whip. But I, though a common dog, so struck at him as to</li>
<li class="L13706" rel="L13706">make him draw. Let him break into as many pieces as he will, the sword</li>
<li class="L13707" rel="L13707">that he stained with my common blood; he drew to defend himself--thrust</li>
<li class="L13708" rel="L13708">at me with all his skill for his life.&#39;</li>
<li class="L13709" rel="L13709"></li>
<li class="L13710" rel="L13710">“My glance had fallen, but a few moments before, on the fragments of</li>
<li class="L13711" rel="L13711">a broken sword, lying among the hay. That weapon was a gentleman&#39;s. In</li>
<li class="L13712" rel="L13712">another place, lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldier&#39;s.</li>
<li class="L13713" rel="L13713"></li>
<li class="L13714" rel="L13714">“&#39;Now, lift me up, Doctor; lift me up. Where is he?&#39;</li>

<li class="L13719" rel="L13719">“&#39;He! Proud as these nobles are, he is afraid to see me. Where is the</li>

<li class="L13721" rel="L13721"></li>

<li class="L13723" rel="L13723">moment with extraordinary power, he raised himself completely: obliging</li>
<li class="L13724" rel="L13724">me to rise too, or I could not have still supported him.</li>

<li class="L13728" rel="L13728">answered for, I summon you and yours, to the last of your bad race, to</li>

<li class="L13737" rel="L13737">finger yet raised, and as it dropped, he dropped with it, and I laid him</li>
<li class="L13738" rel="L13738">down dead.</li>

<li class="L13743" rel="L13743">in precisely the same order of continuity. I knew that this might last</li>
<li class="L13744" rel="L13744">for many hours, and that it would probably end in the silence of the</li>
<li class="L13745" rel="L13745">grave.</li>
<li class="L13746" rel="L13746"></li>
<li class="L13747" rel="L13747">“I repeated the medicines I had given her, and I sat at the side of</li>
<li class="L13748" rel="L13748">the bed until the night was far advanced. She never abated the piercing</li>
<li class="L13749" rel="L13749">quality of her shrieks, never stumbled in the distinctness or the order</li>
<li class="L13750" rel="L13750">of her words. They were always &#39;My husband, my father, and my brother!</li>
<li class="L13751" rel="L13751">One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven,</li>

<li class="L13753" rel="L13753"></li>
<li class="L13754" rel="L13754">“This lasted twenty-six hours from the time when I first saw her. I had</li>
<li class="L13755" rel="L13755">come and gone twice, and was again sitting by her, when she began to</li>
<li class="L13756" rel="L13756">falter. I did what little could be done to assist that opportunity, and</li>
<li class="L13757" rel="L13757">by-and-bye she sank into a lethargy, and lay like the dead.</li>
<li class="L13758" rel="L13758"></li>

<li class="L13761" rel="L13761">compose her figure and the dress she had torn. It was then that I knew</li>
<li class="L13762" rel="L13762">her condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being</li>
<li class="L13763" rel="L13763">a mother have arisen; and it was then that I lost the little hope I had</li>

<li class="L13782" rel="L13782">recommended that your aid should be invited. Your reputation is high,</li>
<li class="L13783" rel="L13783">and, as a young man with your fortune to make, you are probably mindful</li>
<li class="L13784" rel="L13784">of your interest. The things that you see here, are things to be seen,</li>
<li class="L13785" rel="L13785">and not spoken of.&#39;</li>
<li class="L13786" rel="L13786"></li>

<li class="L13793" rel="L13793">was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen.</li>
<li class="L13794" rel="L13794"></li>
<li class="L13795" rel="L13795">“Her breathing was so difficult to trace, that I carefully tried the</li>

<li class="L13804" rel="L13804">failure in my memory; it can recall, and could detail, every word that</li>
<li class="L13805" rel="L13805">was ever spoken between me and those brothers.</li>
<li class="L13806" rel="L13806"></li>

<li class="L13808" rel="L13808">syllables that she said to me, by placing my ear close to her lips. She</li>
<li class="L13809" rel="L13809">asked me where she was, and I told her; who I was, and I told her. It</li>
<li class="L13810" rel="L13810">was in vain that I asked her for her family name. She faintly shook her</li>
<li class="L13811" rel="L13811">head upon the pillow, and kept her secret, as the boy had done.</li>
<li class="L13812" rel="L13812"></li>
<li class="L13813" rel="L13813">“I had no opportunity of asking her any question, until I had told the</li>
<li class="L13814" rel="L13814">brothers she was sinking fast, and could not live another day. Until</li>
<li class="L13815" rel="L13815">then, though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the</li>
<li class="L13816" rel="L13816">woman and myself, one or other of them had always jealously sat behind</li>
<li class="L13817" rel="L13817">the curtain at the head of the bed when I was there. But when it came to</li>
<li class="L13818" rel="L13818">that, they seemed careless what communication I might hold with her; as</li>
<li class="L13819" rel="L13819">if--the thought passed through my mind--I were dying too.</li>

<li class="L13823" rel="L13823">peasant a boy. The only consideration that appeared to affect the mind</li>
<li class="L13824" rel="L13824">of either of them was the consideration that this was highly degrading</li>
<li class="L13825" rel="L13825">to the family, and was ridiculous. As often as I caught the younger</li>
<li class="L13826" rel="L13826">brother&#39;s eyes, their expression reminded me that he disliked me deeply,</li>
<li class="L13827" rel="L13827">for knowing what I knew from the boy. He was smoother and more polite to</li>
<li class="L13828" rel="L13828">me than the elder; but I saw this. I also saw that I was an incumbrance</li>
<li class="L13829" rel="L13829">in the mind of the elder, too.</li>
<li class="L13830" rel="L13830"></li>
<li class="L13831" rel="L13831">“My patient died, two hours before midnight--at a time, by my watch,</li>

<li class="L13833" rel="L13833">with her, when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one side, and</li>
<li class="L13834" rel="L13834">all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended.</li>

<li class="L13910" rel="L13910">“These scraps of paper fail me. One was taken from me, with a warning,</li>
<li class="L13911" rel="L13911">yesterday. I must finish my record to-day.</li>
<li class="L13912" rel="L13912"></li>
<li class="L13913" rel="L13913">“She was a good, compassionate lady, and not happy in her marriage. How</li>
<li class="L13914" rel="L13914">could she be! The brother distrusted and disliked her, and his influence</li>
<li class="L13915" rel="L13915">was all opposed to her; she stood in dread of him, and in dread of her</li>
<li class="L13916" rel="L13916">husband too. When I handed her down to the door, there was a child, a</li>
<li class="L13917" rel="L13917">pretty boy from two to three years old, in her carriage.</li>
<li class="L13918" rel="L13918"></li>
<li class="L13919" rel="L13919">“&#39;For his sake, Doctor,&#39; she said, pointing to him in tears, &#39;I would do</li>
<li class="L13920" rel="L13920">all I can to make what poor amends I can. He will never prosper in his</li>
<li class="L13921" rel="L13921">inheritance otherwise. I have a presentiment that if no other innocent</li>
<li class="L13922" rel="L13922">atonement is made for this, it will one day be required of him. What</li>
<li class="L13923" rel="L13923">I have left to call my own--it is little beyond the worth of a few</li>
<li class="L13924" rel="L13924">jewels--I will make it the first charge of his life to bestow, with the</li>
<li class="L13925" rel="L13925">compassion and lamenting of his dead mother, on this injured family, if</li>
<li class="L13926" rel="L13926">the sister can be discovered.&#39;</li>
<li class="L13927" rel="L13927"></li>
<li class="L13928" rel="L13928">“She kissed the boy, and said, caressing him, &#39;It is for thine own dear</li>
<li class="L13929" rel="L13929">sake. Thou wilt be faithful, little Charles?&#39; The child answered her</li>
<li class="L13930" rel="L13930">bravely, &#39;Yes!&#39; I kissed her hand, and she took him in her arms, and</li>
<li class="L13931" rel="L13931">went away caressing him. I never saw her more.</li>
<li class="L13932" rel="L13932"></li>
<li class="L13933" rel="L13933">“As she had mentioned her husband&#39;s name in the faith that I knew it,</li>
<li class="L13934" rel="L13934">I added no mention of it to my letter. I sealed my letter, and, not</li>
<li class="L13935" rel="L13935">trusting it out of my own hands, delivered it myself that day.</li>
<li class="L13936" rel="L13936"></li>
<li class="L13937" rel="L13937">“That night, the last night of the year, towards nine o&#39;clock, a man in</li>
<li class="L13938" rel="L13938">a black dress rang at my gate, demanded to see me, and softly followed</li>
<li class="L13939" rel="L13939">my servant, Ernest Defarge, a youth, up-stairs. When my servant came</li>
<li class="L13940" rel="L13940">into the room where I sat with my wife--O my wife, beloved of my heart!</li>
<li class="L13941" rel="L13941">My fair young English wife!--we saw the man, who was supposed to be at</li>
<li class="L13942" rel="L13942">the gate, standing silent behind him.</li>
<li class="L13943" rel="L13943"></li>
<li class="L13944" rel="L13944">“An urgent case in the Rue St. Honore, he said. It would not detain me,</li>
<li class="L13945" rel="L13945">he had a coach in waiting.</li>
<li class="L13946" rel="L13946"></li>
<li class="L13947" rel="L13947">“It brought me here, it brought me to my grave. When I was clear of the</li>
<li class="L13948" rel="L13948">house, a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind, and</li>
<li class="L13949" rel="L13949">my arms were pinioned. The two brothers crossed the road from a dark</li>
<li class="L13950" rel="L13950">corner, and identified me with a single gesture. The Marquis took from</li>
<li class="L13951" rel="L13951">his pocket the letter I had written, showed it me, burnt it in the light</li>
<li class="L13952" rel="L13952">of a lantern that was held, and extinguished the ashes with his foot.</li>
<li class="L13953" rel="L13953">Not a word was spoken. I was brought here, I was brought to my living</li>
<li class="L13954" rel="L13954">grave.</li>
<li class="L13955" rel="L13955"></li>
<li class="L13956" rel="L13956">“If it had pleased _God_ to put it in the hard heart of either of the</li>
<li class="L13957" rel="L13957">brothers, in all these frightful years, to grant me any tidings of</li>
<li class="L13958" rel="L13958">my dearest wife--so much as to let me know by a word whether alive or</li>
<li class="L13959" rel="L13959">dead--I might have thought that He had not quite abandoned them. But,</li>
<li class="L13960" rel="L13960">now I believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them, and that</li>
<li class="L13961" rel="L13961">they have no part in His mercies. And them and their descendants, to the</li>
<li class="L13962" rel="L13962">last of their race, I, Alexandre Manette, unhappy prisoner, do this last</li>
<li class="L13963" rel="L13963">night of the year 1767, in my unbearable agony, denounce to the times</li>
<li class="L13964" rel="L13964">when all these things shall be answered for. I denounce them to Heaven</li>
<li class="L13965" rel="L13965">and to earth.”</li>
<li class="L13966" rel="L13966"></li>
<li class="L13967" rel="L13967">A terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done. A</li>
<li class="L13968" rel="L13968">sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but</li>
<li class="L13969" rel="L13969">blood. The narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time,</li>
<li class="L13970" rel="L13970">and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it.</li>
<li class="L13971" rel="L13971"></li>
<li class="L13972" rel="L13972">Little need, in presence of that tribunal and that auditory, to show</li>
<li class="L13973" rel="L13973">how the Defarges had not made the paper public, with the other captured</li>
<li class="L13974" rel="L13974">Bastille memorials borne in procession, and had kept it, biding their</li>
<li class="L13975" rel="L13975">time. Little need to show that this detested family name had long been</li>
<li class="L13976" rel="L13976">anathematised by Saint Antoine, and was wrought into the fatal register.</li>
<li class="L13977" rel="L13977">The man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have</li>
<li class="L13978" rel="L13978">sustained him in that place that day, against such denunciation.</li>
<li class="L13979" rel="L13979"></li>
<li class="L13980" rel="L13980">And all the worse for the doomed man, that the denouncer was a</li>
<li class="L13981" rel="L13981">well-known citizen, his own attached friend, the father of his wife. One</li>
<li class="L13982" rel="L13982">of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was, for imitations of</li>
<li class="L13983" rel="L13983">the questionable public virtues of antiquity, and for sacrifices and</li>
<li class="L13984" rel="L13984">self-immolations on the people&#39;s altar. Therefore when the President</li>
<li class="L13985" rel="L13985">said (else had his own head quivered on his shoulders), that the good</li>
<li class="L13986" rel="L13986">physician of the Republic would deserve better still of the Republic by</li>
<li class="L13987" rel="L13987">rooting out an obnoxious family of Aristocrats, and would doubtless feel</li>
<li class="L13988" rel="L13988">a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and her child an</li>
<li class="L13989" rel="L13989">orphan, there was wild excitement, patriotic fervour, not a touch of</li>
<li class="L13990" rel="L13990">human sympathy.</li>
<li class="L13991" rel="L13991"></li>
<li class="L13992" rel="L13992">“Much influence around him, has that Doctor?” murmured Madame Defarge,</li>
<li class="L13993" rel="L13993">smiling to The Vengeance. “Save him now, my Doctor, save him!”</li>
<li class="L13994" rel="L13994"></li>
<li class="L13995" rel="L13995">At every juryman&#39;s vote, there was a roar. Another and another. Roar and</li>
<li class="L13996" rel="L13996">roar.</li>
<li class="L13997" rel="L13997"></li>
<li class="L13998" rel="L13998">Unanimously voted. At heart and by descent an Aristocrat, an enemy</li>
<li class="L13999" rel="L13999">of the Republic, a notorious oppressor of the People. Back to the</li>

<li class="L14007" rel="L14007"></li>
<li class="L14008" rel="L14008">The wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die, fell under</li>
<li class="L14009" rel="L14009">the sentence, as if she had been mortally stricken. But, she uttered no</li>
<li class="L14010" rel="L14010">sound; and so strong was the voice within her, representing that it was</li>
<li class="L14011" rel="L14011">she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment</li>
<li class="L14012" rel="L14012">it, that it quickly raised her, even from that shock.</li>
<li class="L14013" rel="L14013"></li>
<li class="L14014" rel="L14014">The Judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of doors,</li>
<li class="L14015" rel="L14015">the Tribunal adjourned. The quick noise and movement of the court&#39;s</li>
<li class="L14016" rel="L14016">emptying itself by many passages had not ceased, when Lucie stood</li>
<li class="L14017" rel="L14017">stretching out her arms towards her husband, with nothing in her face</li>
<li class="L14018" rel="L14018">but love and consolation.</li>
<li class="L14019" rel="L14019"></li>
<li class="L14020" rel="L14020">“If I might touch him! If I might embrace him once! O, good citizens, if</li>
<li class="L14021" rel="L14021">you would have so much compassion for us!”</li>
<li class="L14022" rel="L14022"></li>
<li class="L14023" rel="L14023">There was but a gaoler left, along with two of the four men who had</li>
<li class="L14024" rel="L14024">taken him last night, and Barsad. The people had all poured out to the</li>
<li class="L14025" rel="L14025">show in the streets. Barsad proposed to the rest, “Let her embrace</li>
<li class="L14026" rel="L14026">him then; it is but a moment.” It was silently acquiesced in, and they</li>
<li class="L14027" rel="L14027">passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place, where he, by</li>
<li class="L14028" rel="L14028">leaning over the dock, could fold her in his arms.</li>
<li class="L14029" rel="L14029"></li>
<li class="L14030" rel="L14030">“Farewell, dear darling of my soul. My parting blessing on my love. We</li>
<li class="L14031" rel="L14031">shall meet again, where the weary are at rest!”</li>
<li class="L14032" rel="L14032"></li>
<li class="L14033" rel="L14033">They were her husband&#39;s words, as he held her to his bosom.</li>
<li class="L14034" rel="L14034"></li>
<li class="L14035" rel="L14035">“I can bear it, dear Charles. I am supported from above: don&#39;t suffer</li>
<li class="L14036" rel="L14036">for me. A parting blessing for our child.”</li>
<li class="L14037" rel="L14037"></li>
<li class="L14038" rel="L14038">“I send it to her by you. I kiss her by you. I say farewell to her by</li>
<li class="L14039" rel="L14039">you.”</li>
<li class="L14040" rel="L14040"></li>
<li class="L14041" rel="L14041">“My husband. No! A moment!” He was tearing himself apart from her.</li>
<li class="L14042" rel="L14042">“We shall not be separated long. I feel that this will break my heart</li>
<li class="L14043" rel="L14043">by-and-bye; but I will do my duty while I can, and when I leave her, God</li>
<li class="L14044" rel="L14044">will raise up friends for her, as He did for me.”</li>
<li class="L14045" rel="L14045"></li>
<li class="L14046" rel="L14046">Her father had followed her, and would have fallen on his knees to both</li>
<li class="L14047" rel="L14047">of them, but that Darnay put out a hand and seized him, crying:</li>
<li class="L14048" rel="L14048"></li>
<li class="L14049" rel="L14049">“No, no! What have you done, what have you done, that you should kneel</li>
<li class="L14050" rel="L14050">to us! We know now, what a struggle you made of old. We know, now what</li>
<li class="L14051" rel="L14051">you underwent when you suspected my descent, and when you knew it. We</li>
<li class="L14052" rel="L14052">know now, the natural antipathy you strove against, and conquered, for</li>
<li class="L14053" rel="L14053">her dear sake. We thank you with all our hearts, and all our love and</li>
<li class="L14054" rel="L14054">duty. Heaven be with you!”</li>
<li class="L14055" rel="L14055"></li>
<li class="L14056" rel="L14056">Her father&#39;s only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair,</li>
<li class="L14057" rel="L14057">and wring them with a shriek of anguish.</li>
<li class="L14058" rel="L14058"></li>
<li class="L14059" rel="L14059">“It could not be otherwise,” said the prisoner. “All things have worked</li>
<li class="L14060" rel="L14060">together as they have fallen out. It was the always-vain endeavour to</li>
<li class="L14061" rel="L14061">discharge my poor mother&#39;s trust that first brought my fatal presence</li>
<li class="L14062" rel="L14062">near you. Good could never come of such evil, a happier end was not in</li>
<li class="L14063" rel="L14063">nature to so unhappy a beginning. Be comforted, and forgive me. Heaven</li>
<li class="L14064" rel="L14064">bless you!”</li>
<li class="L14065" rel="L14065"></li>
<li class="L14066" rel="L14066">As he was drawn away, his wife released him, and stood looking after him</li>
<li class="L14067" rel="L14067">with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer, and</li>
<li class="L14068" rel="L14068">with a radiant look upon her face, in which there was even a comforting</li>
<li class="L14069" rel="L14069">smile. As he went out at the prisoners&#39; door, she turned, laid her head</li>
<li class="L14070" rel="L14070">lovingly on her father&#39;s breast, tried to speak to him, and fell at his</li>
<li class="L14071" rel="L14071">feet.</li>
<li class="L14072" rel="L14072"></li>
<li class="L14073" rel="L14073">Then, issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved,</li>
<li class="L14074" rel="L14074">Sydney Carton came and took her up. Only her father and Mr. Lorry were</li>
<li class="L14075" rel="L14075">with her. His arm trembled as it raised her, and supported her head.</li>
<li class="L14076" rel="L14076">Yet, there was an air about him that was not all of pity--that had a</li>
<li class="L14077" rel="L14077">flush of pride in it.</li>
<li class="L14078" rel="L14078"></li>
<li class="L14079" rel="L14079">“Shall I take her to a coach? I shall never feel her weight.”</li>
<li class="L14080" rel="L14080"></li>
<li class="L14081" rel="L14081">He carried her lightly to the door, and laid her tenderly down in a</li>
<li class="L14082" rel="L14082">coach. Her father and their old friend got into it, and he took his seat</li>
<li class="L14083" rel="L14083">beside the driver.</li>
<li class="L14084" rel="L14084"></li>
<li class="L14085" rel="L14085">When they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not</li>
<li class="L14086" rel="L14086">many hours before, to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of</li>
<li class="L14087" rel="L14087">the street her feet had trodden, he lifted her again, and carried her up</li>
<li class="L14088" rel="L14088">the staircase to their rooms. There, he laid her down on a couch, where</li>
<li class="L14089" rel="L14089">her child and Miss Pross wept over her.</li>
<li class="L14090" rel="L14090"></li>
<li class="L14091" rel="L14091">“Don&#39;t recall her to herself,” he said, softly, to the latter, “she is</li>
<li class="L14092" rel="L14092">better so. Don&#39;t revive her to consciousness, while she only faints.”</li>
<li class="L14093" rel="L14093"></li>
<li class="L14094" rel="L14094">“Oh, Carton, Carton, dear Carton!” cried little Lucie, springing up and</li>
<li class="L14095" rel="L14095">throwing her arms passionately round him, in a burst of grief. “Now that</li>
<li class="L14096" rel="L14096">you have come, I think you will do something to help mamma, something to</li>
<li class="L14097" rel="L14097">save papa! O, look at her, dear Carton! Can you, of all the people who</li>
<li class="L14098" rel="L14098">love her, bear to see her so?”</li>
<li class="L14099" rel="L14099"></li>
<li class="L14100" rel="L14100">He bent over the child, and laid her blooming cheek against his face. He</li>
<li class="L14101" rel="L14101">put her gently from him, and looked at her unconscious mother.</li>
<li class="L14102" rel="L14102"></li>
<li class="L14103" rel="L14103">“Before I go,” he said, and paused--“I may kiss her?”</li>
<li class="L14104" rel="L14104"></li>
<li class="L14105" rel="L14105">It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face</li>
<li class="L14106" rel="L14106">with his lips, he murmured some words. The child, who was nearest to</li>
<li class="L14107" rel="L14107">him, told them afterwards, and told her grandchildren when she was a</li>
<li class="L14108" rel="L14108">handsome old lady, that she heard him say, “A life you love.”</li>
<li class="L14109" rel="L14109"></li>
<li class="L14110" rel="L14110">When he had gone out into the next room, he turned suddenly on Mr. Lorry</li>
<li class="L14111" rel="L14111">and her father, who were following, and said to the latter:</li>
<li class="L14112" rel="L14112"></li>
<li class="L14113" rel="L14113">“You had great influence but yesterday, Doctor Manette; let it at least</li>
<li class="L14114" rel="L14114">be tried. These judges, and all the men in power, are very friendly to</li>
<li class="L14115" rel="L14115">you, and very recognisant of your services; are they not?”</li>
<li class="L14116" rel="L14116"></li>
<li class="L14117" rel="L14117">“Nothing connected with Charles was concealed from me. I had the</li>
<li class="L14118" rel="L14118">strongest assurances that I should save him; and I did.” He returned the</li>
<li class="L14119" rel="L14119">answer in great trouble, and very slowly.</li>
<li class="L14120" rel="L14120"></li>
<li class="L14121" rel="L14121">“Try them again. The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon are few</li>
<li class="L14122" rel="L14122">and short, but try.”</li>
<li class="L14123" rel="L14123"></li>
<li class="L14124" rel="L14124">“I intend to try. I will not rest a moment.”</li>
<li class="L14125" rel="L14125"></li>
<li class="L14126" rel="L14126">“That&#39;s well. I have known such energy as yours do great things before</li>
<li class="L14127" rel="L14127">now--though never,” he added, with a smile and a sigh together, “such</li>
<li class="L14128" rel="L14128">great things as this. But try! Of little worth as life is when we misuse</li>
<li class="L14129" rel="L14129">it, it is worth that effort. It would cost nothing to lay down if it</li>
<li class="L14130" rel="L14130">were not.”</li>
<li class="L14131" rel="L14131"></li>
<li class="L14132" rel="L14132">“I will go,” said Doctor Manette, “to the Prosecutor and the President</li>
<li class="L14133" rel="L14133">straight, and I will go to others whom it is better not to name. I will</li>
<li class="L14134" rel="L14134">write too, and--But stay! There is a Celebration in the streets, and no</li>
<li class="L14135" rel="L14135">one will be accessible until dark.”</li>
<li class="L14136" rel="L14136"></li>
<li class="L14137" rel="L14137">“That&#39;s true. Well! It is a forlorn hope at the best, and not much the</li>
<li class="L14138" rel="L14138">forlorner for being delayed till dark. I should like to know how you</li>
<li class="L14139" rel="L14139">speed; though, mind! I expect nothing! When are you likely to have seen</li>
<li class="L14140" rel="L14140">these dread powers, Doctor Manette?”</li>
<li class="L14141" rel="L14141"></li>
<li class="L14142" rel="L14142">“Immediately after dark, I should hope. Within an hour or two from</li>
<li class="L14143" rel="L14143">this.”</li>
<li class="L14144" rel="L14144"></li>
<li class="L14145" rel="L14145">“It will be dark soon after four. Let us stretch the hour or two. If I</li>
<li class="L14146" rel="L14146">go to Mr. Lorry&#39;s at nine, shall I hear what you have done, either from</li>
<li class="L14147" rel="L14147">our friend or from yourself?”</li>
<li class="L14148" rel="L14148"></li>
<li class="L14149" rel="L14149">“Yes.”</li>
<li class="L14150" rel="L14150"></li>
<li class="L14151" rel="L14151">“May you prosper!”</li>
<li class="L14152" rel="L14152"></li>
<li class="L14153" rel="L14153">Mr. Lorry followed Sydney to the outer door, and, touching him on the</li>
<li class="L14154" rel="L14154">shoulder as he was going away, caused him to turn.</li>
<li class="L14155" rel="L14155"></li>
<li class="L14156" rel="L14156">“I have no hope,” said Mr. Lorry, in a low and sorrowful whisper.</li>
<li class="L14157" rel="L14157"></li>
<li class="L14158" rel="L14158">“Nor have I.”</li>
<li class="L14159" rel="L14159"></li>
<li class="L14160" rel="L14160">“If any one of these men, or all of these men, were disposed to spare</li>
<li class="L14161" rel="L14161">him--which is a large supposition; for what is his life, or any man&#39;s</li>
<li class="L14162" rel="L14162">to them!--I doubt if they durst spare him after the demonstration in the</li>
<li class="L14163" rel="L14163">court.”</li>
<li class="L14164" rel="L14164"></li>
<li class="L14165" rel="L14165">“And so do I. I heard the fall of the axe in that sound.”</li>
<li class="L14166" rel="L14166"></li>
<li class="L14167" rel="L14167">Mr. Lorry leaned his arm upon the door-post, and bowed his face upon it.</li>
<li class="L14168" rel="L14168"></li>
<li class="L14169" rel="L14169">“Don&#39;t despond,” said Carton, very gently; “don&#39;t grieve. I encouraged</li>
<li class="L14170" rel="L14170">Doctor Manette in this idea, because I felt that it might one day be</li>
<li class="L14171" rel="L14171">consolatory to her. Otherwise, she might think &#39;his life was wantonly</li>
<li class="L14172" rel="L14172">thrown away or wasted,&#39; and that might trouble her.”</li>
<li class="L14173" rel="L14173"></li>
<li class="L14174" rel="L14174">“Yes, yes, yes,” returned Mr. Lorry, drying his eyes, “you are right.</li>
<li class="L14175" rel="L14175">But he will perish; there is no real hope.”</li>
<li class="L14176" rel="L14176"></li>
<li class="L14177" rel="L14177">“Yes. He will perish: there is no real hope,” echoed Carton.</li>
<li class="L14178" rel="L14178"></li>
<li class="L14179" rel="L14179">And walked with a settled step, down-stairs.</li>
<li class="L14180" rel="L14180"></li>
<li class="L14181" rel="L14181"></li>
<li class="L14182" rel="L14182"></li>
<li class="L14183" rel="L14183"></li>
<li class="L14184" rel="L14184">XII. Darkness</li>
<li class="L14185" rel="L14185"></li>
<li class="L14186" rel="L14186"></li>
<li class="L14187" rel="L14187">Sydney Carton paused in the street, not quite decided where to go. “At</li>
<li class="L14188" rel="L14188">Tellson&#39;s banking-house at nine,” he said, with a musing face. “Shall I</li>
<li class="L14189" rel="L14189">do well, in the mean time, to show myself? I think so. It is best that</li>
<li class="L14190" rel="L14190">these people should know there is such a man as I here; it is a sound</li>
<li class="L14191" rel="L14191">precaution, and may be a necessary preparation. But care, care, care!</li>
<li class="L14192" rel="L14192">Let me think it out!”</li>
<li class="L14193" rel="L14193"></li>
<li class="L14194" rel="L14194">Checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object, he took a</li>
<li class="L14195" rel="L14195">turn or two in the already darkening street, and traced the thought</li>
<li class="L14196" rel="L14196">in his mind to its possible consequences. His first impression was</li>
<li class="L14197" rel="L14197">confirmed. “It is best,” he said, finally resolved, “that these people</li>
<li class="L14198" rel="L14198">should know there is such a man as I here.” And he turned his face</li>
<li class="L14199" rel="L14199">towards Saint Antoine.</li>
<li class="L14200" rel="L14200"></li>
<li class="L14201" rel="L14201">Defarge had described himself, that day, as the keeper of a wine-shop in</li>
<li class="L14202" rel="L14202">the Saint Antoine suburb. It was not difficult for one who knew the city</li>
<li class="L14203" rel="L14203">well, to find his house without asking any question. Having ascertained</li>
<li class="L14204" rel="L14204">its situation, Carton came out of those closer streets again, and dined</li>
<li class="L14205" rel="L14205">at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner. For the</li>
<li class="L14206" rel="L14206">first time in many years, he had no strong drink. Since last night he</li>
<li class="L14207" rel="L14207">had taken nothing but a little light thin wine, and last night he had</li>
<li class="L14208" rel="L14208">dropped the brandy slowly down on Mr. Lorry&#39;s hearth like a man who had</li>
<li class="L14209" rel="L14209">done with it.</li>
<li class="L14210" rel="L14210"></li>
<li class="L14211" rel="L14211">It was as late as seven o&#39;clock when he awoke refreshed, and went out</li>
<li class="L14212" rel="L14212">into the streets again. As he passed along towards Saint Antoine, he</li>
<li class="L14213" rel="L14213">stopped at a shop-window where there was a mirror, and slightly altered</li>
<li class="L14214" rel="L14214">the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat, and his coat-collar, and</li>
<li class="L14215" rel="L14215">his wild hair. This done, he went on direct to Defarge&#39;s, and went in.</li>
<li class="L14216" rel="L14216"></li>
<li class="L14217" rel="L14217">There happened to be no customer in the shop but Jacques Three, of the</li>
<li class="L14218" rel="L14218">restless fingers and the croaking voice. This man, whom he had seen upon</li>
<li class="L14219" rel="L14219">the Jury, stood drinking at the little counter, in conversation with the</li>
<li class="L14220" rel="L14220">Defarges, man and wife. The Vengeance assisted in the conversation, like</li>
<li class="L14221" rel="L14221">a regular member of the establishment.</li>
<li class="L14222" rel="L14222"></li>
<li class="L14223" rel="L14223">As Carton walked in, took his seat and asked (in very indifferent</li>
<li class="L14224" rel="L14224">French) for a small measure of wine, Madame Defarge cast a careless</li>
<li class="L14225" rel="L14225">glance at him, and then a keener, and then a keener, and then advanced</li>
<li class="L14226" rel="L14226">to him herself, and asked him what it was he had ordered.</li>
<li class="L14227" rel="L14227"></li>
<li class="L14228" rel="L14228">He repeated what he had already said.</li>
<li class="L14229" rel="L14229"></li>
<li class="L14230" rel="L14230">“English?” asked Madame Defarge, inquisitively raising her dark</li>
<li class="L14231" rel="L14231">eyebrows.</li>
<li class="L14232" rel="L14232"></li>
<li class="L14233" rel="L14233">After looking at her, as if the sound of even a single French word were</li>
<li class="L14234" rel="L14234">slow to express itself to him, he answered, in his former strong foreign</li>
<li class="L14235" rel="L14235">accent. “Yes, madame, yes. I am English!”</li>
<li class="L14236" rel="L14236"></li>
<li class="L14237" rel="L14237">Madame Defarge returned to her counter to get the wine, and, as he</li>
<li class="L14238" rel="L14238">took up a Jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its</li>
<li class="L14239" rel="L14239">meaning, he heard her say, “I swear to you, like Evremonde!”</li>
<li class="L14240" rel="L14240"></li>
<li class="L14241" rel="L14241">Defarge brought him the wine, and gave him Good Evening.</li>
<li class="L14242" rel="L14242"></li>
<li class="L14243" rel="L14243">“How?”</li>
<li class="L14244" rel="L14244"></li>
<li class="L14245" rel="L14245">“Good evening.”</li>
<li class="L14246" rel="L14246"></li>
<li class="L14247" rel="L14247">“Oh! Good evening, citizen,” filling his glass. “Ah! and good wine. I</li>
<li class="L14248" rel="L14248">drink to the Republic.”</li>
<li class="L14249" rel="L14249"></li>
<li class="L14250" rel="L14250">Defarge went back to the counter, and said, “Certainly, a little like.”</li>
<li class="L14251" rel="L14251"> Madame sternly retorted, “I tell you a good deal like.” Jacques Three</li>
<li class="L14252" rel="L14252">pacifically remarked, “He is so much in your mind, see you, madame.”</li>
<li class="L14253" rel="L14253"> The amiable Vengeance added, with a laugh, “Yes, my faith! And you</li>
<li class="L14254" rel="L14254">are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more</li>
<li class="L14255" rel="L14255">to-morrow!”</li>
<li class="L14256" rel="L14256"></li>
<li class="L14257" rel="L14257">Carton followed the lines and words of his paper, with a slow</li>
<li class="L14258" rel="L14258">forefinger, and with a studious and absorbed face. They were all leaning</li>
<li class="L14259" rel="L14259">their arms on the counter close together, speaking low. After a silence</li>
<li class="L14260" rel="L14260">of a few moments, during which they all looked towards him without</li>
<li class="L14261" rel="L14261">disturbing his outward attention from the Jacobin editor, they resumed</li>
<li class="L14262" rel="L14262">their conversation.</li>
<li class="L14263" rel="L14263"></li>
<li class="L14264" rel="L14264">“It is true what madame says,” observed Jacques Three. “Why stop? There</li>
<li class="L14265" rel="L14265">is great force in that. Why stop?”</li>
<li class="L14266" rel="L14266"></li>
<li class="L14267" rel="L14267">“Well, well,” reasoned Defarge, “but one must stop somewhere. After all,</li>
<li class="L14268" rel="L14268">the question is still where?”</li>
<li class="L14269" rel="L14269"></li>
<li class="L14270" rel="L14270">“At extermination,” said madame.</li>
<li class="L14271" rel="L14271"></li>
<li class="L14272" rel="L14272">“Magnificent!” croaked Jacques Three. The Vengeance, also, highly</li>
<li class="L14273" rel="L14273">approved.</li>
<li class="L14274" rel="L14274"></li>
<li class="L14275" rel="L14275">“Extermination is good doctrine, my wife,” said Defarge, rather</li>
<li class="L14276" rel="L14276">troubled; “in general, I say nothing against it. But this Doctor has</li>
<li class="L14277" rel="L14277">suffered much; you have seen him to-day; you have observed his face when</li>
<li class="L14278" rel="L14278">the paper was read.”</li>
<li class="L14279" rel="L14279"></li>
<li class="L14280" rel="L14280">“I have observed his face!” repeated madame, contemptuously and angrily.</li>
<li class="L14281" rel="L14281">“Yes. I have observed his face. I have observed his face to be not the</li>
<li class="L14282" rel="L14282">face of a true friend of the Republic. Let him take care of his face!”</li>
<li class="L14283" rel="L14283"></li>
<li class="L14284" rel="L14284">“And you have observed, my wife,” said Defarge, in a deprecatory manner,</li>
<li class="L14285" rel="L14285">“the anguish of his daughter, which must be a dreadful anguish to him!”</li>
<li class="L14286" rel="L14286"></li>
<li class="L14287" rel="L14287">“I have observed his daughter,” repeated madame; “yes, I have observed</li>
<li class="L14288" rel="L14288">his daughter, more times than one. I have observed her to-day, and I</li>
<li class="L14289" rel="L14289">have observed her other days. I have observed her in the court, and</li>
<li class="L14290" rel="L14290">I have observed her in the street by the prison. Let me but lift my</li>
<li class="L14291" rel="L14291">finger--!” She seemed to raise it (the listener&#39;s eyes were always on</li>
<li class="L14292" rel="L14292">his paper), and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her, as</li>
<li class="L14293" rel="L14293">if the axe had dropped.</li>
<li class="L14294" rel="L14294"></li>
<li class="L14295" rel="L14295">“The citizeness is superb!” croaked the Juryman.</li>
<li class="L14296" rel="L14296"></li>
<li class="L14297" rel="L14297">“She is an Angel!” said The Vengeance, and embraced her.</li>
<li class="L14298" rel="L14298"></li>
<li class="L14299" rel="L14299">“As to thee,” pursued madame, implacably, addressing her husband, “if it</li>
<li class="L14300" rel="L14300">depended on thee--which, happily, it does not--thou wouldst rescue this</li>
<li class="L14301" rel="L14301">man even now.”</li>
<li class="L14302" rel="L14302"></li>
<li class="L14303" rel="L14303">“No!” protested Defarge. “Not if to lift this glass would do it! But I</li>
<li class="L14304" rel="L14304">would leave the matter there. I say, stop there.”</li>
<li class="L14305" rel="L14305"></li>
<li class="L14306" rel="L14306">“See you then, Jacques,” said Madame Defarge, wrathfully; “and see you,</li>
<li class="L14307" rel="L14307">too, my little Vengeance; see you both! Listen! For other crimes as</li>
<li class="L14308" rel="L14308">tyrants and oppressors, I have this race a long time on my register,</li>
<li class="L14309" rel="L14309">doomed to destruction and extermination. Ask my husband, is that so.”</li>
<li class="L14310" rel="L14310"></li>
<li class="L14311" rel="L14311">“It is so,” assented Defarge, without being asked.</li>
<li class="L14312" rel="L14312"></li>
<li class="L14313" rel="L14313">“In the beginning of the great days, when the Bastille falls, he finds</li>
<li class="L14314" rel="L14314">this paper of to-day, and he brings it home, and in the middle of the</li>
<li class="L14315" rel="L14315">night when this place is clear and shut, we read it, here on this spot,</li>
<li class="L14316" rel="L14316">by the light of this lamp. Ask him, is that so.”</li>
<li class="L14317" rel="L14317"></li>
<li class="L14318" rel="L14318">“It is so,” assented Defarge.</li>
<li class="L14319" rel="L14319"></li>
<li class="L14320" rel="L14320">“That night, I tell him, when the paper is read through, and the lamp is</li>
<li class="L14321" rel="L14321">burnt out, and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and between</li>
<li class="L14322" rel="L14322">those iron bars, that I have now a secret to communicate. Ask him, is</li>
<li class="L14323" rel="L14323">that so.”</li>
<li class="L14324" rel="L14324"></li>
<li class="L14325" rel="L14325">“It is so,” assented Defarge again.</li>
<li class="L14326" rel="L14326"></li>
<li class="L14327" rel="L14327">“I communicate to him that secret. I smite this bosom with these two</li>
<li class="L14328" rel="L14328">hands as I smite it now, and I tell him, &#39;Defarge, I was brought up</li>
<li class="L14329" rel="L14329">among the fishermen of the sea-shore, and that peasant family so injured</li>
<li class="L14330" rel="L14330">by the two Evremonde brothers, as that Bastille paper describes, is my</li>
<li class="L14331" rel="L14331">family. Defarge, that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground</li>
<li class="L14332" rel="L14332">was my sister, that husband was my sister&#39;s husband, that unborn child</li>
<li class="L14333" rel="L14333">was their child, that brother was my brother, that father was my father,</li>
<li class="L14334" rel="L14334">those dead are my dead, and that summons to answer for those things</li>
<li class="L14335" rel="L14335">descends to me!&#39; Ask him, is that so.”</li>
<li class="L14336" rel="L14336"></li>
<li class="L14337" rel="L14337">“It is so,” assented Defarge once more.</li>
<li class="L14338" rel="L14338"></li>
<li class="L14339" rel="L14339">“Then tell Wind and Fire where to stop,” returned madame; “but don&#39;t</li>
<li class="L14340" rel="L14340">tell me.”</li>
<li class="L14341" rel="L14341"></li>
<li class="L14342" rel="L14342">Both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature</li>
<li class="L14343" rel="L14343">of her wrath--the listener could feel how white she was, without seeing</li>
<li class="L14344" rel="L14344">her--and both highly commended it. Defarge, a weak minority, interposed</li>
<li class="L14345" rel="L14345">a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the Marquis; but</li>
<li class="L14346" rel="L14346">only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply. “Tell</li>
<li class="L14347" rel="L14347">the Wind and the Fire where to stop; not me!”</li>
<li class="L14348" rel="L14348"></li>
<li class="L14349" rel="L14349">Customers entered, and the group was broken up. The English customer</li>
<li class="L14350" rel="L14350">paid for what he had had, perplexedly counted his change, and asked, as</li>
<li class="L14351" rel="L14351">a stranger, to be directed towards the National Palace. Madame Defarge</li>
<li class="L14352" rel="L14352">took him to the door, and put her arm on his, in pointing out the road.</li>
<li class="L14353" rel="L14353">The English customer was not without his reflections then, that it might</li>
<li class="L14354" rel="L14354">be a good deed to seize that arm, lift it, and strike under it sharp and</li>
<li class="L14355" rel="L14355">deep.</li>
<li class="L14356" rel="L14356"></li>
<li class="L14357" rel="L14357">But, he went his way, and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the</li>
<li class="L14358" rel="L14358">prison wall. At the appointed hour, he emerged from it to present</li>
<li class="L14359" rel="L14359">himself in Mr. Lorry&#39;s room again, where he found the old gentleman</li>
<li class="L14360" rel="L14360">walking to and fro in restless anxiety. He said he had been with Lucie</li>
<li class="L14361" rel="L14361">until just now, and had only left her for a few minutes, to come and</li>
<li class="L14362" rel="L14362">keep his appointment. Her father had not been seen, since he quitted the</li>
<li class="L14363" rel="L14363">banking-house towards four o&#39;clock. She had some faint hopes that his</li>
<li class="L14364" rel="L14364">mediation might save Charles, but they were very slight. He had been</li>
<li class="L14365" rel="L14365">more than five hours gone: where could he be?</li>
<li class="L14366" rel="L14366"></li>
<li class="L14367" rel="L14367">Mr. Lorry waited until ten; but, Doctor Manette not returning, and</li>
<li class="L14368" rel="L14368">he being unwilling to leave Lucie any longer, it was arranged that he</li>
<li class="L14369" rel="L14369">should go back to her, and come to the banking-house again at midnight.</li>
<li class="L14370" rel="L14370">In the meanwhile, Carton would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor.</li>
<li class="L14371" rel="L14371"></li>
<li class="L14372" rel="L14372">He waited and waited, and the clock struck twelve; but Doctor Manette</li>
<li class="L14373" rel="L14373">did not come back. Mr. Lorry returned, and found no tidings of him, and</li>
<li class="L14374" rel="L14374">brought none. Where could he be?</li>
<li class="L14375" rel="L14375"></li>
<li class="L14376" rel="L14376">They were discussing this question, and were almost building up some</li>
<li class="L14377" rel="L14377">weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence, when they heard him on</li>
<li class="L14378" rel="L14378">the stairs. The instant he entered the room, it was plain that all was</li>
<li class="L14379" rel="L14379">lost.</li>
<li class="L14380" rel="L14380"></li>
<li class="L14381" rel="L14381">Whether he had really been to any one, or whether he had been all that</li>
<li class="L14382" rel="L14382">time traversing the streets, was never known. As he stood staring at</li>
<li class="L14383" rel="L14383">them, they asked him no question, for his face told them everything.</li>
<li class="L14384" rel="L14384"></li>
<li class="L14385" rel="L14385">“I cannot find it,” said he, “and I must have it. Where is it?”</li>
<li class="L14386" rel="L14386"></li>
<li class="L14387" rel="L14387">His head and throat were bare, and, as he spoke with a helpless look</li>
<li class="L14388" rel="L14388">straying all around, he took his coat off, and let it drop on the floor.</li>
<li class="L14389" rel="L14389"></li>
<li class="L14390" rel="L14390">“Where is my bench? I have been looking everywhere for my bench, and I</li>
<li class="L14391" rel="L14391">can&#39;t find it. What have they done with my work? Time presses: I must</li>
<li class="L14392" rel="L14392">finish those shoes.”</li>
<li class="L14393" rel="L14393"></li>
<li class="L14394" rel="L14394">They looked at one another, and their hearts died within them.</li>
<li class="L14395" rel="L14395"></li>
<li class="L14396" rel="L14396">“Come, come!” said he, in a whimpering miserable way; “let me get to</li>
<li class="L14397" rel="L14397">work. Give me my work.”</li>
<li class="L14398" rel="L14398"></li>
<li class="L14399" rel="L14399">Receiving no answer, he tore his hair, and beat his feet upon the</li>
<li class="L14400" rel="L14400">ground, like a distracted child.</li>
<li class="L14401" rel="L14401"></li>
<li class="L14402" rel="L14402">“Don&#39;t torture a poor forlorn wretch,” he implored them, with a dreadful</li>
<li class="L14403" rel="L14403">cry; “but give me my work! What is to become of us, if those shoes are</li>
<li class="L14404" rel="L14404">not done to-night?”</li>
<li class="L14405" rel="L14405"></li>
<li class="L14406" rel="L14406">Lost, utterly lost!</li>
<li class="L14407" rel="L14407"></li>
<li class="L14408" rel="L14408">It was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him, or try to restore him,</li>
<li class="L14409" rel="L14409">that--as if by agreement--they each put a hand upon his shoulder, and</li>
<li class="L14410" rel="L14410">soothed him to sit down before the fire, with a promise that he should</li>
<li class="L14411" rel="L14411">have his work presently. He sank into the chair, and brooded over the</li>
<li class="L14412" rel="L14412">embers, and shed tears. As if all that had happened since the garret</li>
<li class="L14413" rel="L14413">time were a momentary fancy, or a dream, Mr. Lorry saw him shrink into</li>
<li class="L14414" rel="L14414">the exact figure that Defarge had had in keeping.</li>
<li class="L14415" rel="L14415"></li>
<li class="L14416" rel="L14416">Affected, and impressed with terror as they both were, by this spectacle</li>
<li class="L14417" rel="L14417">of ruin, it was not a time to yield to such emotions. His lonely</li>
<li class="L14418" rel="L14418">daughter, bereft of her final hope and reliance, appealed to them both</li>
<li class="L14419" rel="L14419">too strongly. Again, as if by agreement, they looked at one another with</li>
<li class="L14420" rel="L14420">one meaning in their faces. Carton was the first to speak:</li>
<li class="L14421" rel="L14421"></li>
<li class="L14422" rel="L14422">“The last chance is gone: it was not much. Yes; he had better be taken</li>
<li class="L14423" rel="L14423">to her. But, before you go, will you, for a moment, steadily attend to</li>
<li class="L14424" rel="L14424">me? Don&#39;t ask me why I make the stipulations I am going to make, and</li>
<li class="L14425" rel="L14425">exact the promise I am going to exact; I have a reason--a good one.”</li>
<li class="L14426" rel="L14426"></li>
<li class="L14427" rel="L14427">“I do not doubt it,” answered Mr. Lorry. “Say on.”</li>
<li class="L14428" rel="L14428"></li>
<li class="L14429" rel="L14429">The figure in the chair between them, was all the time monotonously</li>
<li class="L14430" rel="L14430">rocking itself to and fro, and moaning. They spoke in such a tone as</li>
<li class="L14431" rel="L14431">they would have used if they had been watching by a sick-bed in the</li>
<li class="L14432" rel="L14432">night.</li>
<li class="L14433" rel="L14433"></li>
<li class="L14434" rel="L14434">Carton stooped to pick up the coat, which lay almost entangling his</li>
<li class="L14435" rel="L14435">feet. As he did so, a small case in which the Doctor was accustomed to</li>
<li class="L14436" rel="L14436">carry the lists of his day&#39;s duties, fell lightly on the floor. Carton</li>
<li class="L14437" rel="L14437">took it up, and there was a folded paper in it. “We should look</li>
<li class="L14438" rel="L14438">at this!” he said. Mr. Lorry nodded his consent. He opened it, and</li>
<li class="L14439" rel="L14439">exclaimed, “Thank _God!_”</li>
<li class="L14440" rel="L14440"></li>
<li class="L14441" rel="L14441">“What is it?” asked Mr. Lorry, eagerly.</li>
<li class="L14442" rel="L14442"></li>
<li class="L14443" rel="L14443">“A moment! Let me speak of it in its place. First,” he put his hand in</li>
<li class="L14444" rel="L14444">his coat, and took another paper from it, “that is the certificate which</li>
<li class="L14445" rel="L14445">enables me to pass out of this city. Look at it. You see--Sydney Carton,</li>
<li class="L14446" rel="L14446">an Englishman?”</li>
<li class="L14447" rel="L14447"></li>
<li class="L14448" rel="L14448">Mr. Lorry held it open in his hand, gazing in his earnest face.</li>
<li class="L14449" rel="L14449"></li>
<li class="L14450" rel="L14450">“Keep it for me until to-morrow. I shall see him to-morrow, you</li>
<li class="L14451" rel="L14451">remember, and I had better not take it into the prison.”</li>
<li class="L14452" rel="L14452"></li>
<li class="L14453" rel="L14453">“Why not?”</li>
<li class="L14454" rel="L14454"></li>
<li class="L14455" rel="L14455">“I don&#39;t know; I prefer not to do so. Now, take this paper that Doctor</li>
<li class="L14456" rel="L14456">Manette has carried about him. It is a similar certificate, enabling him</li>
<li class="L14457" rel="L14457">and his daughter and her child, at any time, to pass the barrier and the</li>
<li class="L14458" rel="L14458">frontier! You see?”</li>
<li class="L14459" rel="L14459"></li>
<li class="L14460" rel="L14460">“Yes!”</li>
<li class="L14461" rel="L14461"></li>
<li class="L14462" rel="L14462">“Perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil,</li>
<li class="L14463" rel="L14463">yesterday. When is it dated? But no matter; don&#39;t stay to look; put it</li>
<li class="L14464" rel="L14464">up carefully with mine and your own. Now, observe! I never doubted until</li>
<li class="L14465" rel="L14465">within this hour or two, that he had, or could have such a paper. It is</li>
<li class="L14466" rel="L14466">good, until recalled. But it may be soon recalled, and, I have reason to</li>
<li class="L14467" rel="L14467">think, will be.”</li>
<li class="L14468" rel="L14468"></li>
<li class="L14469" rel="L14469">“They are not in danger?”</li>
<li class="L14470" rel="L14470"></li>
<li class="L14471" rel="L14471">“They are in great danger. They are in danger of denunciation by Madame</li>
<li class="L14472" rel="L14472">Defarge. I know it from her own lips. I have overheard words of that</li>
<li class="L14473" rel="L14473">woman&#39;s, to-night, which have presented their danger to me in strong</li>
<li class="L14474" rel="L14474">colours. I have lost no time, and since then, I have seen the spy. He</li>
<li class="L14475" rel="L14475">confirms me. He knows that a wood-sawyer, living by the prison wall,</li>
<li class="L14476" rel="L14476">is under the control of the Defarges, and has been rehearsed by</li>
<li class="L14477" rel="L14477">Madame Defarge as to his having seen Her”--he never mentioned Lucie&#39;s</li>
<li class="L14478" rel="L14478">name--“making signs and signals to prisoners. It is easy to foresee that</li>
<li class="L14479" rel="L14479">the pretence will be the common one, a prison plot, and that it will</li>
<li class="L14480" rel="L14480">involve her life--and perhaps her child&#39;s--and perhaps her father&#39;s--for</li>
<li class="L14481" rel="L14481">both have been seen with her at that place. Don&#39;t look so horrified. You</li>
<li class="L14482" rel="L14482">will save them all.”</li>
<li class="L14483" rel="L14483"></li>
<li class="L14484" rel="L14484">“Heaven grant I may, Carton! But how?”</li>
<li class="L14485" rel="L14485"></li>
<li class="L14486" rel="L14486">“I am going to tell you how. It will depend on you, and it could depend</li>
<li class="L14487" rel="L14487">on no better man. This new denunciation will certainly not take place</li>
<li class="L14488" rel="L14488">until after to-morrow; probably not until two or three days afterwards;</li>
<li class="L14489" rel="L14489">more probably a week afterwards. You know it is a capital crime, to</li>
<li class="L14490" rel="L14490">mourn for, or sympathise with, a victim of the Guillotine. She and her</li>
<li class="L14491" rel="L14491">father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime, and this woman (the</li>
<li class="L14492" rel="L14492">inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot be described) would wait to add that</li>
<li class="L14493" rel="L14493">strength to her case, and make herself doubly sure. You follow me?”</li>
<li class="L14494" rel="L14494"></li>
<li class="L14495" rel="L14495">“So attentively, and with so much confidence in what you say, that for</li>
<li class="L14496" rel="L14496">the moment I lose sight,” touching the back of the Doctor&#39;s chair, “even</li>
<li class="L14497" rel="L14497">of this distress.”</li>
<li class="L14498" rel="L14498"></li>
<li class="L14499" rel="L14499">“You have money, and can buy the means of travelling to the seacoast</li>
<li class="L14500" rel="L14500">as quickly as the journey can be made. Your preparations have been</li>
<li class="L14501" rel="L14501">completed for some days, to return to England. Early to-morrow have your</li>
<li class="L14502" rel="L14502">horses ready, so that they may be in starting trim at two o&#39;clock in the</li>
<li class="L14503" rel="L14503">afternoon.”</li>
<li class="L14504" rel="L14504"></li>
<li class="L14505" rel="L14505">“It shall be done!”</li>
<li class="L14506" rel="L14506"></li>
<li class="L14507" rel="L14507">His manner was so fervent and inspiring, that Mr. Lorry caught the</li>
<li class="L14508" rel="L14508">flame, and was as quick as youth.</li>
<li class="L14509" rel="L14509"></li>
<li class="L14510" rel="L14510">“You are a noble heart. Did I say we could depend upon no better man?</li>
<li class="L14511" rel="L14511">Tell her, to-night, what you know of her danger as involving her child</li>
<li class="L14512" rel="L14512">and her father. Dwell upon that, for she would lay her own fair head</li>
<li class="L14513" rel="L14513">beside her husband&#39;s cheerfully.” He faltered for an instant; then went</li>
<li class="L14514" rel="L14514">on as before. “For the sake of her child and her father, press upon her</li>
<li class="L14515" rel="L14515">the necessity of leaving Paris, with them and you, at that hour. Tell</li>
<li class="L14516" rel="L14516">her that it was her husband&#39;s last arrangement. Tell her that more</li>
<li class="L14517" rel="L14517">depends upon it than she dare believe, or hope. You think that her</li>
<li class="L14518" rel="L14518">father, even in this sad state, will submit himself to her; do you not?”</li>
<li class="L14519" rel="L14519"></li>
<li class="L14520" rel="L14520">“I am sure of it.”</li>
<li class="L14521" rel="L14521"></li>
<li class="L14522" rel="L14522">“I thought so. Quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made in</li>
<li class="L14523" rel="L14523">the courtyard here, even to the taking of your own seat in the carriage.</li>
<li class="L14524" rel="L14524">The moment I come to you, take me in, and drive away.”</li>
<li class="L14525" rel="L14525"></li>
<li class="L14526" rel="L14526">“I understand that I wait for you under all circumstances?”</li>
<li class="L14527" rel="L14527"></li>
<li class="L14528" rel="L14528">“You have my certificate in your hand with the rest, you know, and will</li>
<li class="L14529" rel="L14529">reserve my place. Wait for nothing but to have my place occupied, and</li>
<li class="L14530" rel="L14530">then for England!”</li>
<li class="L14531" rel="L14531"></li>
<li class="L14532" rel="L14532">“Why, then,” said Mr. Lorry, grasping his eager but so firm and steady</li>
<li class="L14533" rel="L14533">hand, “it does not all depend on one old man, but I shall have a young</li>
<li class="L14534" rel="L14534">and ardent man at my side.”</li>
<li class="L14535" rel="L14535"></li>
<li class="L14536" rel="L14536">“By the help of Heaven you shall! Promise me solemnly that nothing will</li>
<li class="L14537" rel="L14537">influence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledged to one</li>
<li class="L14538" rel="L14538">another.”</li>
<li class="L14539" rel="L14539"></li>
<li class="L14540" rel="L14540">“Nothing, Carton.”</li>
<li class="L14541" rel="L14541"></li>
<li class="L14542" rel="L14542">“Remember these words to-morrow: change the course, or delay in it--for</li>
<li class="L14543" rel="L14543">any reason--and no life can possibly be saved, and many lives must</li>
<li class="L14544" rel="L14544">inevitably be sacrificed.”</li>
<li class="L14545" rel="L14545"></li>
<li class="L14546" rel="L14546">“I will remember them. I hope to do my part faithfully.”</li>
<li class="L14547" rel="L14547"></li>
<li class="L14548" rel="L14548">“And I hope to do mine. Now, good bye!”</li>
<li class="L14549" rel="L14549"></li>
<li class="L14550" rel="L14550">Though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness, and though he even</li>
<li class="L14551" rel="L14551">put the old man&#39;s hand to his lips, he did not part from him then. He</li>
<li class="L14552" rel="L14552">helped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying embers,</li>
<li class="L14553" rel="L14553">as to get a cloak and hat put upon it, and to tempt it forth to find</li>
<li class="L14554" rel="L14554">where the bench and work were hidden that it still moaningly besought</li>
<li class="L14555" rel="L14555">to have. He walked on the other side of it and protected it to the</li>
<li class="L14556" rel="L14556">courtyard of the house where the afflicted heart--so happy in</li>
<li class="L14557" rel="L14557">the memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to</li>
<li class="L14558" rel="L14558">it--outwatched the awful night. He entered the courtyard and remained</li>
<li class="L14559" rel="L14559">there for a few moments alone, looking up at the light in the window of</li>
<li class="L14560" rel="L14560">her room. Before he went away, he breathed a blessing towards it, and a</li>
<li class="L14561" rel="L14561">Farewell.</li>
<li class="L14562" rel="L14562"></li>
<li class="L14563" rel="L14563"></li>

<li class="L14568" rel="L14568"></li>
<li class="L14569" rel="L14569">In the black prison of the Conciergerie, the doomed of the day awaited</li>
<li class="L14570" rel="L14570">their fate. They were in number as the weeks of the year. Fifty-two were</li>
<li class="L14571" rel="L14571">to roll that afternoon on the life-tide of the city to the boundless</li>
<li class="L14572" rel="L14572">everlasting sea. Before their cells were quit of them, new occupants</li>
<li class="L14573" rel="L14573">were appointed; before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday,</li>
<li class="L14574" rel="L14574">the blood that was to mingle with theirs to-morrow was already set</li>
<li class="L14575" rel="L14575">apart.</li>
<li class="L14576" rel="L14576"></li>
<li class="L14577" rel="L14577">Two score and twelve were told off. From the farmer-general of seventy,</li>
<li class="L14578" rel="L14578">whose riches could not buy his life, to the seamstress of twenty, whose</li>
<li class="L14579" rel="L14579">poverty and obscurity could not save her. Physical diseases, engendered</li>
<li class="L14580" rel="L14580">in the vices and neglects of men, will seize on victims of all degrees;</li>
<li class="L14581" rel="L14581">and the frightful moral disorder, born of unspeakable suffering,</li>
<li class="L14582" rel="L14582">intolerable oppression, and heartless indifference, smote equally</li>
<li class="L14583" rel="L14583">without distinction.</li>
<li class="L14584" rel="L14584"></li>
<li class="L14585" rel="L14585">Charles Darnay, alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no</li>
<li class="L14586" rel="L14586">flattering delusion since he came to it from the Tribunal. In every line</li>
<li class="L14587" rel="L14587">of the narrative he had heard, he had heard his condemnation. He had</li>
<li class="L14588" rel="L14588">fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him,</li>
<li class="L14589" rel="L14589">that he was virtually sentenced by the millions, and that units could</li>
<li class="L14590" rel="L14590">avail him nothing.</li>
<li class="L14591" rel="L14591"></li>
<li class="L14592" rel="L14592">Nevertheless, it was not easy, with the face of his beloved wife fresh</li>
<li class="L14593" rel="L14593">before him, to compose his mind to what it must bear. His hold on life</li>
<li class="L14594" rel="L14594">was strong, and it was very, very hard, to loosen; by gradual efforts</li>
<li class="L14595" rel="L14595">and degrees unclosed a little here, it clenched the tighter there; and</li>
<li class="L14596" rel="L14596">when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded,</li>
<li class="L14597" rel="L14597">this was closed again. There was a hurry, too, in all his thoughts,</li>
<li class="L14598" rel="L14598">a turbulent and heated working of his heart, that contended against</li>
<li class="L14599" rel="L14599">resignation. If, for a moment, he did feel resigned, then his wife and</li>
<li class="L14600" rel="L14600">child who had to live after him, seemed to protest and to make it a</li>
<li class="L14601" rel="L14601">selfish thing.</li>
<li class="L14602" rel="L14602"></li>
<li class="L14603" rel="L14603">But, all this was at first. Before long, the consideration that there</li>
<li class="L14604" rel="L14604">was no disgrace in the fate he must meet, and that numbers went the same</li>
<li class="L14605" rel="L14605">road wrongfully, and trod it firmly every day, sprang up to stimulate</li>
<li class="L14606" rel="L14606">him. Next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind</li>
<li class="L14607" rel="L14607">enjoyable by the dear ones, depended on his quiet fortitude. So,</li>
<li class="L14608" rel="L14608">by degrees he calmed into the better state, when he could raise his</li>
<li class="L14609" rel="L14609">thoughts much higher, and draw comfort down.</li>
<li class="L14610" rel="L14610"></li>
<li class="L14611" rel="L14611">Before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation, he had</li>
<li class="L14612" rel="L14612">travelled thus far on his last way. Being allowed to purchase the means</li>
<li class="L14613" rel="L14613">of writing, and a light, he sat down to write until such time as the</li>
<li class="L14614" rel="L14614">prison lamps should be extinguished.</li>
<li class="L14615" rel="L14615"></li>
<li class="L14616" rel="L14616">He wrote a long letter to Lucie, showing her that he had known nothing</li>
<li class="L14617" rel="L14617">of her father&#39;s imprisonment, until he had heard of it from herself,</li>
<li class="L14618" rel="L14618">and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father&#39;s and uncle&#39;s</li>
<li class="L14619" rel="L14619">responsibility for that misery, until the paper had been read. He had</li>
<li class="L14620" rel="L14620">already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name</li>
<li class="L14621" rel="L14621">he had relinquished, was the one condition--fully intelligible now--that</li>
<li class="L14622" rel="L14622">her father had attached to their betrothal, and was the one promise he</li>
<li class="L14623" rel="L14623">had still exacted on the morning of their marriage. He entreated her,</li>
<li class="L14624" rel="L14624">for her father&#39;s sake, never to seek to know whether her father had</li>
<li class="L14625" rel="L14625">become oblivious of the existence of the paper, or had had it recalled</li>
<li class="L14626" rel="L14626">to him (for the moment, or for good), by the story of the Tower, on</li>
<li class="L14627" rel="L14627">that old Sunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden. If he had</li>
<li class="L14628" rel="L14628">preserved any definite remembrance of it, there could be no doubt that</li>
<li class="L14629" rel="L14629">he had supposed it destroyed with the Bastille, when he had found no</li>
<li class="L14630" rel="L14630">mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had</li>
<li class="L14631" rel="L14631">discovered there, and which had been described to all the world. He</li>
<li class="L14632" rel="L14632">besought her--though he added that he knew it was needless--to console</li>
<li class="L14633" rel="L14633">her father, by impressing him through every tender means she could think</li>
<li class="L14634" rel="L14634">of, with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly</li>
<li class="L14635" rel="L14635">reproach himself, but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint</li>
<li class="L14636" rel="L14636">sakes. Next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and</li>
<li class="L14637" rel="L14637">blessing, and her overcoming of her sorrow, to devote herself to their</li>
<li class="L14638" rel="L14638">dear child, he adjured her, as they would meet in Heaven, to comfort her</li>
<li class="L14639" rel="L14639">father.</li>
<li class="L14640" rel="L14640"></li>
<li class="L14641" rel="L14641">To her father himself, he wrote in the same strain; but, he told her</li>
<li class="L14642" rel="L14642">father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care. And</li>
<li class="L14643" rel="L14643">he told him this, very strongly, with the hope of rousing him from any</li>
<li class="L14644" rel="L14644">despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be</li>
<li class="L14645" rel="L14645">tending.</li>
<li class="L14646" rel="L14646"></li>
<li class="L14647" rel="L14647">To Mr. Lorry, he commended them all, and explained his worldly affairs.</li>
<li class="L14648" rel="L14648">That done, with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm</li>
<li class="L14649" rel="L14649">attachment, all was done. He never thought of Carton. His mind was so</li>
<li class="L14650" rel="L14650">full of the others, that he never once thought of him.</li>
<li class="L14651" rel="L14651"></li>
<li class="L14652" rel="L14652">He had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out. When</li>
<li class="L14653" rel="L14653">he lay down on his straw bed, he thought he had done with this world.</li>
<li class="L14654" rel="L14654"></li>
<li class="L14655" rel="L14655">But, it beckoned him back in his sleep, and showed itself in shining</li>
<li class="L14656" rel="L14656">forms. Free and happy, back in the old house in Soho (though it had</li>
<li class="L14657" rel="L14657">nothing in it like the real house), unaccountably released and light of</li>
<li class="L14658" rel="L14658">heart, he was with Lucie again, and she told him it was all a dream, and</li>
<li class="L14659" rel="L14659">he had never gone away. A pause of forgetfulness, and then he had even</li>
<li class="L14660" rel="L14660">suffered, and had come back to her, dead and at peace, and yet there</li>
<li class="L14661" rel="L14661">was no difference in him. Another pause of oblivion, and he awoke in the</li>
<li class="L14662" rel="L14662">sombre morning, unconscious where he was or what had happened, until it</li>
<li class="L14663" rel="L14663">flashed upon his mind, “this is the day of my death!”</li>
<li class="L14664" rel="L14664"></li>
<li class="L14665" rel="L14665">Thus, had he come through the hours, to the day when the fifty-two heads</li>
<li class="L14666" rel="L14666">were to fall. And now, while he was composed, and hoped that he could</li>
<li class="L14667" rel="L14667">meet the end with quiet heroism, a new action began in his waking</li>
<li class="L14668" rel="L14668">thoughts, which was very difficult to master.</li>
<li class="L14669" rel="L14669"></li>
<li class="L14670" rel="L14670">He had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life. How</li>
<li class="L14671" rel="L14671">high it was from the ground, how many steps it had, where he would be</li>
<li class="L14672" rel="L14672">stood, how he would be touched, whether the touching hands would be dyed</li>
<li class="L14673" rel="L14673">red, which way his face would be turned, whether he would be the first,</li>
<li class="L14674" rel="L14674">or might be the last: these and many similar questions, in nowise</li>
<li class="L14675" rel="L14675">directed by his will, obtruded themselves over and over again, countless</li>
<li class="L14676" rel="L14676">times. Neither were they connected with fear: he was conscious of no</li>
<li class="L14677" rel="L14677">fear. Rather, they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what</li>
<li class="L14678" rel="L14678">to do when the time came; a desire gigantically disproportionate to the</li>
<li class="L14679" rel="L14679">few swift moments to which it referred; a wondering that was more like</li>
<li class="L14680" rel="L14680">the wondering of some other spirit within his, than his own.</li>
<li class="L14681" rel="L14681"></li>
<li class="L14682" rel="L14682">The hours went on as he walked to and fro, and the clocks struck the</li>
<li class="L14683" rel="L14683">numbers he would never hear again. Nine gone for ever, ten gone for</li>
<li class="L14684" rel="L14684">ever, eleven gone for ever, twelve coming on to pass away. After a hard</li>
<li class="L14685" rel="L14685">contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed</li>
<li class="L14686" rel="L14686">him, he had got the better of it. He walked up and down, softly</li>
<li class="L14687" rel="L14687">repeating their names to himself. The worst of the strife was over.</li>
<li class="L14688" rel="L14688">He could walk up and down, free from distracting fancies, praying for</li>
<li class="L14689" rel="L14689">himself and for them.</li>
<li class="L14690" rel="L14690"></li>
<li class="L14691" rel="L14691">Twelve gone for ever.</li>
<li class="L14692" rel="L14692"></li>
<li class="L14693" rel="L14693">He had been apprised that the final hour was Three, and he knew he would</li>
<li class="L14694" rel="L14694">be summoned some time earlier, inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily</li>
<li class="L14695" rel="L14695">and slowly through the streets. Therefore, he resolved to keep Two</li>
<li class="L14696" rel="L14696">before his mind, as the hour, and so to strengthen himself in the</li>
<li class="L14697" rel="L14697">interval that he might be able, after that time, to strengthen others.</li>
<li class="L14698" rel="L14698"></li>
<li class="L14699" rel="L14699">Walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast, a very</li>
<li class="L14700" rel="L14700">different man from the prisoner, who had walked to and fro at La Force,</li>
<li class="L14701" rel="L14701">he heard One struck away from him, without surprise. The hour had</li>
<li class="L14702" rel="L14702">measured like most other hours. Devoutly thankful to Heaven for his</li>
<li class="L14703" rel="L14703">recovered self-possession, he thought, “There is but another now,” and</li>
<li class="L14704" rel="L14704">turned to walk again.</li>
<li class="L14705" rel="L14705"></li>
<li class="L14706" rel="L14706">Footsteps in the stone passage outside the door. He stopped.</li>
<li class="L14707" rel="L14707"></li>
<li class="L14708" rel="L14708">The key was put in the lock, and turned. Before the door was opened, or</li>
<li class="L14709" rel="L14709">as it opened, a man said in a low voice, in English: “He has never seen</li>
<li class="L14710" rel="L14710">me here; I have kept out of his way. Go you in alone; I wait near. Lose</li>
<li class="L14711" rel="L14711">no time!”</li>
<li class="L14712" rel="L14712"></li>
<li class="L14713" rel="L14713">The door was quickly opened and closed, and there stood before him</li>
<li class="L14714" rel="L14714">face to face, quiet, intent upon him, with the light of a smile on his</li>
<li class="L14715" rel="L14715">features, and a cautionary finger on his lip, Sydney Carton.</li>
<li class="L14716" rel="L14716"></li>
<li class="L14717" rel="L14717">There was something so bright and remarkable in his look, that, for the</li>
<li class="L14718" rel="L14718">first moment, the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of his own</li>
<li class="L14719" rel="L14719">imagining. But, he spoke, and it was his voice; he took the prisoner&#39;s</li>
<li class="L14720" rel="L14720">hand, and it was his real grasp.</li>
<li class="L14721" rel="L14721"></li>
<li class="L14722" rel="L14722">“Of all the people upon earth, you least expected to see me?” he said.</li>
<li class="L14723" rel="L14723"></li>
<li class="L14724" rel="L14724">“I could not believe it to be you. I can scarcely believe it now. You</li>
<li class="L14725" rel="L14725">are not”--the apprehension came suddenly into his mind--“a prisoner?”</li>
<li class="L14726" rel="L14726"></li>
<li class="L14727" rel="L14727">“No. I am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers</li>
<li class="L14728" rel="L14728">here, and in virtue of it I stand before you. I come from her--your</li>
<li class="L14729" rel="L14729">wife, dear Darnay.”</li>
<li class="L14730" rel="L14730"></li>
<li class="L14731" rel="L14731">The prisoner wrung his hand.</li>
<li class="L14732" rel="L14732"></li>
<li class="L14733" rel="L14733">“I bring you a request from her.”</li>
<li class="L14734" rel="L14734"></li>
<li class="L14735" rel="L14735">“What is it?”</li>
<li class="L14736" rel="L14736"></li>
<li class="L14737" rel="L14737">“A most earnest, pressing, and emphatic entreaty, addressed to you</li>
<li class="L14738" rel="L14738">in the most pathetic tones of the voice so dear to you, that you well</li>
<li class="L14739" rel="L14739">remember.”</li>
<li class="L14740" rel="L14740"></li>
<li class="L14741" rel="L14741">The prisoner turned his face partly aside.</li>
<li class="L14742" rel="L14742"></li>
<li class="L14743" rel="L14743">“You have no time to ask me why I bring it, or what it means; I have</li>
<li class="L14744" rel="L14744">no time to tell you. You must comply with it--take off those boots you</li>
<li class="L14745" rel="L14745">wear, and draw on these of mine.”</li>
<li class="L14746" rel="L14746"></li>
<li class="L14747" rel="L14747">There was a chair against the wall of the cell, behind the prisoner.</li>
<li class="L14748" rel="L14748">Carton, pressing forward, had already, with the speed of lightning, got</li>
<li class="L14749" rel="L14749">him down into it, and stood over him, barefoot.</li>
<li class="L14750" rel="L14750"></li>
<li class="L14751" rel="L14751">“Draw on these boots of mine. Put your hands to them; put your will to</li>
<li class="L14752" rel="L14752">them. Quick!”</li>
<li class="L14753" rel="L14753"></li>
<li class="L14754" rel="L14754">“Carton, there is no escaping from this place; it never can be done. You</li>
<li class="L14755" rel="L14755">will only die with me. It is madness.”</li>
<li class="L14756" rel="L14756"></li>
<li class="L14757" rel="L14757">“It would be madness if I asked you to escape; but do I? When I ask you</li>
<li class="L14758" rel="L14758">to pass out at that door, tell me it is madness and remain here. Change</li>
<li class="L14759" rel="L14759">that cravat for this of mine, that coat for this of mine. While you do</li>
<li class="L14760" rel="L14760">it, let me take this ribbon from your hair, and shake out your hair like</li>
<li class="L14761" rel="L14761">this of mine!”</li>
<li class="L14762" rel="L14762"></li>
<li class="L14763" rel="L14763">With wonderful quickness, and with a strength both of will and action,</li>
<li class="L14764" rel="L14764">that appeared quite supernatural, he forced all these changes upon him.</li>
<li class="L14765" rel="L14765">The prisoner was like a young child in his hands.</li>
<li class="L14766" rel="L14766"></li>
<li class="L14767" rel="L14767">“Carton! Dear Carton! It is madness. It cannot be accomplished, it never</li>
<li class="L14768" rel="L14768">can be done, it has been attempted, and has always failed. I implore you</li>
<li class="L14769" rel="L14769">not to add your death to the bitterness of mine.”</li>
<li class="L14770" rel="L14770"></li>
<li class="L14771" rel="L14771">“Do I ask you, my dear Darnay, to pass the door? When I ask that,</li>
<li class="L14772" rel="L14772">refuse. There are pen and ink and paper on this table. Is your hand</li>
<li class="L14773" rel="L14773">steady enough to write?”</li>
<li class="L14774" rel="L14774"></li>
<li class="L14775" rel="L14775">“It was when you came in.”</li>
<li class="L14776" rel="L14776"></li>
<li class="L14777" rel="L14777">“Steady it again, and write what I shall dictate. Quick, friend, quick!”</li>
<li class="L14778" rel="L14778"></li>
<li class="L14779" rel="L14779">Pressing his hand to his bewildered head, Darnay sat down at the table.</li>
<li class="L14780" rel="L14780">Carton, with his right hand in his breast, stood close beside him.</li>
<li class="L14781" rel="L14781"></li>
<li class="L14782" rel="L14782">“Write exactly as I speak.”</li>
<li class="L14783" rel="L14783"></li>
<li class="L14784" rel="L14784">“To whom do I address it?”</li>
<li class="L14785" rel="L14785"></li>
<li class="L14786" rel="L14786">“To no one.” Carton still had his hand in his breast.</li>
<li class="L14787" rel="L14787"></li>
<li class="L14788" rel="L14788">“Do I date it?”</li>
<li class="L14789" rel="L14789"></li>
<li class="L14790" rel="L14790">“No.”</li>
<li class="L14791" rel="L14791"></li>
<li class="L14792" rel="L14792">The prisoner looked up, at each question. Carton, standing over him with</li>
<li class="L14793" rel="L14793">his hand in his breast, looked down.</li>
<li class="L14794" rel="L14794"></li>
<li class="L14795" rel="L14795">“&#39;If you remember,&#39;” said Carton, dictating, “&#39;the words that passed</li>
<li class="L14796" rel="L14796">between us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when you see it.</li>
<li class="L14797" rel="L14797">You do remember them, I know. It is not in your nature to forget them.&#39;”</li>
<li class="L14798" rel="L14798"></li>
<li class="L14799" rel="L14799">He was drawing his hand from his breast; the prisoner chancing to look</li>
<li class="L14800" rel="L14800">up in his hurried wonder as he wrote, the hand stopped, closing upon</li>
<li class="L14801" rel="L14801">something.</li>
<li class="L14802" rel="L14802"></li>
<li class="L14803" rel="L14803">“Have you written &#39;forget them&#39;?” Carton asked.</li>
<li class="L14804" rel="L14804"></li>
<li class="L14805" rel="L14805">“I have. Is that a weapon in your hand?”</li>
<li class="L14806" rel="L14806"></li>
<li class="L14807" rel="L14807">“No; I am not armed.”</li>
<li class="L14808" rel="L14808"></li>
<li class="L14809" rel="L14809">“What is it in your hand?”</li>
<li class="L14810" rel="L14810"></li>
<li class="L14811" rel="L14811">“You shall know directly. Write on; there are but a few words more.” He</li>
<li class="L14812" rel="L14812">dictated again. “&#39;I am thankful that the time has come, when I can prove</li>
<li class="L14813" rel="L14813">them. That I do so is no subject for regret or grief.&#39;” As he said these</li>
<li class="L14814" rel="L14814">words with his eyes fixed on the writer, his hand slowly and softly</li>
<li class="L14815" rel="L14815">moved down close to the writer&#39;s face.</li>
<li class="L14816" rel="L14816"></li>
<li class="L14817" rel="L14817">The pen dropped from Darnay&#39;s fingers on the table, and he looked about</li>
<li class="L14818" rel="L14818">him vacantly.</li>
<li class="L14819" rel="L14819"></li>
<li class="L14820" rel="L14820">“What vapour is that?” he asked.</li>
<li class="L14821" rel="L14821"></li>
<li class="L14822" rel="L14822">“Vapour?”</li>
<li class="L14823" rel="L14823"></li>
<li class="L14824" rel="L14824">“Something that crossed me?”</li>
<li class="L14825" rel="L14825"></li>
<li class="L14826" rel="L14826">“I am conscious of nothing; there can be nothing here. Take up the pen</li>
<li class="L14827" rel="L14827">and finish. Hurry, hurry!”</li>
<li class="L14828" rel="L14828"></li>
<li class="L14829" rel="L14829">As if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the</li>
<li class="L14830" rel="L14830">prisoner made an effort to rally his attention. As he looked at Carton</li>
<li class="L14831" rel="L14831">with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton--his</li>
<li class="L14832" rel="L14832">hand again in his breast--looked steadily at him.</li>
<li class="L14833" rel="L14833"></li>
<li class="L14834" rel="L14834">“Hurry, hurry!”</li>
<li class="L14835" rel="L14835"></li>
<li class="L14836" rel="L14836">The prisoner bent over the paper, once more.</li>
<li class="L14837" rel="L14837"></li>
<li class="L14838" rel="L14838">“&#39;If it had been otherwise;&#39;” Carton&#39;s hand was again watchfully and</li>
<li class="L14839" rel="L14839">softly stealing down; “&#39;I never should have used the longer opportunity.</li>
<li class="L14840" rel="L14840">If it had been otherwise;&#39;” the hand was at the prisoner&#39;s face; “&#39;I</li>
<li class="L14841" rel="L14841">should but have had so much the more to answer for. If it had been</li>
<li class="L14842" rel="L14842">otherwise--&#39;” Carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into</li>
<li class="L14843" rel="L14843">unintelligible signs.</li>
<li class="L14844" rel="L14844"></li>
<li class="L14845" rel="L14845">Carton&#39;s hand moved back to his breast no more. The prisoner sprang up</li>
<li class="L14846" rel="L14846">with a reproachful look, but Carton&#39;s hand was close and firm at his</li>
<li class="L14847" rel="L14847">nostrils, and Carton&#39;s left arm caught him round the waist. For a few</li>
<li class="L14848" rel="L14848">seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his</li>
<li class="L14849" rel="L14849">life for him; but, within a minute or so, he was stretched insensible on</li>
<li class="L14850" rel="L14850">the ground.</li>
<li class="L14851" rel="L14851"></li>
<li class="L14852" rel="L14852">Quickly, but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was, Carton</li>
<li class="L14853" rel="L14853">dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside, combed back</li>
<li class="L14854" rel="L14854">his hair, and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn. Then, he</li>
<li class="L14855" rel="L14855">softly called, “Enter there! Come in!” and the Spy presented himself.</li>
<li class="L14856" rel="L14856"></li>
<li class="L14857" rel="L14857">“You see?” said Carton, looking up, as he kneeled on one knee beside the</li>
<li class="L14858" rel="L14858">insensible figure, putting the paper in the breast: “is your hazard very</li>
<li class="L14859" rel="L14859">great?”</li>
<li class="L14860" rel="L14860"></li>
<li class="L14861" rel="L14861">“Mr. Carton,” the Spy answered, with a timid snap of his fingers, “my</li>
<li class="L14862" rel="L14862">hazard is not _that_, in the thick of business here, if you are true to</li>
<li class="L14863" rel="L14863">the whole of your bargain.”</li>
<li class="L14864" rel="L14864"></li>
<li class="L14865" rel="L14865">“Don&#39;t fear me. I will be true to the death.”</li>
<li class="L14866" rel="L14866"></li>
<li class="L14867" rel="L14867">“You must be, Mr. Carton, if the tale of fifty-two is to be right. Being</li>
<li class="L14868" rel="L14868">made right by you in that dress, I shall have no fear.”</li>
<li class="L14869" rel="L14869"></li>
<li class="L14870" rel="L14870">“Have no fear! I shall soon be out of the way of harming you, and the</li>
<li class="L14871" rel="L14871">rest will soon be far from here, please God! Now, get assistance and</li>
<li class="L14872" rel="L14872">take me to the coach.”</li>
<li class="L14873" rel="L14873"></li>
<li class="L14874" rel="L14874">“You?” said the Spy nervously.</li>
<li class="L14875" rel="L14875"></li>
<li class="L14876" rel="L14876">“Him, man, with whom I have exchanged. You go out at the gate by which</li>
<li class="L14877" rel="L14877">you brought me in?”</li>
<li class="L14878" rel="L14878"></li>
<li class="L14879" rel="L14879">“Of course.”</li>
<li class="L14880" rel="L14880"></li>
<li class="L14881" rel="L14881">“I was weak and faint when you brought me in, and I am fainter now you</li>
<li class="L14882" rel="L14882">take me out. The parting interview has overpowered me. Such a thing has</li>
<li class="L14883" rel="L14883">happened here, often, and too often. Your life is in your own hands.</li>
<li class="L14884" rel="L14884">Quick! Call assistance!”</li>
<li class="L14885" rel="L14885"></li>
<li class="L14886" rel="L14886">“You swear not to betray me?” said the trembling Spy, as he paused for a</li>
<li class="L14887" rel="L14887">last moment.</li>
<li class="L14888" rel="L14888"></li>
<li class="L14889" rel="L14889">“Man, man!” returned Carton, stamping his foot; “have I sworn by no</li>
<li class="L14890" rel="L14890">solemn vow already, to go through with this, that you waste the precious</li>
<li class="L14891" rel="L14891">moments now? Take him yourself to the courtyard you know of, place</li>
<li class="L14892" rel="L14892">him yourself in the carriage, show him yourself to Mr. Lorry, tell him</li>
<li class="L14893" rel="L14893">yourself to give him no restorative but air, and to remember my words of</li>
<li class="L14894" rel="L14894">last night, and his promise of last night, and drive away!”</li>
<li class="L14895" rel="L14895"></li>
<li class="L14896" rel="L14896">The Spy withdrew, and Carton seated himself at the table, resting his</li>
<li class="L14897" rel="L14897">forehead on his hands. The Spy returned immediately, with two men.</li>
<li class="L14898" rel="L14898"></li>
<li class="L14899" rel="L14899">“How, then?” said one of them, contemplating the fallen figure. “So</li>
<li class="L14900" rel="L14900">afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of</li>
<li class="L14901" rel="L14901">Sainte Guillotine?”</li>
<li class="L14902" rel="L14902"></li>
<li class="L14903" rel="L14903">“A good patriot,” said the other, “could hardly have been more afflicted</li>
<li class="L14904" rel="L14904">if the Aristocrat had drawn a blank.”</li>
<li class="L14905" rel="L14905"></li>
<li class="L14906" rel="L14906">They raised the unconscious figure, placed it on a litter they had</li>
<li class="L14907" rel="L14907">brought to the door, and bent to carry it away.</li>
<li class="L14908" rel="L14908"></li>
<li class="L14909" rel="L14909">“The time is short, Evremonde,” said the Spy, in a warning voice.</li>
<li class="L14910" rel="L14910"></li>
<li class="L14911" rel="L14911">“I know it well,” answered Carton. “Be careful of my friend, I entreat</li>
<li class="L14912" rel="L14912">you, and leave me.”</li>
<li class="L14913" rel="L14913"></li>
<li class="L14914" rel="L14914">“Come, then, my children,” said Barsad. “Lift him, and come away!”</li>
<li class="L14915" rel="L14915"></li>
<li class="L14916" rel="L14916">The door closed, and Carton was left alone. Straining his powers of</li>
<li class="L14917" rel="L14917">listening to the utmost, he listened for any sound that might denote</li>
<li class="L14918" rel="L14918">suspicion or alarm. There was none. Keys turned, doors clashed,</li>
<li class="L14919" rel="L14919">footsteps passed along distant passages: no cry was raised, or hurry</li>
<li class="L14920" rel="L14920">made, that seemed unusual. Breathing more freely in a little while, he</li>
<li class="L14921" rel="L14921">sat down at the table, and listened again until the clock struck Two.</li>
<li class="L14922" rel="L14922"></li>
<li class="L14923" rel="L14923">Sounds that he was not afraid of, for he divined their meaning, then</li>
<li class="L14924" rel="L14924">began to be audible. Several doors were opened in succession, and</li>
<li class="L14925" rel="L14925">finally his own. A gaoler, with a list in his hand, looked in, merely</li>
<li class="L14926" rel="L14926">saying, “Follow me, Evremonde!” and he followed into a large dark room,</li>
<li class="L14927" rel="L14927">at a distance. It was a dark winter day, and what with the shadows</li>
<li class="L14928" rel="L14928">within, and what with the shadows without, he could but dimly discern</li>
<li class="L14929" rel="L14929">the others who were brought there to have their arms bound. Some were</li>
<li class="L14930" rel="L14930">standing; some seated. Some were lamenting, and in restless motion;</li>
<li class="L14931" rel="L14931">but, these were few. The great majority were silent and still, looking</li>
<li class="L14932" rel="L14932">fixedly at the ground.</li>
<li class="L14933" rel="L14933"></li>
<li class="L14934" rel="L14934">As he stood by the wall in a dim corner, while some of the fifty-two</li>
<li class="L14935" rel="L14935">were brought in after him, one man stopped in passing, to embrace him,</li>
<li class="L14936" rel="L14936">as having a knowledge of him. It thrilled him with a great dread of</li>
<li class="L14937" rel="L14937">discovery; but the man went on. A very few moments after that, a young</li>
<li class="L14938" rel="L14938">woman, with a slight girlish form, a sweet spare face in which there was</li>
<li class="L14939" rel="L14939">no vestige of colour, and large widely opened patient eyes, rose from</li>
<li class="L14940" rel="L14940">the seat where he had observed her sitting, and came to speak to him.</li>
<li class="L14941" rel="L14941"></li>
<li class="L14942" rel="L14942">“Citizen Evremonde,” she said, touching him with her cold hand. “I am a</li>
<li class="L14943" rel="L14943">poor little seamstress, who was with you in La Force.”</li>
<li class="L14944" rel="L14944"></li>
<li class="L14945" rel="L14945">He murmured for answer: “True. I forget what you were accused of?”</li>
<li class="L14946" rel="L14946"></li>
<li class="L14947" rel="L14947">“Plots. Though the just Heaven knows that I am innocent of any. Is it</li>
<li class="L14948" rel="L14948">likely? Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature</li>
<li class="L14949" rel="L14949">like me?”</li>
<li class="L14950" rel="L14950"></li>
<li class="L14951" rel="L14951">The forlorn smile with which she said it, so touched him, that tears</li>
<li class="L14952" rel="L14952">started from his eyes.</li>
<li class="L14953" rel="L14953"></li>
<li class="L14954" rel="L14954">“I am not afraid to die, Citizen Evremonde, but I have done nothing. I</li>
<li class="L14955" rel="L14955">am not unwilling to die, if the Republic which is to do so much good</li>
<li class="L14956" rel="L14956">to us poor, will profit by my death; but I do not know how that can be,</li>
<li class="L14957" rel="L14957">Citizen Evremonde. Such a poor weak little creature!”</li>
<li class="L14958" rel="L14958"></li>
<li class="L14959" rel="L14959">As the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to, it</li>
<li class="L14960" rel="L14960">warmed and softened to this pitiable girl.</li>
<li class="L14961" rel="L14961"></li>
<li class="L14962" rel="L14962">“I heard you were released, Citizen Evremonde. I hoped it was true?”</li>
<li class="L14963" rel="L14963"></li>
<li class="L14964" rel="L14964">“It was. But, I was again taken and condemned.”</li>
<li class="L14965" rel="L14965"></li>
<li class="L14966" rel="L14966">“If I may ride with you, Citizen Evremonde, will you let me hold your</li>
<li class="L14967" rel="L14967">hand? I am not afraid, but I am little and weak, and it will give me</li>
<li class="L14968" rel="L14968">more courage.”</li>
<li class="L14969" rel="L14969"></li>
<li class="L14970" rel="L14970">As the patient eyes were lifted to his face, he saw a sudden doubt in</li>
<li class="L14971" rel="L14971">them, and then astonishment. He pressed the work-worn, hunger-worn young</li>
<li class="L14972" rel="L14972">fingers, and touched his lips.</li>
<li class="L14973" rel="L14973"></li>
<li class="L14974" rel="L14974">“Are you dying for him?” she whispered.</li>
<li class="L14975" rel="L14975"></li>
<li class="L14976" rel="L14976">“And his wife and child. Hush! Yes.”</li>
<li class="L14977" rel="L14977"></li>
<li class="L14978" rel="L14978">“O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?”</li>
<li class="L14979" rel="L14979"></li>
<li class="L14980" rel="L14980">“Hush! Yes, my poor sister; to the last.”</li>
<li class="L14981" rel="L14981"></li>
<li class="L14982" rel="L14982">        *****</li>
<li class="L14983" rel="L14983"></li>
<li class="L14984" rel="L14984">The same shadows that are falling on the prison, are falling, in that</li>
<li class="L14985" rel="L14985">same hour of the early afternoon, on the Barrier with the crowd about</li>
<li class="L14986" rel="L14986">it, when a coach going out of Paris drives up to be examined.</li>
<li class="L14987" rel="L14987"></li>
<li class="L14988" rel="L14988">“Who goes here? Whom have we within? Papers!”</li>
<li class="L14989" rel="L14989"></li>
<li class="L14990" rel="L14990">The papers are handed out, and read.</li>

<li class="L14994" rel="L14994">This is he; this helpless, inarticulately murmuring, wandering old man</li>
<li class="L14995" rel="L14995">pointed out.</li>
<li class="L14996" rel="L14996"></li>
<li class="L14997" rel="L14997">“Apparently the Citizen-Doctor is not in his right mind? The</li>
<li class="L14998" rel="L14998">Revolution-fever will have been too much for him?”</li>
<li class="L14999" rel="L14999"></li>
<li class="L15000" rel="L15000">Greatly too much for him.</li>
<li class="L15001" rel="L15001"></li>
<li class="L15002" rel="L15002">“Hah! Many suffer with it. Lucie. His daughter. French. Which is she?”</li>
<li class="L15003" rel="L15003"></li>
<li class="L15004" rel="L15004">This is she.</li>
<li class="L15005" rel="L15005"></li>
<li class="L15006" rel="L15006">“Apparently it must be. Lucie, the wife of Evremonde; is it not?”</li>
<li class="L15007" rel="L15007"></li>
<li class="L15008" rel="L15008">It is.</li>
<li class="L15009" rel="L15009"></li>
<li class="L15010" rel="L15010">“Hah! Evremonde has an assignation elsewhere. Lucie, her child. English.</li>
<li class="L15011" rel="L15011">This is she?”</li>
<li class="L15012" rel="L15012"></li>
<li class="L15013" rel="L15013">She and no other.</li>
<li class="L15014" rel="L15014"></li>
<li class="L15015" rel="L15015">“Kiss me, child of Evremonde. Now, thou hast kissed a good Republican;</li>
<li class="L15016" rel="L15016">something new in thy family; remember it! Sydney Carton. Advocate.</li>
<li class="L15017" rel="L15017">English. Which is he?”</li>
<li class="L15018" rel="L15018"></li>
<li class="L15019" rel="L15019">He lies here, in this corner of the carriage. He, too, is pointed out.</li>

<li class="L15021" rel="L15021">“Apparently the English advocate is in a swoon?”</li>
<li class="L15022" rel="L15022"></li>
<li class="L15023" rel="L15023">It is hoped he will recover in the fresher air. It is represented that</li>
<li class="L15024" rel="L15024">he is not in strong health, and has separated sadly from a friend who is</li>

<li class="L15030" rel="L15030"></li>
<li class="L15031" rel="L15031">“I am he. Necessarily, being the last.”</li>
<li class="L15032" rel="L15032"></li>
<li class="L15033" rel="L15033">It is Jarvis Lorry who has replied to all the previous questions. It</li>
<li class="L15034" rel="L15034">is Jarvis Lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach</li>
<li class="L15035" rel="L15035">door, replying to a group of officials. They leisurely walk round the</li>
<li class="L15036" rel="L15036">carriage and leisurely mount the box, to look at what little luggage it</li>
<li class="L15037" rel="L15037">carries on the roof; the country-people hanging about, press nearer to</li>
<li class="L15038" rel="L15038">the coach doors and greedily stare in; a little child, carried by its</li>
<li class="L15039" rel="L15039">mother, has its short arm held out for it, that it may touch the wife of</li>
<li class="L15040" rel="L15040">an aristocrat who has gone to the Guillotine.</li>
<li class="L15041" rel="L15041"></li>
<li class="L15042" rel="L15042">“Behold your papers, Jarvis Lorry, countersigned.”</li>
<li class="L15043" rel="L15043"></li>
<li class="L15044" rel="L15044">“One can depart, citizen?”</li>
<li class="L15045" rel="L15045"></li>
<li class="L15046" rel="L15046">“One can depart. Forward, my postilions! A good journey!”</li>
<li class="L15047" rel="L15047"></li>
<li class="L15048" rel="L15048">“I salute you, citizens.--And the first danger passed!”</li>
<li class="L15049" rel="L15049"></li>
<li class="L15050" rel="L15050">These are again the words of Jarvis Lorry, as he clasps his hands, and</li>
<li class="L15051" rel="L15051">looks upward. There is terror in the carriage, there is weeping, there</li>
<li class="L15052" rel="L15052">is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller.</li>
<li class="L15053" rel="L15053"></li>
<li class="L15054" rel="L15054">“Are we not going too slowly? Can they not be induced to go faster?”</li>
<li class="L15055" rel="L15055"> asks Lucie, clinging to the old man.</li>
<li class="L15056" rel="L15056"></li>
<li class="L15057" rel="L15057">“It would seem like flight, my darling. I must not urge them too much;</li>

<li class="L15062" rel="L15062">“The road is clear, my dearest. So far, we are not pursued.”</li>
<li class="L15063" rel="L15063"></li>
<li class="L15064" rel="L15064">Houses in twos and threes pass by us, solitary farms, ruinous buildings,</li>
<li class="L15065" rel="L15065">dye-works, tanneries, and the like, open country, avenues of leafless</li>
<li class="L15066" rel="L15066">trees. The hard uneven pavement is under us, the soft deep mud is on</li>
<li class="L15067" rel="L15067">either side. Sometimes, we strike into the skirting mud, to avoid the</li>
<li class="L15068" rel="L15068">stones that clatter us and shake us; sometimes, we stick in ruts and</li>
<li class="L15069" rel="L15069">sloughs there. The agony of our impatience is then so great, that in our</li>
<li class="L15070" rel="L15070">wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and running--hiding--doing</li>
<li class="L15071" rel="L15071">anything but stopping.</li>
<li class="L15072" rel="L15072"></li>
<li class="L15073" rel="L15073">Out of the open country, in again among ruinous buildings, solitary</li>
<li class="L15074" rel="L15074">farms, dye-works, tanneries, and the like, cottages in twos and threes,</li>
<li class="L15075" rel="L15075">avenues of leafless trees. Have these men deceived us, and taken us back</li>
<li class="L15076" rel="L15076">by another road? Is not this the same place twice over? Thank Heaven,</li>
<li class="L15077" rel="L15077">no. A village. Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued! Hush!</li>
<li class="L15078" rel="L15078">the posting-house.</li>
<li class="L15079" rel="L15079"></li>
<li class="L15080" rel="L15080">Leisurely, our four horses are taken out; leisurely, the coach stands in</li>
<li class="L15081" rel="L15081">the little street, bereft of horses, and with no likelihood upon it</li>
<li class="L15082" rel="L15082">of ever moving again; leisurely, the new horses come into visible</li>
<li class="L15083" rel="L15083">existence, one by one; leisurely, the new postilions follow, sucking and</li>
<li class="L15084" rel="L15084">plaiting the lashes of their whips; leisurely, the old postilions count</li>
<li class="L15085" rel="L15085">their money, make wrong additions, and arrive at dissatisfied results.</li>
<li class="L15086" rel="L15086">All the time, our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would</li>
<li class="L15087" rel="L15087">far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled.</li>
<li class="L15088" rel="L15088"></li>
<li class="L15089" rel="L15089">At length the new postilions are in their saddles, and the old are left</li>
<li class="L15090" rel="L15090">behind. We are through the village, up the hill, and down the hill, and</li>
<li class="L15091" rel="L15091">on the low watery grounds. Suddenly, the postilions exchange speech with</li>
<li class="L15092" rel="L15092">animated gesticulation, and the horses are pulled up, almost on their</li>
<li class="L15093" rel="L15093">haunches. We are pursued?</li>
<li class="L15094" rel="L15094"></li>
<li class="L15095" rel="L15095">“Ho! Within the carriage there. Speak then!”</li>
<li class="L15096" rel="L15096"></li>
<li class="L15097" rel="L15097">“What is it?” asks Mr. Lorry, looking out at window.</li>
<li class="L15098" rel="L15098"></li>
<li class="L15099" rel="L15099">“How many did they say?”</li>
<li class="L15100" rel="L15100"></li>
<li class="L15101" rel="L15101">“I do not understand you.”</li>
<li class="L15102" rel="L15102"></li>
<li class="L15103" rel="L15103">“--At the last post. How many to the Guillotine to-day?”</li>
<li class="L15104" rel="L15104"></li>
<li class="L15105" rel="L15105">“Fifty-two.”</li>
<li class="L15106" rel="L15106"></li>
<li class="L15107" rel="L15107">“I said so! A brave number! My fellow-citizen here would have it</li>
<li class="L15108" rel="L15108">forty-two; ten more heads are worth having. The Guillotine goes</li>
<li class="L15109" rel="L15109">handsomely. I love it. Hi forward. Whoop!”</li>

<li class="L15112" rel="L15112">to speak intelligibly; he thinks they are still together; he asks him,</li>
<li class="L15113" rel="L15113">by his name, what he has in his hand. O pity us, kind Heaven, and help</li>
<li class="L15114" rel="L15114">us! Look out, look out, and see if we are pursued.</li>
<li class="L15115" rel="L15115"></li>
<li class="L15116" rel="L15116">The wind is rushing after us, and the clouds are flying after us, and</li>
<li class="L15117" rel="L15117">the moon is plunging after us, and the whole wild night is in pursuit of</li>
<li class="L15118" rel="L15118">us; but, so far, we are pursued by nothing else.</li>

<li class="L15125" rel="L15125"></li>
<li class="L15126" rel="L15126">In that same juncture of time when the Fifty-Two awaited their fate</li>
<li class="L15127" rel="L15127">Madame Defarge held darkly ominous council with The Vengeance and</li>
<li class="L15128" rel="L15128">Jacques Three of the Revolutionary Jury. Not in the wine-shop did Madame</li>
<li class="L15129" rel="L15129">Defarge confer with these ministers, but in the shed of the wood-sawyer,</li>
<li class="L15130" rel="L15130">erst a mender of roads. The sawyer himself did not participate in the</li>
<li class="L15131" rel="L15131">conference, but abided at a little distance, like an outer satellite who</li>
<li class="L15132" rel="L15132">was not to speak until required, or to offer an opinion until invited.</li>
<li class="L15133" rel="L15133"></li>
<li class="L15134" rel="L15134">“But our Defarge,” said Jacques Three, “is undoubtedly a good</li>
<li class="L15135" rel="L15135">Republican? Eh?”</li>
<li class="L15136" rel="L15136"></li>
<li class="L15137" rel="L15137">“There is no better,” the voluble Vengeance protested in her shrill</li>
<li class="L15138" rel="L15138">notes, “in France.”</li>
<li class="L15139" rel="L15139"></li>
<li class="L15140" rel="L15140">“Peace, little Vengeance,” said Madame Defarge, laying her hand with</li>
<li class="L15141" rel="L15141">a slight frown on her lieutenant&#39;s lips, “hear me speak. My husband,</li>
<li class="L15142" rel="L15142">fellow-citizen, is a good Republican and a bold man; he has deserved</li>
<li class="L15143" rel="L15143">well of the Republic, and possesses its confidence. But my husband has</li>
<li class="L15144" rel="L15144">his weaknesses, and he is so weak as to relent towards this Doctor.”</li>
<li class="L15145" rel="L15145"></li>
<li class="L15146" rel="L15146">“It is a great pity,” croaked Jacques Three, dubiously shaking his head,</li>
<li class="L15147" rel="L15147">with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth; “it is not quite like a good</li>
<li class="L15148" rel="L15148">citizen; it is a thing to regret.”</li>
<li class="L15149" rel="L15149"></li>
<li class="L15150" rel="L15150">“See you,” said madame, “I care nothing for this Doctor, I. He may wear</li>
<li class="L15151" rel="L15151">his head or lose it, for any interest I have in him; it is all one to</li>
<li class="L15152" rel="L15152">me. But, the Evremonde people are to be exterminated, and the wife and</li>
<li class="L15153" rel="L15153">child must follow the husband and father.”</li>
<li class="L15154" rel="L15154"></li>
<li class="L15155" rel="L15155">“She has a fine head for it,” croaked Jacques Three. “I have seen blue</li>
<li class="L15156" rel="L15156">eyes and golden hair there, and they looked charming when Samson held</li>
<li class="L15157" rel="L15157">them up.” Ogre that he was, he spoke like an epicure.</li>
<li class="L15158" rel="L15158"></li>
<li class="L15159" rel="L15159">Madame Defarge cast down her eyes, and reflected a little.</li>
<li class="L15160" rel="L15160"></li>
<li class="L15161" rel="L15161">“The child also,” observed Jacques Three, with a meditative enjoyment</li>
<li class="L15162" rel="L15162">of his words, “has golden hair and blue eyes. And we seldom have a child</li>
<li class="L15163" rel="L15163">there. It is a pretty sight!”</li>
<li class="L15164" rel="L15164"></li>
<li class="L15165" rel="L15165">“In a word,” said Madame Defarge, coming out of her short abstraction,</li>
<li class="L15166" rel="L15166">“I cannot trust my husband in this matter. Not only do I feel, since</li>
<li class="L15167" rel="L15167">last night, that I dare not confide to him the details of my projects;</li>
<li class="L15168" rel="L15168">but also I feel that if I delay, there is danger of his giving warning,</li>
<li class="L15169" rel="L15169">and then they might escape.”</li>
<li class="L15170" rel="L15170"></li>
<li class="L15171" rel="L15171">“That must never be,” croaked Jacques Three; “no one must escape. We</li>
<li class="L15172" rel="L15172">have not half enough as it is. We ought to have six score a day.”</li>
<li class="L15173" rel="L15173"></li>
<li class="L15174" rel="L15174">“In a word,” Madame Defarge went on, “my husband has not my reason for</li>
<li class="L15175" rel="L15175">pursuing this family to annihilation, and I have not his reason for</li>
<li class="L15176" rel="L15176">regarding this Doctor with any sensibility. I must act for myself,</li>
<li class="L15177" rel="L15177">therefore. Come hither, little citizen.”</li>
<li class="L15178" rel="L15178"></li>
<li class="L15179" rel="L15179">The wood-sawyer, who held her in the respect, and himself in the</li>
<li class="L15180" rel="L15180">submission, of mortal fear, advanced with his hand to his red cap.</li>
<li class="L15181" rel="L15181"></li>
<li class="L15182" rel="L15182">“Touching those signals, little citizen,” said Madame Defarge, sternly,</li>
<li class="L15183" rel="L15183">“that she made to the prisoners; you are ready to bear witness to them</li>
<li class="L15184" rel="L15184">this very day?”</li>
<li class="L15185" rel="L15185"></li>
<li class="L15186" rel="L15186">“Ay, ay, why not!” cried the sawyer. “Every day, in all weathers, from</li>
<li class="L15187" rel="L15187">two to four, always signalling, sometimes with the little one, sometimes</li>
<li class="L15188" rel="L15188">without. I know what I know. I have seen with my eyes.”</li>
<li class="L15189" rel="L15189"></li>
<li class="L15190" rel="L15190">He made all manner of gestures while he spoke, as if in incidental</li>
<li class="L15191" rel="L15191">imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had</li>
<li class="L15192" rel="L15192">never seen.</li>
<li class="L15193" rel="L15193"></li>
<li class="L15194" rel="L15194">“Clearly plots,” said Jacques Three. “Transparently!”</li>
<li class="L15195" rel="L15195"></li>
<li class="L15196" rel="L15196">“There is no doubt of the Jury?” inquired Madame Defarge, letting her</li>
<li class="L15197" rel="L15197">eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile.</li>
<li class="L15198" rel="L15198"></li>
<li class="L15199" rel="L15199">“Rely upon the patriotic Jury, dear citizeness. I answer for my</li>
<li class="L15200" rel="L15200">fellow-Jurymen.”</li>
<li class="L15201" rel="L15201"></li>
<li class="L15202" rel="L15202">“Now, let me see,” said Madame Defarge, pondering again. “Yet once more!</li>
<li class="L15203" rel="L15203">Can I spare this Doctor to my husband? I have no feeling either way. Can</li>
<li class="L15204" rel="L15204">I spare him?”</li>
<li class="L15205" rel="L15205"></li>
<li class="L15206" rel="L15206">“He would count as one head,” observed Jacques Three, in a low voice.</li>
<li class="L15207" rel="L15207">“We really have not heads enough; it would be a pity, I think.”</li>
<li class="L15208" rel="L15208"></li>
<li class="L15209" rel="L15209">“He was signalling with her when I saw her,” argued Madame Defarge; “I</li>
<li class="L15210" rel="L15210">cannot speak of one without the other; and I must not be silent, and</li>
<li class="L15211" rel="L15211">trust the case wholly to him, this little citizen here. For, I am not a</li>
<li class="L15212" rel="L15212">bad witness.”</li>
<li class="L15213" rel="L15213"></li>
<li class="L15214" rel="L15214">The Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their fervent</li>
<li class="L15215" rel="L15215">protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of</li>
<li class="L15216" rel="L15216">witnesses. The little citizen, not to be outdone, declared her to be a</li>
<li class="L15217" rel="L15217">celestial witness.</li>
<li class="L15218" rel="L15218"></li>
<li class="L15219" rel="L15219">“He must take his chance,” said Madame Defarge. “No, I cannot spare</li>
<li class="L15220" rel="L15220">him! You are engaged at three o&#39;clock; you are going to see the batch of</li>
<li class="L15221" rel="L15221">to-day executed.--You?”</li>
<li class="L15222" rel="L15222"></li>
<li class="L15223" rel="L15223">The question was addressed to the wood-sawyer, who hurriedly replied in</li>
<li class="L15224" rel="L15224">the affirmative: seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent</li>
<li class="L15225" rel="L15225">of Republicans, and that he would be in effect the most desolate of</li>
<li class="L15226" rel="L15226">Republicans, if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of</li>
<li class="L15227" rel="L15227">smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national</li>
<li class="L15228" rel="L15228">barber. He was so very demonstrative herein, that he might have been</li>
<li class="L15229" rel="L15229">suspected (perhaps was, by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at</li>
<li class="L15230" rel="L15230">him out of Madame Defarge&#39;s head) of having his small individual fears</li>
<li class="L15231" rel="L15231">for his own personal safety, every hour in the day.</li>
<li class="L15232" rel="L15232"></li>
<li class="L15233" rel="L15233">“I,” said madame, “am equally engaged at the same place. After it is</li>
<li class="L15234" rel="L15234">over--say at eight to-night--come you to me, in Saint Antoine, and we</li>
<li class="L15235" rel="L15235">will give information against these people at my Section.”</li>
<li class="L15236" rel="L15236"></li>
<li class="L15237" rel="L15237">The wood-sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the</li>
<li class="L15238" rel="L15238">citizeness. The citizeness looking at him, he became embarrassed, evaded</li>
<li class="L15239" rel="L15239">her glance as a small dog would have done, retreated among his wood, and</li>
<li class="L15240" rel="L15240">hid his confusion over the handle of his saw.</li>
<li class="L15241" rel="L15241"></li>
<li class="L15242" rel="L15242">Madame Defarge beckoned the Juryman and The Vengeance a little nearer to</li>
<li class="L15243" rel="L15243">the door, and there expounded her further views to them thus:</li>
<li class="L15244" rel="L15244"></li>
<li class="L15245" rel="L15245">“She will now be at home, awaiting the moment of his death. She will</li>
<li class="L15246" rel="L15246">be mourning and grieving. She will be in a state of mind to impeach the</li>
<li class="L15247" rel="L15247">justice of the Republic. She will be full of sympathy with its enemies.</li>
<li class="L15248" rel="L15248">I will go to her.”</li>
<li class="L15249" rel="L15249"></li>
<li class="L15250" rel="L15250">“What an admirable woman; what an adorable woman!” exclaimed Jacques</li>
<li class="L15251" rel="L15251">Three, rapturously. “Ah, my cherished!” cried The Vengeance; and</li>
<li class="L15252" rel="L15252">embraced her.</li>
<li class="L15253" rel="L15253"></li>
<li class="L15254" rel="L15254">“Take you my knitting,” said Madame Defarge, placing it in her</li>
<li class="L15255" rel="L15255">lieutenant&#39;s hands, “and have it ready for me in my usual seat. Keep</li>
<li class="L15256" rel="L15256">me my usual chair. Go you there, straight, for there will probably be a</li>
<li class="L15257" rel="L15257">greater concourse than usual, to-day.”</li>
<li class="L15258" rel="L15258"></li>
<li class="L15259" rel="L15259">“I willingly obey the orders of my Chief,” said The Vengeance with</li>
<li class="L15260" rel="L15260">alacrity, and kissing her cheek. “You will not be late?”</li>
<li class="L15261" rel="L15261"></li>
<li class="L15262" rel="L15262">“I shall be there before the commencement.”</li>
<li class="L15263" rel="L15263"></li>
<li class="L15264" rel="L15264">“And before the tumbrils arrive. Be sure you are there, my soul,” said</li>
<li class="L15265" rel="L15265">The Vengeance, calling after her, for she had already turned into the</li>
<li class="L15266" rel="L15266">street, “before the tumbrils arrive!”</li>
<li class="L15267" rel="L15267"></li>
<li class="L15268" rel="L15268">Madame Defarge slightly waved her hand, to imply that she heard, and</li>
<li class="L15269" rel="L15269">might be relied upon to arrive in good time, and so went through the</li>
<li class="L15270" rel="L15270">mud, and round the corner of the prison wall. The Vengeance and the</li>
<li class="L15271" rel="L15271">Juryman, looking after her as she walked away, were highly appreciative</li>
<li class="L15272" rel="L15272">of her fine figure, and her superb moral endowments.</li>
<li class="L15273" rel="L15273"></li>
<li class="L15274" rel="L15274">There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a dreadfully</li>
<li class="L15275" rel="L15275">disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to be dreaded</li>
<li class="L15276" rel="L15276">than this ruthless woman, now taking her way along the streets. Of a</li>
<li class="L15277" rel="L15277">strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness, of great</li>
<li class="L15278" rel="L15278">determination, of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart</li>
<li class="L15279" rel="L15279">to its possessor firmness and animosity, but to strike into others an</li>
<li class="L15280" rel="L15280">instinctive recognition of those qualities; the troubled time would have</li>
<li class="L15281" rel="L15281">heaved her up, under any circumstances. But, imbued from her childhood</li>
<li class="L15282" rel="L15282">with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of a class,</li>
<li class="L15283" rel="L15283">opportunity had developed her into a tigress. She was absolutely without</li>
<li class="L15284" rel="L15284">pity. If she had ever had the virtue in her, it had quite gone out of</li>
<li class="L15285" rel="L15285">her.</li>
<li class="L15286" rel="L15286"></li>
<li class="L15287" rel="L15287">It was nothing to her, that an innocent man was to die for the sins of</li>
<li class="L15288" rel="L15288">his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them. It was nothing to her, that</li>
<li class="L15289" rel="L15289">his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was</li>
<li class="L15290" rel="L15290">insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and</li>
<li class="L15291" rel="L15291">her prey, and as such had no right to live. To appeal to her, was made</li>
<li class="L15292" rel="L15292">hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself. If she had</li>
<li class="L15293" rel="L15293">been laid low in the streets, in any of the many encounters in which</li>
<li class="L15294" rel="L15294">she had been engaged, she would not have pitied herself; nor, if she had</li>
<li class="L15295" rel="L15295">been ordered to the axe to-morrow, would she have gone to it with any</li>
<li class="L15296" rel="L15296">softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who</li>
<li class="L15297" rel="L15297">sent her there.</li>
<li class="L15298" rel="L15298"></li>
<li class="L15299" rel="L15299">Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe. Carelessly</li>
<li class="L15300" rel="L15300">worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her</li>
<li class="L15301" rel="L15301">dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap. Lying hidden in her</li>
<li class="L15302" rel="L15302">bosom, was a loaded pistol. Lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened</li>
<li class="L15303" rel="L15303">dagger. Thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of such</li>
<li class="L15304" rel="L15304">a character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually</li>
<li class="L15305" rel="L15305">walked in her girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, on the brown</li>
<li class="L15306" rel="L15306">sea-sand, Madame Defarge took her way along the streets.</li>
<li class="L15307" rel="L15307"></li>
<li class="L15308" rel="L15308">Now, when the journey of the travelling coach, at that very moment</li>
<li class="L15309" rel="L15309">waiting for the completion of its load, had been planned out last night,</li>
<li class="L15310" rel="L15310">the difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr. Lorry&#39;s</li>
<li class="L15311" rel="L15311">attention. It was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach,</li>
<li class="L15312" rel="L15312">but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining</li>
<li class="L15313" rel="L15313">it and its passengers, should be reduced to the utmost; since their</li>
<li class="L15314" rel="L15314">escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there.</li>
<li class="L15315" rel="L15315">Finally, he had proposed, after anxious consideration, that Miss Pross</li>
<li class="L15316" rel="L15316">and Jerry, who were at liberty to leave the city, should leave it at</li>
<li class="L15317" rel="L15317">three o&#39;clock in the lightest-wheeled conveyance known to that period.</li>
<li class="L15318" rel="L15318">Unencumbered with luggage, they would soon overtake the coach, and,</li>
<li class="L15319" rel="L15319">passing it and preceding it on the road, would order its horses in</li>
<li class="L15320" rel="L15320">advance, and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours</li>
<li class="L15321" rel="L15321">of the night, when delay was the most to be dreaded.</li>
<li class="L15322" rel="L15322"></li>
<li class="L15323" rel="L15323">Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that</li>
<li class="L15324" rel="L15324">pressing emergency, Miss Pross hailed it with joy. She and Jerry had</li>
<li class="L15325" rel="L15325">beheld the coach start, had known who it was that Solomon brought, had</li>
<li class="L15326" rel="L15326">passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding</li>
<li class="L15327" rel="L15327">their arrangements to follow the coach, even as Madame Defarge,</li>
<li class="L15328" rel="L15328">taking her way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the</li>
<li class="L15329" rel="L15329">else-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation.</li>
<li class="L15330" rel="L15330"></li>
<li class="L15331" rel="L15331">“Now what do you think, Mr. Cruncher,” said Miss Pross, whose agitation</li>
<li class="L15332" rel="L15332">was so great that she could hardly speak, or stand, or move, or live:</li>
<li class="L15333" rel="L15333">“what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard? Another</li>
<li class="L15334" rel="L15334">carriage having already gone from here to-day, it might awaken</li>
<li class="L15335" rel="L15335">suspicion.”</li>
<li class="L15336" rel="L15336"></li>
<li class="L15337" rel="L15337">“My opinion, miss,” returned Mr. Cruncher, “is as you&#39;re right. Likewise</li>
<li class="L15338" rel="L15338">wot I&#39;ll stand by you, right or wrong.”</li>
<li class="L15339" rel="L15339"></li>
<li class="L15340" rel="L15340">“I am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures,” said</li>
<li class="L15341" rel="L15341">Miss Pross, wildly crying, “that I am incapable of forming any plan. Are</li>
<li class="L15342" rel="L15342">_you_ capable of forming any plan, my dear good Mr. Cruncher?”</li>
<li class="L15343" rel="L15343"></li>
<li class="L15344" rel="L15344">“Respectin&#39; a future spear o&#39; life, miss,” returned Mr. Cruncher, “I</li>
<li class="L15345" rel="L15345">hope so. Respectin&#39; any present use o&#39; this here blessed old head o&#39;</li>
<li class="L15346" rel="L15346">mine, I think not. Would you do me the favour, miss, to take notice o&#39;</li>
<li class="L15347" rel="L15347">two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here</li>
<li class="L15348" rel="L15348">crisis?”</li>
<li class="L15349" rel="L15349"></li>
<li class="L15350" rel="L15350">“Oh, for gracious sake!” cried Miss Pross, still wildly crying, “record</li>
<li class="L15351" rel="L15351">them at once, and get them out of the way, like an excellent man.”</li>
<li class="L15352" rel="L15352"></li>
<li class="L15353" rel="L15353">“First,” said Mr. Cruncher, who was all in a tremble, and who spoke with</li>
<li class="L15354" rel="L15354">an ashy and solemn visage, “them poor things well out o&#39; this, never no</li>
<li class="L15355" rel="L15355">more will I do it, never no more!”</li>
<li class="L15356" rel="L15356"></li>
<li class="L15357" rel="L15357">“I am quite sure, Mr. Cruncher,” returned Miss Pross, “that you</li>
<li class="L15358" rel="L15358">never will do it again, whatever it is, and I beg you not to think it</li>
<li class="L15359" rel="L15359">necessary to mention more particularly what it is.”</li>
<li class="L15360" rel="L15360"></li>
<li class="L15361" rel="L15361">“No, miss,” returned Jerry, “it shall not be named to you. Second: them</li>
<li class="L15362" rel="L15362">poor things well out o&#39; this, and never no more will I interfere with</li>
<li class="L15363" rel="L15363">Mrs. Cruncher&#39;s flopping, never no more!”</li>
<li class="L15364" rel="L15364"></li>
<li class="L15365" rel="L15365">“Whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be,” said Miss Pross,</li>
<li class="L15366" rel="L15366">striving to dry her eyes and compose herself, “I have no doubt it</li>
<li class="L15367" rel="L15367">is best that Mrs. Cruncher should have it entirely under her own</li>
<li class="L15368" rel="L15368">superintendence.--O my poor darlings!”</li>
<li class="L15369" rel="L15369"></li>
<li class="L15370" rel="L15370">“I go so far as to say, miss, moreover,” proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with a</li>
<li class="L15371" rel="L15371">most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit--“and let my words</li>
<li class="L15372" rel="L15372">be took down and took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourself--that wot my</li>
<li class="L15373" rel="L15373">opinions respectin&#39; flopping has undergone a change, and that wot I only</li>
<li class="L15374" rel="L15374">hope with all my heart as Mrs. Cruncher may be a flopping at the present</li>
<li class="L15375" rel="L15375">time.”</li>
<li class="L15376" rel="L15376"></li>
<li class="L15377" rel="L15377">“There, there, there! I hope she is, my dear man,” cried the distracted</li>
<li class="L15378" rel="L15378">Miss Pross, “and I hope she finds it answering her expectations.”</li>
<li class="L15379" rel="L15379"></li>
<li class="L15380" rel="L15380">“Forbid it,” proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with additional solemnity,</li>
<li class="L15381" rel="L15381">additional slowness, and additional tendency to hold forth and hold</li>
<li class="L15382" rel="L15382">out, “as anything wot I have ever said or done should be wisited on my</li>
<li class="L15383" rel="L15383">earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now! Forbid it as we shouldn&#39;t all</li>
<li class="L15384" rel="L15384">flop (if it was anyways conwenient) to get &#39;em out o&#39; this here dismal</li>
<li class="L15385" rel="L15385">risk! Forbid it, miss! Wot I say, for-_bid_ it!” This was Mr. Cruncher&#39;s</li>
<li class="L15386" rel="L15386">conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one.</li>
<li class="L15387" rel="L15387"></li>
<li class="L15388" rel="L15388">And still Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came</li>
<li class="L15389" rel="L15389">nearer and nearer.</li>
<li class="L15390" rel="L15390"></li>
<li class="L15391" rel="L15391">“If we ever get back to our native land,” said Miss Pross, “you may rely</li>
<li class="L15392" rel="L15392">upon my telling Mrs. Cruncher as much as I may be able to remember and</li>
<li class="L15393" rel="L15393">understand of what you have so impressively said; and at all events</li>
<li class="L15394" rel="L15394">you may be sure that I shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in</li>
<li class="L15395" rel="L15395">earnest at this dreadful time. Now, pray let us think! My esteemed Mr.</li>
<li class="L15396" rel="L15396">Cruncher, let us think!”</li>
<li class="L15397" rel="L15397"></li>
<li class="L15398" rel="L15398">Still, Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer</li>
<li class="L15399" rel="L15399">and nearer.</li>
<li class="L15400" rel="L15400"></li>
<li class="L15401" rel="L15401">“If you were to go before,” said Miss Pross, “and stop the vehicle and</li>
<li class="L15402" rel="L15402">horses from coming here, and were to wait somewhere for me; wouldn&#39;t</li>
<li class="L15403" rel="L15403">that be best?”</li>
<li class="L15404" rel="L15404"></li>
<li class="L15405" rel="L15405">Mr. Cruncher thought it might be best.</li>
<li class="L15406" rel="L15406"></li>
<li class="L15407" rel="L15407">“Where could you wait for me?” asked Miss Pross.</li>
<li class="L15408" rel="L15408"></li>
<li class="L15409" rel="L15409">Mr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but</li>
<li class="L15410" rel="L15410">Temple Bar. Alas! Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and Madame</li>
<li class="L15411" rel="L15411">Defarge was drawing very near indeed.</li>
<li class="L15412" rel="L15412"></li>
<li class="L15413" rel="L15413">“By the cathedral door,” said Miss Pross. “Would it be much out of</li>
<li class="L15414" rel="L15414">the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two</li>
<li class="L15415" rel="L15415">towers?”</li>
<li class="L15416" rel="L15416"></li>
<li class="L15417" rel="L15417">“No, miss,” answered Mr. Cruncher.</li>
<li class="L15418" rel="L15418"></li>
<li class="L15419" rel="L15419">“Then, like the best of men,” said Miss Pross, “go to the posting-house</li>
<li class="L15420" rel="L15420">straight, and make that change.”</li>
<li class="L15421" rel="L15421"></li>
<li class="L15422" rel="L15422">“I am doubtful,” said Mr. Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his head,</li>
<li class="L15423" rel="L15423">“about leaving of you, you see. We don&#39;t know what may happen.”</li>
<li class="L15424" rel="L15424"></li>
<li class="L15425" rel="L15425">“Heaven knows we don&#39;t,” returned Miss Pross, “but have no fear for me.</li>
<li class="L15426" rel="L15426">Take me in at the cathedral, at Three o&#39;Clock, or as near it as you can,</li>
<li class="L15427" rel="L15427">and I am sure it will be better than our going from here. I feel certain</li>
<li class="L15428" rel="L15428">of it. There! Bless you, Mr. Cruncher! Think-not of me, but of the lives</li>
<li class="L15429" rel="L15429">that may depend on both of us!”</li>
<li class="L15430" rel="L15430"></li>
<li class="L15431" rel="L15431">This exordium, and Miss Pross&#39;s two hands in quite agonised entreaty</li>
<li class="L15432" rel="L15432">clasping his, decided Mr. Cruncher. With an encouraging nod or two, he</li>
<li class="L15433" rel="L15433">immediately went out to alter the arrangements, and left her by herself</li>
<li class="L15434" rel="L15434">to follow as she had proposed.</li>
<li class="L15435" rel="L15435"></li>
<li class="L15436" rel="L15436">The having originated a precaution which was already in course of</li>
<li class="L15437" rel="L15437">execution, was a great relief to Miss Pross. The necessity of composing</li>
<li class="L15438" rel="L15438">her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the</li>
<li class="L15439" rel="L15439">streets, was another relief. She looked at her watch, and it was twenty</li>
<li class="L15440" rel="L15440">minutes past two. She had no time to lose, but must get ready at once.</li>
<li class="L15441" rel="L15441"></li>
<li class="L15442" rel="L15442">Afraid, in her extreme perturbation, of the loneliness of the deserted</li>
<li class="L15443" rel="L15443">rooms, and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door</li>
<li class="L15444" rel="L15444">in them, Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes,</li>
<li class="L15445" rel="L15445">which were swollen and red. Haunted by her feverish apprehensions, she</li>
<li class="L15446" rel="L15446">could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the</li>
<li class="L15447" rel="L15447">dripping water, but constantly paused and looked round to see that there</li>
<li class="L15448" rel="L15448">was no one watching her. In one of those pauses she recoiled and cried</li>
<li class="L15449" rel="L15449">out, for she saw a figure standing in the room.</li>
<li class="L15450" rel="L15450"></li>
<li class="L15451" rel="L15451">The basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet of</li>
<li class="L15452" rel="L15452">Madame Defarge. By strange stern ways, and through much staining blood,</li>
<li class="L15453" rel="L15453">those feet had come to meet that water.</li>
<li class="L15454" rel="L15454"></li>
<li class="L15455" rel="L15455">Madame Defarge looked coldly at her, and said, “The wife of Evremonde;</li>
<li class="L15456" rel="L15456">where is she?”</li>
<li class="L15457" rel="L15457"></li>
<li class="L15458" rel="L15458">It flashed upon Miss Pross&#39;s mind that the doors were all standing open,</li>
<li class="L15459" rel="L15459">and would suggest the flight. Her first act was to shut them. There were</li>
<li class="L15460" rel="L15460">four in the room, and she shut them all. She then placed herself before</li>
<li class="L15461" rel="L15461">the door of the chamber which Lucie had occupied.</li>
<li class="L15462" rel="L15462"></li>
<li class="L15463" rel="L15463">Madame Defarge&#39;s dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement,</li>
<li class="L15464" rel="L15464">and rested on her when it was finished. Miss Pross had nothing beautiful</li>
<li class="L15465" rel="L15465">about her; years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the grimness,</li>
<li class="L15466" rel="L15466">of her appearance; but, she too was a determined woman in her different</li>
<li class="L15467" rel="L15467">way, and she measured Madame Defarge with her eyes, every inch.</li>
<li class="L15468" rel="L15468"></li>
<li class="L15469" rel="L15469">“You might, from your appearance, be the wife of Lucifer,” said Miss</li>
<li class="L15470" rel="L15470">Pross, in her breathing. “Nevertheless, you shall not get the better of</li>
<li class="L15471" rel="L15471">me. I am an Englishwoman.”</li>
<li class="L15472" rel="L15472"></li>
<li class="L15473" rel="L15473">Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something of</li>
<li class="L15474" rel="L15474">Miss Pross&#39;s own perception that they two were at bay. She saw a tight,</li>
<li class="L15475" rel="L15475">hard, wiry woman before her, as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same figure a</li>
<li class="L15476" rel="L15476">woman with a strong hand, in the years gone by. She knew full well that</li>
<li class="L15477" rel="L15477">Miss Pross was the family&#39;s devoted friend; Miss Pross knew full well</li>
<li class="L15478" rel="L15478">that Madame Defarge was the family&#39;s malevolent enemy.</li>
<li class="L15479" rel="L15479"></li>
<li class="L15480" rel="L15480">“On my way yonder,” said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of</li>
<li class="L15481" rel="L15481">her hand towards the fatal spot, “where they reserve my chair and my</li>
<li class="L15482" rel="L15482">knitting for me, I am come to make my compliments to her in passing. I</li>
<li class="L15483" rel="L15483">wish to see her.”</li>
<li class="L15484" rel="L15484"></li>
<li class="L15485" rel="L15485">“I know that your intentions are evil,” said Miss Pross, “and you may</li>
<li class="L15486" rel="L15486">depend upon it, I&#39;ll hold my own against them.”</li>
<li class="L15487" rel="L15487"></li>
<li class="L15488" rel="L15488">Each spoke in her own language; neither understood the other&#39;s words;</li>
<li class="L15489" rel="L15489">both were very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and manner, what</li>
<li class="L15490" rel="L15490">the unintelligible words meant.</li>
<li class="L15491" rel="L15491"></li>
<li class="L15492" rel="L15492">“It will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this</li>
<li class="L15493" rel="L15493">moment,” said Madame Defarge. “Good patriots will know what that means.</li>
<li class="L15494" rel="L15494">Let me see her. Go tell her that I wish to see her. Do you hear?”</li>
<li class="L15495" rel="L15495"></li>
<li class="L15496" rel="L15496">“If those eyes of yours were bed-winches,” returned Miss Pross, “and I</li>
<li class="L15497" rel="L15497">was an English four-poster, they shouldn&#39;t loose a splinter of me. No,</li>
<li class="L15498" rel="L15498">you wicked foreign woman; I am your match.”</li>
<li class="L15499" rel="L15499"></li>
<li class="L15500" rel="L15500">Madame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in</li>
<li class="L15501" rel="L15501">detail; but, she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set</li>
<li class="L15502" rel="L15502">at naught.</li>
<li class="L15503" rel="L15503"></li>
<li class="L15504" rel="L15504">“Woman imbecile and pig-like!” said Madame Defarge, frowning. “I take no</li>
<li class="L15505" rel="L15505">answer from you. I demand to see her. Either tell her that I demand</li>
<li class="L15506" rel="L15506">to see her, or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her!”</li>
<li class="L15507" rel="L15507"> This, with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm.</li>
<li class="L15508" rel="L15508"></li>
<li class="L15509" rel="L15509">“I little thought,” said Miss Pross, “that I should ever want to</li>
<li class="L15510" rel="L15510">understand your nonsensical language; but I would give all I have,</li>
<li class="L15511" rel="L15511">except the clothes I wear, to know whether you suspect the truth, or any</li>
<li class="L15512" rel="L15512">part of it.”</li>
<li class="L15513" rel="L15513"></li>
<li class="L15514" rel="L15514">Neither of them for a single moment released the other&#39;s eyes. Madame</li>
<li class="L15515" rel="L15515">Defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when Miss Pross</li>
<li class="L15516" rel="L15516">first became aware of her; but, she now advanced one step.</li>
<li class="L15517" rel="L15517"></li>
<li class="L15518" rel="L15518">“I am a Briton,” said Miss Pross, “I am desperate. I don&#39;t care an</li>
<li class="L15519" rel="L15519">English Twopence for myself. I know that the longer I keep you here, the</li>
<li class="L15520" rel="L15520">greater hope there is for my Ladybird. I&#39;ll not leave a handful of that</li>
<li class="L15521" rel="L15521">dark hair upon your head, if you lay a finger on me!”</li>
<li class="L15522" rel="L15522"></li>
<li class="L15523" rel="L15523">Thus Miss Pross, with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes</li>
<li class="L15524" rel="L15524">between every rapid sentence, and every rapid sentence a whole breath.</li>
<li class="L15525" rel="L15525">Thus Miss Pross, who had never struck a blow in her life.</li>
<li class="L15526" rel="L15526"></li>
<li class="L15527" rel="L15527">But, her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the</li>
<li class="L15528" rel="L15528">irrepressible tears into her eyes. This was a courage that Madame</li>
<li class="L15529" rel="L15529">Defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness. “Ha, ha!” she</li>
<li class="L15530" rel="L15530">laughed, “you poor wretch! What are you worth! I address myself to that</li>
<li class="L15531" rel="L15531">Doctor.” Then she raised her voice and called out, “Citizen Doctor! Wife</li>
<li class="L15532" rel="L15532">of Evremonde! Child of Evremonde! Any person but this miserable fool,</li>
<li class="L15533" rel="L15533">answer the Citizeness Defarge!”</li>
<li class="L15534" rel="L15534"></li>
<li class="L15535" rel="L15535">Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the</li>
<li class="L15536" rel="L15536">expression of Miss Pross&#39;s face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from</li>
<li class="L15537" rel="L15537">either suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone.</li>
<li class="L15538" rel="L15538">Three of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in.</li>
<li class="L15539" rel="L15539"></li>
<li class="L15540" rel="L15540">“Those rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there</li>
<li class="L15541" rel="L15541">are odds and ends upon the ground. There is no one in that room behind</li>
<li class="L15542" rel="L15542">you! Let me look.”</li>
<li class="L15543" rel="L15543"></li>
<li class="L15544" rel="L15544">“Never!” said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly as</li>
<li class="L15545" rel="L15545">Madame Defarge understood the answer.</li>
<li class="L15546" rel="L15546"></li>
<li class="L15547" rel="L15547">“If they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and</li>
<li class="L15548" rel="L15548">brought back,” said Madame Defarge to herself.</li>
<li class="L15549" rel="L15549"></li>
<li class="L15550" rel="L15550">“As long as you don&#39;t know whether they are in that room or not, you are</li>
<li class="L15551" rel="L15551">uncertain what to do,” said Miss Pross to herself; “and you shall not</li>
<li class="L15552" rel="L15552">know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know</li>
<li class="L15553" rel="L15553">that, you shall not leave here while I can hold you.”</li>
<li class="L15554" rel="L15554"></li>
<li class="L15555" rel="L15555">“I have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me,</li>
<li class="L15556" rel="L15556">I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door,” said</li>
<li class="L15557" rel="L15557">Madame Defarge.</li>
<li class="L15558" rel="L15558"></li>
<li class="L15559" rel="L15559">“We are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard, we are</li>
<li class="L15560" rel="L15560">not likely to be heard, and I pray for bodily strength to keep you here,</li>
<li class="L15561" rel="L15561">while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to</li>
<li class="L15562" rel="L15562">my darling,” said Miss Pross.</li>
<li class="L15563" rel="L15563"></li>
<li class="L15564" rel="L15564">Madame Defarge made at the door. Miss Pross, on the instinct of the</li>
<li class="L15565" rel="L15565">moment, seized her round the waist in both her arms, and held her tight.</li>
<li class="L15566" rel="L15566">It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike; Miss Pross,</li>
<li class="L15567" rel="L15567">with the vigorous tenacity of love, always so much stronger than hate,</li>
<li class="L15568" rel="L15568">clasped her tight, and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle</li>
<li class="L15569" rel="L15569">that they had. The two hands of Madame Defarge buffeted and tore her</li>
<li class="L15570" rel="L15570">face; but, Miss Pross, with her head down, held her round the waist, and</li>
<li class="L15571" rel="L15571">clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman.</li>
<li class="L15572" rel="L15572"></li>
<li class="L15573" rel="L15573">Soon, Madame Defarge&#39;s hands ceased to strike, and felt at her encircled</li>
<li class="L15574" rel="L15574">waist. “It is under my arm,” said Miss Pross, in smothered tones, “you</li>
<li class="L15575" rel="L15575">shall not draw it. I am stronger than you, I bless Heaven for it. I hold</li>
<li class="L15576" rel="L15576">you till one or other of us faints or dies!”</li>
<li class="L15577" rel="L15577"></li>
<li class="L15578" rel="L15578">Madame Defarge&#39;s hands were at her bosom. Miss Pross looked up, saw</li>
<li class="L15579" rel="L15579">what it was, struck at it, struck out a flash and a crash, and stood</li>
<li class="L15580" rel="L15580">alone--blinded with smoke.</li>
<li class="L15581" rel="L15581"></li>
<li class="L15582" rel="L15582">All this was in a second. As the smoke cleared, leaving an awful</li>
<li class="L15583" rel="L15583">stillness, it passed out on the air, like the soul of the furious woman</li>
<li class="L15584" rel="L15584">whose body lay lifeless on the ground.</li>
<li class="L15585" rel="L15585"></li>
<li class="L15586" rel="L15586">In the first fright and horror of her situation, Miss Pross passed the</li>
<li class="L15587" rel="L15587">body as far from it as she could, and ran down the stairs to call for</li>
<li class="L15588" rel="L15588">fruitless help. Happily, she bethought herself of the consequences of</li>
<li class="L15589" rel="L15589">what she did, in time to check herself and go back. It was dreadful to</li>
<li class="L15590" rel="L15590">go in at the door again; but, she did go in, and even went near it, to</li>
<li class="L15591" rel="L15591">get the bonnet and other things that she must wear. These she put on,</li>
<li class="L15592" rel="L15592">out on the staircase, first shutting and locking the door and taking</li>
<li class="L15593" rel="L15593">away the key. She then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe</li>
<li class="L15594" rel="L15594">and to cry, and then got up and hurried away.</li>
<li class="L15595" rel="L15595"></li>
<li class="L15596" rel="L15596">By good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet, or she could hardly have</li>
<li class="L15597" rel="L15597">gone along the streets without being stopped. By good fortune, too, she</li>
<li class="L15598" rel="L15598">was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement</li>
<li class="L15599" rel="L15599">like any other woman. She needed both advantages, for the marks of</li>
<li class="L15600" rel="L15600">gripping fingers were deep in her face, and her hair was torn, and her</li>
<li class="L15601" rel="L15601">dress (hastily composed with unsteady hands) was clutched and dragged a</li>
<li class="L15602" rel="L15602">hundred ways.</li>
<li class="L15603" rel="L15603"></li>
<li class="L15604" rel="L15604">In crossing the bridge, she dropped the door key in the river. Arriving</li>
<li class="L15605" rel="L15605">at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort, and waiting there,</li>
<li class="L15606" rel="L15606">she thought, what if the key were already taken in a net, what if</li>
<li class="L15607" rel="L15607">it were identified, what if the door were opened and the remains</li>
<li class="L15608" rel="L15608">discovered, what if she were stopped at the gate, sent to prison, and</li>
<li class="L15609" rel="L15609">charged with murder! In the midst of these fluttering thoughts, the</li>
<li class="L15610" rel="L15610">escort appeared, took her in, and took her away.</li>
<li class="L15611" rel="L15611"></li>
<li class="L15612" rel="L15612">“Is there any noise in the streets?” she asked him.</li>
<li class="L15613" rel="L15613"></li>
<li class="L15614" rel="L15614">“The usual noises,” Mr. Cruncher replied; and looked surprised by the</li>
<li class="L15615" rel="L15615">question and by her aspect.</li>
<li class="L15616" rel="L15616"></li>
<li class="L15617" rel="L15617">“I don&#39;t hear you,” said Miss Pross. “What do you say?”</li>
<li class="L15618" rel="L15618"></li>
<li class="L15619" rel="L15619">It was in vain for Mr. Cruncher to repeat what he said; Miss Pross could</li>
<li class="L15620" rel="L15620">not hear him. “So I&#39;ll nod my head,” thought Mr. Cruncher, amazed, “at</li>
<li class="L15621" rel="L15621">all events she&#39;ll see that.” And she did.</li>
<li class="L15622" rel="L15622"></li>
<li class="L15623" rel="L15623">“Is there any noise in the streets now?” asked Miss Pross again,</li>
<li class="L15624" rel="L15624">presently.</li>
<li class="L15625" rel="L15625"></li>
<li class="L15626" rel="L15626">Again Mr. Cruncher nodded his head.</li>
<li class="L15627" rel="L15627"></li>
<li class="L15628" rel="L15628">“I don&#39;t hear it.”</li>
<li class="L15629" rel="L15629"></li>
<li class="L15630" rel="L15630">“Gone deaf in an hour?” said Mr. Cruncher, ruminating, with his mind</li>
<li class="L15631" rel="L15631">much disturbed; “wot&#39;s come to her?”</li>
<li class="L15632" rel="L15632"></li>
<li class="L15633" rel="L15633">“I feel,” said Miss Pross, “as if there had been a flash and a crash,</li>
<li class="L15634" rel="L15634">and that crash was the last thing I should ever hear in this life.”</li>
<li class="L15635" rel="L15635"></li>
<li class="L15636" rel="L15636">“Blest if she ain&#39;t in a queer condition!” said Mr. Cruncher, more and</li>
<li class="L15637" rel="L15637">more disturbed. “Wot can she have been a takin&#39;, to keep her courage up?</li>
<li class="L15638" rel="L15638">Hark! There&#39;s the roll of them dreadful carts! You can hear that, miss?”</li>
<li class="L15639" rel="L15639"></li>
<li class="L15640" rel="L15640">“I can hear,” said Miss Pross, seeing that he spoke to her, “nothing. O,</li>
<li class="L15641" rel="L15641">my good man, there was first a great crash, and then a great stillness,</li>
<li class="L15642" rel="L15642">and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable, never to be</li>
<li class="L15643" rel="L15643">broken any more as long as my life lasts.”</li>
<li class="L15644" rel="L15644"></li>
<li class="L15645" rel="L15645">“If she don&#39;t hear the roll of those dreadful carts, now very nigh their</li>
<li class="L15646" rel="L15646">journey&#39;s end,” said Mr. Cruncher, glancing over his shoulder, “it&#39;s my</li>
<li class="L15647" rel="L15647">opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world.”</li>
<li class="L15648" rel="L15648"></li>
<li class="L15649" rel="L15649">And indeed she never did.</li>
<li class="L15650" rel="L15650"></li>
<li class="L15651" rel="L15651"></li>
<li class="L15652" rel="L15652"></li>
<li class="L15653" rel="L15653"></li>
<li class="L15654" rel="L15654">XV. The Footsteps Die Out For Ever</li>
<li class="L15655" rel="L15655"></li>
<li class="L15656" rel="L15656"></li>
<li class="L15657" rel="L15657">Along the Paris streets, the death-carts rumble, hollow and harsh. Six</li>
<li class="L15658" rel="L15658">tumbrils carry the day&#39;s wine to La Guillotine. All the devouring and</li>
<li class="L15659" rel="L15659">insatiate Monsters imagined since imagination could record itself,</li>
<li class="L15660" rel="L15660">are fused in the one realisation, Guillotine. And yet there is not in</li>
<li class="L15661" rel="L15661">France, with its rich variety of soil and climate, a blade, a leaf,</li>
<li class="L15662" rel="L15662">a root, a sprig, a peppercorn, which will grow to maturity under</li>
<li class="L15663" rel="L15663">conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror. Crush</li>
<li class="L15664" rel="L15664">humanity out of shape once more, under similar hammers, and it will</li>
<li class="L15665" rel="L15665">twist itself into the same tortured forms. Sow the same seed of</li>
<li class="L15666" rel="L15666">rapacious license and oppression over again, and it will surely yield</li>
<li class="L15667" rel="L15667">the same fruit according to its kind.</li>
<li class="L15668" rel="L15668"></li>
<li class="L15669" rel="L15669">Six tumbrils roll along the streets. Change these back again to what</li>
<li class="L15670" rel="L15670">they were, thou powerful enchanter, Time, and they shall be seen to be</li>
<li class="L15671" rel="L15671">the carriages of absolute monarchs, the equipages of feudal nobles, the</li>
<li class="L15672" rel="L15672">toilettes of flaring Jezebels, the churches that are not my father&#39;s</li>
<li class="L15673" rel="L15673">house but dens of thieves, the huts of millions of starving peasants!</li>
<li class="L15674" rel="L15674">No; the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order</li>
<li class="L15675" rel="L15675">of the Creator, never reverses his transformations. “If thou be changed</li>
<li class="L15676" rel="L15676">into this shape by the will of God,” say the seers to the enchanted, in</li>
<li class="L15677" rel="L15677">the wise Arabian stories, “then remain so! But, if thou wear this</li>
<li class="L15678" rel="L15678">form through mere passing conjuration, then resume thy former aspect!”</li>
<li class="L15679" rel="L15679"> Changeless and hopeless, the tumbrils roll along.</li>
<li class="L15680" rel="L15680"></li>
<li class="L15681" rel="L15681">As the sombre wheels of the six carts go round, they seem to plough up</li>
<li class="L15682" rel="L15682">a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets. Ridges of faces</li>
<li class="L15683" rel="L15683">are thrown to this side and to that, and the ploughs go steadily onward.</li>
<li class="L15684" rel="L15684">So used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle, that</li>
<li class="L15685" rel="L15685">in many windows there are no people, and in some the occupation of the</li>
<li class="L15686" rel="L15686">hands is not so much as suspended, while the eyes survey the faces in</li>
<li class="L15687" rel="L15687">the tumbrils. Here and there, the inmate has visitors to see the sight;</li>
<li class="L15688" rel="L15688">then he points his finger, with something of the complacency of a</li>
<li class="L15689" rel="L15689">curator or authorised exponent, to this cart and to this, and seems to</li>
<li class="L15690" rel="L15690">tell who sat here yesterday, and who there the day before.</li>
<li class="L15691" rel="L15691"></li>
<li class="L15692" rel="L15692">Of the riders in the tumbrils, some observe these things, and all</li>
<li class="L15693" rel="L15693">things on their last roadside, with an impassive stare; others, with</li>
<li class="L15694" rel="L15694">a lingering interest in the ways of life and men. Some, seated with</li>
<li class="L15695" rel="L15695">drooping heads, are sunk in silent despair; again, there are some so</li>
<li class="L15696" rel="L15696">heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as</li>
<li class="L15697" rel="L15697">they have seen in theatres, and in pictures. Several close their eyes,</li>
<li class="L15698" rel="L15698">and think, or try to get their straying thoughts together. Only one, and</li>
<li class="L15699" rel="L15699">he a miserable creature, of a crazed aspect, is so shattered and made</li>
<li class="L15700" rel="L15700">drunk by horror, that he sings, and tries to dance. Not one of the whole</li>
<li class="L15701" rel="L15701">number appeals by look or gesture, to the pity of the people.</li>
<li class="L15702" rel="L15702"></li>
<li class="L15703" rel="L15703">There is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils,</li>
<li class="L15704" rel="L15704">and faces are often turned up to some of them, and they are asked some</li>
<li class="L15705" rel="L15705">question. It would seem to be always the same question, for, it is</li>
<li class="L15706" rel="L15706">always followed by a press of people towards the third cart. The</li>
<li class="L15707" rel="L15707">horsemen abreast of that cart, frequently point out one man in it with</li>
<li class="L15708" rel="L15708">their swords. The leading curiosity is, to know which is he; he stands</li>
<li class="L15709" rel="L15709">at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down, to converse with a</li>
<li class="L15710" rel="L15710">mere girl who sits on the side of the cart, and holds his hand. He has</li>
<li class="L15711" rel="L15711">no curiosity or care for the scene about him, and always speaks to the</li>
<li class="L15712" rel="L15712">girl. Here and there in the long street of St. Honore, cries are raised</li>
<li class="L15713" rel="L15713">against him. If they move him at all, it is only to a quiet smile, as he</li>
<li class="L15714" rel="L15714">shakes his hair a little more loosely about his face. He cannot easily</li>
<li class="L15715" rel="L15715">touch his face, his arms being bound.</li>
<li class="L15716" rel="L15716"></li>
<li class="L15717" rel="L15717">On the steps of a church, awaiting the coming-up of the tumbrils, stands</li>
<li class="L15718" rel="L15718">the Spy and prison-sheep. He looks into the first of them: not there.</li>
<li class="L15719" rel="L15719">He looks into the second: not there. He already asks himself, “Has he</li>
<li class="L15720" rel="L15720">sacrificed me?” when his face clears, as he looks into the third.</li>
<li class="L15721" rel="L15721"></li>
<li class="L15722" rel="L15722">“Which is Evremonde?” says a man behind him.</li>
<li class="L15723" rel="L15723"></li>
<li class="L15724" rel="L15724">“That. At the back there.”</li>
<li class="L15725" rel="L15725"></li>
<li class="L15726" rel="L15726">“With his hand in the girl&#39;s?”</li>
<li class="L15727" rel="L15727"></li>
<li class="L15728" rel="L15728">“Yes.”</li>
<li class="L15729" rel="L15729"></li>
<li class="L15730" rel="L15730">The man cries, “Down, Evremonde! To the Guillotine all aristocrats!</li>
<li class="L15731" rel="L15731">Down, Evremonde!”</li>
<li class="L15732" rel="L15732"></li>
<li class="L15733" rel="L15733">“Hush, hush!” the Spy entreats him, timidly.</li>

<li class="L15739" rel="L15739"></li>
<li class="L15740" rel="L15740">But the man continuing to exclaim, “Down, Evremonde!” the face of</li>
<li class="L15741" rel="L15741">Evremonde is for a moment turned towards him. Evremonde then sees the</li>
<li class="L15742" rel="L15742">Spy, and looks attentively at him, and goes his way.</li>
<li class="L15743" rel="L15743"></li>
<li class="L15744" rel="L15744">The clocks are on the stroke of three, and the furrow ploughed among the</li>
<li class="L15745" rel="L15745">populace is turning round, to come on into the place of execution, and</li>
<li class="L15746" rel="L15746">end. The ridges thrown to this side and to that, now crumble in and</li>
<li class="L15747" rel="L15747">close behind the last plough as it passes on, for all are following</li>
<li class="L15748" rel="L15748">to the Guillotine. In front of it, seated in chairs, as in a garden of</li>
<li class="L15749" rel="L15749">public diversion, are a number of women, busily knitting. On one of the</li>
<li class="L15750" rel="L15750">fore-most chairs, stands The Vengeance, looking about for her friend.</li>
<li class="L15751" rel="L15751"></li>
<li class="L15752" rel="L15752">“Therese!” she cries, in her shrill tones. “Who has seen her? Therese</li>
<li class="L15753" rel="L15753">Defarge!”</li>
<li class="L15754" rel="L15754"></li>
<li class="L15755" rel="L15755">“She never missed before,” says a knitting-woman of the sisterhood.</li>
<li class="L15756" rel="L15756"></li>
<li class="L15757" rel="L15757">“No; nor will she miss now,” cries The Vengeance, petulantly. “Therese.”</li>
<li class="L15758" rel="L15758"></li>
<li class="L15759" rel="L15759">“Louder,” the woman recommends.</li>
<li class="L15760" rel="L15760"></li>
<li class="L15761" rel="L15761">Ay! Louder, Vengeance, much louder, and still she will scarcely hear</li>
<li class="L15762" rel="L15762">thee. Louder yet, Vengeance, with a little oath or so added, and yet</li>
<li class="L15763" rel="L15763">it will hardly bring her. Send other women up and down to seek her,</li>
<li class="L15764" rel="L15764">lingering somewhere; and yet, although the messengers have done dread</li>
<li class="L15765" rel="L15765">deeds, it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far</li>
<li class="L15766" rel="L15766">enough to find her!</li>
<li class="L15767" rel="L15767"></li>
<li class="L15768" rel="L15768">“Bad Fortune!” cries The Vengeance, stamping her foot in the chair, “and</li>
<li class="L15769" rel="L15769">here are the tumbrils! And Evremonde will be despatched in a wink, and</li>
<li class="L15770" rel="L15770">she not here! See her knitting in my hand, and her empty chair ready for</li>
<li class="L15771" rel="L15771">her. I cry with vexation and disappointment!”</li>
<li class="L15772" rel="L15772"></li>
<li class="L15773" rel="L15773">As The Vengeance descends from her elevation to do it, the tumbrils</li>
<li class="L15774" rel="L15774">begin to discharge their loads. The ministers of Sainte Guillotine are</li>
<li class="L15775" rel="L15775">robed and ready. Crash!--A head is held up, and the knitting-women who</li>
<li class="L15776" rel="L15776">scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could</li>
<li class="L15777" rel="L15777">think and speak, count One.</li>
<li class="L15778" rel="L15778"></li>
<li class="L15779" rel="L15779">The second tumbril empties and moves on; the third comes up. Crash!--And</li>
<li class="L15780" rel="L15780">the knitting-women, never faltering or pausing in their Work, count Two.</li>
<li class="L15781" rel="L15781"></li>
<li class="L15782" rel="L15782">The supposed Evremonde descends, and the seamstress is lifted out next</li>
<li class="L15783" rel="L15783">after him. He has not relinquished her patient hand in getting out, but</li>
<li class="L15784" rel="L15784">still holds it as he promised. He gently places her with her back to the</li>
<li class="L15785" rel="L15785">crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls, and she looks into</li>
<li class="L15786" rel="L15786">his face and thanks him.</li>
<li class="L15787" rel="L15787"></li>
<li class="L15788" rel="L15788">“But for you, dear stranger, I should not be so composed, for I am</li>
<li class="L15789" rel="L15789">naturally a poor little thing, faint of heart; nor should I have been</li>
<li class="L15790" rel="L15790">able to raise my thoughts to Him who was put to death, that we might</li>
<li class="L15791" rel="L15791">have hope and comfort here to-day. I think you were sent to me by</li>
<li class="L15792" rel="L15792">Heaven.”</li>
<li class="L15793" rel="L15793"></li>
<li class="L15794" rel="L15794">“Or you to me,” says Sydney Carton. “Keep your eyes upon me, dear child,</li>

<li class="L15796" rel="L15796"></li>
<li class="L15797" rel="L15797">“I mind nothing while I hold your hand. I shall mind nothing when I let</li>

<li class="L15799" rel="L15799"></li>
<li class="L15800" rel="L15800">“They will be rapid. Fear not!”</li>
<li class="L15801" rel="L15801"></li>
<li class="L15802" rel="L15802">The two stand in the fast-thinning throng of victims, but they speak as</li>
<li class="L15803" rel="L15803">if they were alone. Eye to eye, voice to voice, hand to hand, heart to</li>
<li class="L15804" rel="L15804">heart, these two children of the Universal Mother, else so wide apart</li>
<li class="L15805" rel="L15805">and differing, have come together on the dark highway, to repair home</li>
<li class="L15806" rel="L15806">together, and to rest in her bosom.</li>
<li class="L15807" rel="L15807"></li>
<li class="L15808" rel="L15808">“Brave and generous friend, will you let me ask you one last question? I</li>
<li class="L15809" rel="L15809">am very ignorant, and it troubles me--just a little.”</li>
<li class="L15810" rel="L15810"></li>
<li class="L15811" rel="L15811">“Tell me what it is.”</li>
<li class="L15812" rel="L15812"></li>
<li class="L15813" rel="L15813">“I have a cousin, an only relative and an orphan, like myself, whom I</li>
<li class="L15814" rel="L15814">love very dearly. She is five years younger than I, and she lives in a</li>
<li class="L15815" rel="L15815">farmer&#39;s house in the south country. Poverty parted us, and she knows</li>
<li class="L15816" rel="L15816">nothing of my fate--for I cannot write--and if I could, how should I</li>
<li class="L15817" rel="L15817">tell her! It is better as it is.”</li>
<li class="L15818" rel="L15818"></li>

<li class="L15821" rel="L15821">“What I have been thinking as we came along, and what I am still</li>
<li class="L15822" rel="L15822">thinking now, as I look into your kind strong face which gives me so</li>
<li class="L15823" rel="L15823">much support, is this:--If the Republic really does good to the poor,</li>
<li class="L15824" rel="L15824">and they come to be less hungry, and in all ways to suffer less, she may</li>

<li class="L15829" rel="L15829">“Do you think:” the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much</li>
<li class="L15830" rel="L15830">endurance, fill with tears, and the lips part a little more and tremble:</li>
<li class="L15831" rel="L15831">“that it will seem long to me, while I wait for her in the better land</li>
<li class="L15832" rel="L15832">where I trust both you and I will be mercifully sheltered?”</li>

<li class="L15843" rel="L15843">a sweet, bright constancy is in the patient face. She goes next before</li>

<li class="L15857" rel="L15857">They said of him, about the city that night, that it was the</li>
<li class="L15858" rel="L15858">peacefullest man&#39;s face ever beheld there. Many added that he looked</li>
<li class="L15859" rel="L15859">sublime and prophetic.</li>
<li class="L15860" rel="L15860"></li>
<li class="L15861" rel="L15861">One of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axe--a woman--had asked</li>
<li class="L15862" rel="L15862">at the foot of the same scaffold, not long before, to be allowed to</li>
<li class="L15863" rel="L15863">write down the thoughts that were inspiring her. If he had given any</li>
<li class="L15864" rel="L15864">utterance to his, and they were prophetic, they would have been these:</li>

<li class="L15868" rel="L15868">the old, perishing by this retributive instrument, before it shall cease</li>
<li class="L15869" rel="L15869">out of its present use. I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people</li>
<li class="L15870" rel="L15870">rising from this abyss, and, in their struggles to be truly free, in</li>
<li class="L15871" rel="L15871">their triumphs and defeats, through long years to come, I see the evil</li>
<li class="L15872" rel="L15872">of this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural</li>

<li class="L15877" rel="L15877">Her with a child upon her bosom, who bears my name. I see her father,</li>
